In some Member States, it is not simply a question of informing an opinion which is not as well informed as it could be.This is certainly important but it is also a question of fighting against disinformation propagated by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organizations that exist.The commission must be very vigorous in the responses it will advance to certain comments which will reach it within the framework of this campaign.Mr. Corbett, thank you for your appreciation.I gladly accept your invitation and, if I understood correctly, you want that, when I come to the Yorkshire, I not only mention the reform of the European institutions, but also the structural funds.I will therefore come to do this double task.I forgot, moreover, to say the concern I have to go, and I have already done it, before the national parliaments, not only by meeting their representatives here, but by going to see them on the spot.Ten days ago, I was in Westminster.You see, Mr. Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties.I'm going to Bundestag next week in Berlin.I went to the French Senate.So, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will directly see the national parliaments.It is not a question, with regard to dialogue with citizens, of making propaganda or marketing, not even communication.I would like this dialogue to be really a dialogue, and that after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of the institutional reform, those who are here in the gallery can intervene and respond to open micro.We will, I repeat, conduct this initiative for dialogue in punctual or structured cooperation with the Member States, and I wish, with your support, that the governments of the fifteen can be associated, according to the methods that they will judge the most timely and the most adequate, with this initiative of dialogue.Mr. President, I would like to join the Circle of Studies created by Mr. Barnier and comprising 700 trainees so that he has people with whom to discuss.It is hardly pleasant to have to discuss transparency or problems relating to the intergovernmental conference.With regard to the intergovernmental conference, Mr. Barnier declared, during his presentation before the Assembly, that social policy would not be the subject of decisions taken by majority, but I note, when reading page 63, that the fight against discrimination, that freedom of movement and that the right of stay - that is to say the directives on the right of stay - that the whole social security,social policy will be the subject of a vote - with a few exceptions - a qualified majority.Does Mr. Barnier cares that he is attacking the very nerve of the legislative process of the Member States?It is to defend these questions that people go to the polls to determine a new majority in the Danish Parliament or to any other parliament.Can these questions be managed by Brussels?Are we here in the decentralization process that Mr. Prodi told us about this morning?	fr
In my opinion, this is completely impossible to accept this, and I will ask you, moreover, I have written to you with my colleague Hautala to contact the British authorities in order to prevent this anymore and to apologize for a member Lucas. Thanks, member Lannoye. I have indeed received your letter and I have already contacted the British representation. Mr President, I would like to ask for something that I brought up yesterday in an oral debate on the report on the Equal initiative yesterday. I ask you to postpone the voting on the Equal initiative, because we simply need a little time to arrange an important point. I am optimistic and I am really waiting for the vote to be restful and confident;In the vote, we will find the widest possible approval for this Equal Initiative Communication. We only need a little more time to complete the details of the asylum issue, and therefore ask for the vote today instead of today. Mr President, I would continue with a member of Lannoye from the issue: Member Lucas was arrested outside of Glasgow in a demonstration against the Tridlan base in Fasla. I understand a good demonstration. However, I do not understand at all that member Lucas is trying to hide behind his parliamentary integrity. I, too, have been arrested when I pointed my mind in Fasla. I did not hide behind any integrity. I received the punishment given to me. Member of the Parliament Lucas should do the same. Mr President, I would like to say, at the request of a few words in Parliament Stenzel, to transfer the voting on the Equal Community Initiative for tomorrow. The debate on this initiative was indeed very lively in the committee, and since this is a major Commission proposal that refers to the agreements we reached last year, I think it can be accepted. We agree with Member of Parliament Stenzel that a request for deferral can be accepted so that different groups can converge as much as possible, and thus the parliament could express their views on this initiative. Do some colleagues want to speak against this request made by Member Stenzel, to whom the member Ghilardot just supported? As there are no requests for speech, we vote at the request of Member Stenzel.(Parliament approved the request.) Mr President, in accordance with Article 29 (4) of the Rules of Procedure, political groups must inform you of members who have joined a new political group or who have resigned from a political group. Have you received a declaration that members of the European People's Party have resigned or does the Austrian People's Party still belong to that political group? Member Corbett, I haven't received any notice. Dear President, I'm still very amazed at these colleague Corbett's reactions. He should look for other opportunities for profiling than to take a stand here in Parliament! We are solidarity with our Austrian friends who have proved to be good European in the past. We give them our full support!(Applause) agenda as long as the agenda of Thursday's session, I suggest to you because of a request in the plenary session yesterday that the discussion on important, current and urgent topics will be extended by half an hour, ie that it will be continued until 6:00 pm and that the vote will be held at 6 pm.(Parliament approved the proposal.) The Commission's Strategic Objectives and Legislative Program The following is a joint debate on the Commission's statement on the Commission's five -year strategic objectives and the 2000 legislative program. I will give the chairman immediately to Prod. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, the five -year program has very far -reaching effects, and therefore it was best for me to share the text of the whole statement to you all, it is available in four languages. In order not to exceed the restrictions imposed by the time I have available, I will only refer to the big lines of my program: this is a program of the beginning of a new parliamentary term and also a program of the beginning of the new century, which is justified and necessary to look at Europe from a broader point of view, Europe, which is currently in a contradictory situation.	fi
The two large groups share all reports, general reports, etc. between them. In order to change this non -democratic process, we, the DR/EES team, filed the amendment no.6. This amendment requests that the rapporteurs, the rapporteurs, and the members of the working groups be appointed, based on clear and democratic rules. In this context, small groups and representativeness must be taken into account. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues. First of all, I would also like to congratulate our colleague Mr. Corrie on the quality of his report, which presents the content of the discussions of the Equal Representation Assembly, in which Mr Corrie was a successful chairman. The elimination of poverty was at the heart of our work and in achieving this ambitious goal, many interveners have emphasized the need to safeguard a basic means, that is, the preferable agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries in the context of Lema contracts. It was a very important challenge. The globalization, the liberation of transactions, as well as the supremacy of the WTO and the supranational philosophy it promotes, endangered the very essence of the dialogue between the North-South. Consequently, the conclusion of the new corporate relationship agreement on development can only be happy and I am convinced that the work of the last meeting of equal representation had a decisive impact on the release of negotiations as well as the new climate created by the events of Seattle. However, although I am happy to renew the agreements, what I find is interesting is the new wind that is now in our relationships and manifested through the balanced nature of the completed negotiations. I believe that the European Union has finally abandoned the old paternalistic logic, and to be honest, the neo -colonial logic of funders, who are usually trying to impose their opinion, as our friend Michel Rocard is used to saying. The Union has finally accepted the idea that no dialogue is authentic or effective unless it leads to the conclusion of a contract that respects the dignity of the partners. Refusing to use the concept of proper management by technocrats as a means of a new restriction, the European Union acts in a wise and moderate manner. It took two centuries to lay the foundations of a democracy, the fragile character of which is constantly reminiscent of the timeliness. With what right do we want to impose our model on peoples whose history, values, identity sometimes differ from our own? As far as I am concerned, I am in favor of the desire, which has become clearly clearly under these agreements, that is to say, cooperation between two new bodies - local organizations, non -governmental organizations -, which I consider to be the only way to gradually own the peoples of these countries. In a nutshell, in order to go through the humiliating and childish help in responsibility, which is a guarantee of efficiency. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Lord Rapporteur, colleagues, I would also like to congratulate Mr Alexander Corrie first on the clarity and rigor that characterize the summary presentation of his report.	el
Fourth point on which Ms. Hedkvist Petersen insisted at the moment, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and for young people.Fifth point, the importance and role of small and medium -sized enterprises, Mr. Vatanen said it with great vehemence earlier.Finally, the positive effects on the national administrations of the structural fund management system, the motivation of civil servants when they manage these funds, even if it is sometimes complicated, and the importance of making improvements to the procedures for assessment, monitoring and control of the committee again.I inform the European Parliament on this subject of my intention to organize in the middle of the year 2000 a seminar with the national and regional authorities on this question of evaluating procedures for exchanging good practices in the management of structural funds.I would like to mention some specific points.Mr. Berend, you wanted the zoning to be quickly implemented.We finish with the zoning.Tomorrow, four new countries will be the subject of a decision by the Commission and very soon, I hope, it will be the turn of Italy.So, you will be satisfied on this point, since all the countries concerned by objective 2 will be zoned.Regarding the underground economy that you evoke in your report, I know that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are based on the reliability of the data and as Mr. Cocilovo has mentioned, there is a problem of reliability of this data.To a certain extent, they are included in account in GDP statistics, surveys on labor forces, and in any event, I would like to underline the efforts that Eurostat makes and will continue to improve the quality of statistics.You have also mentioned, Mr. Berend, such as Mr. Aparicio Sánchez, the absence of reform of the fishing sector.On this point which interests me personally, I will recall that the small size of this sector - which does not mean that it is negligible - and its concentration in a very low number of regions do not facilitate its analysis in a regional framework.This type of sectoral analysis is more of the practice and competence of the Directorate General of Fisheries, under the authority of my colleague Fischler.However, I would like to assure you that the Commission will endeavor to include such an analysis in the second report on cohesion which will undoubtedly be better for these concerns.Several of you have mentioned points that must be inserted into this second report on cohesion and your rapporteur mentioned some of these points.First of all, I want to make sure that the merger of periodic reports and the cohesion report should not lead to any loss of information or a loss of interest in the content of this report on cohesion which, for me, is an extremely important instrument, not only for us to account for what is done and that we say it transparent and rigorous, so that we are examining orAlso to create a public debate with citizens and, beyond, with the elected officials that you are, on this regional policy and on what could one day be a European regional planning policy.	fr
What criteria will the Commission be based on accepting or rejecting these programs by Member States?Which committee will check the financing of the steering group and the accompanying committee as well as the correct and proper execution of the program?Since the contribution of the European Social Fund for the period 2000-2006 amounts to EUR 2.487 billion and the Equal initiative is co-financed by the Member States, the Commission is requested for a message how high the contribution of Greece will be.The Equal initiative is not limited to certain groups of people.It aims to combat discrimination on the labor market.The initiative was decided in Berlin, and there it was also determined that in the relevant actions, professional groups of asylum seekers must also be taken into account and must be included in them.I would like to highlight this important element of the initiative.The programs of the Member States elaborated as part of the community initiative must correspond to the provisions provided for in the regulation on the social fund.The Equal initiative is therefore subject to the regulation for the social fund.It was submitted to the parliament and we expect his statement next month.I have to emphasize that equal corresponds to the national needs and planning that are defined according to the agreed European strategy.The Member States or the national governments are primarily responsible for the establishment of the common sponsors, for the submission of the proposals, for the selection of those who are supposed to implement the programs, as well as for control.The General Directorate for Employment is responsible for implementation within the European Commission, and in addition, budget control is of course exercised by the General Directorate for Financial Control, the Office for Combat and the European Court of Auditors.A last part of the request finally affected the amount of the contribution provided.Greece was granted 98 million ECU.The subsidies are 80 %, in the case of the island regions and above all the remote Greek islands, the initiative participates with up to 85 %, with the own share of 15 %.Mr President, the guidelines for the Equal Community Initiative, in particular the four actions specified in it, lead to a very complicated, bureaucratic, paradoxically, but also non -transparent structures.For example, one wonders how a development partnership should prove that it fulfills the conditions of cooperation and representativity, as required in paragraph 33 of the information on action 2.On the other hand, the commitment to transnational cooperation and the complicated requirements for the planning and implementation of development partnerships inevitably lead to major projects, since only they can meet these conditions.However, this contradicts the declared intention to focus on decentralized action plans, at the level of the local authorities and in the agar regions.At the same time, the participation of the actually disadvantaged, namely the asylum seeker, the immigrants and others, is made impossible or limited to a symbolic level.If you finally consider how small the total is - 2.8 billion euros for 15 countries and such ambitious goals - then I am afraid, we will only succeed in proving which evil is unemployment.Since we are now in the phase of elaboration by the parliament, I would like to say firstly that it would really be helpful in every respect if they submitted concrete suggestions that we can take into account.	de
I appreciate that the parliament in the sensitive and complicated question of how the fees for water supply services has been flexible.I can only support the demand for a design of the water prices that are incentives for users to use water resources in a sustainable manner.In addition, I advise that the individual economic areas should adequately participate in covering the costs of the water supply services and can thus adopt the amendments 43-46 and change application 85 in principle.In my opinion, we need legally binding regulations for the costs for water services to be covered by every economic area itself.This represents a clear economic goal in which the progress achieved can be measured.That is why I support the overarching objective of change application 105, which corresponds to the original proposal of the Commission.I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering the environmental and resource costs.We are aware that pricing for water and water services is an extremely complicated question and that not only environmental goals, but also social and economic goals have to be taken into account.However, this must not serve as an excuse for subsidizing contaminant and ineffective economic areas.A message from the Commission is planned for the next future, which deals with exactly this question.Like the parliament, I am of the opinion that the period specified in the common point of view must be significantly shortened for the implementation of the directive.The same applies to the possibility of an extension granted by another 18 years.Change application 28, in which the third extension was deleted, represents a step in the right direction and can therefore be accepted.A period of 10 years, such asOn the other hand, 24 and 26 were proposed in the change applications.In my opinion, one should consider to include an express and mandatory provision to avoid deterioration in the comprehensive definition of the design of the design.The draft must also contain stricter criteria for the extension of deadlines for significantly changed or artificial water bodies and to determine less strict environmental goals.This applies to change applications 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104. These can essentially be assumed and are supported to achieve an overarching solution.However, the claim made in amendments 27 and 29 that the Commission must agree to any extension goes too far and cannot therefore be accepted.Another important area is the protection of the groundwater.In order to break the pollution trend at the moment, we need both a starting point and an end goal.Strictive criteria for the interpretation of surveillance results are also essential.The most important sections of the change applications 25 and 73 of the parliament can therefore be accepted in principle.However, the new definition in change application 72 is too strict and cannot be used for these purposes.I suggest involving a change application 92 in a broader solution.In amendment application 71, the seasonal differences and the annual changes in groundwater levels are not taken into account.	de
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament played a pioneering role in the affirmation of human rights within the European Union.We know that governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik, commercial, geostrategic or economic interests.We have defined conditions for states wishing to enter our union and we must also define conditions for states whose candidacy we support.Because we are one of those who believe in democracy and its values.We know that freedom of the press and public information are the lungs of democracy.The air of press freedom must blow on a democratic state.And democracy must also go hand in hand with a free and informed public opinion.And there is no free and informed public opinion without social communication without supervision, and there is no free social communication and no guardianship if journalists are prosecuted, arrested or threatened.Mr. President, in the same way that we condemned in all legitimacy the actions of the Unita, which questioned the peace process in Angola, and which we firmly invited the two parties to arrest war and make peace, we condemn the persecutions and threats today and we pray to the Angolan government to let the journalists work in complete freedom, the latter being the prerogative of a state and a democratic society.Mr. President, how long will we be able to continue cooperation with Angola?Human rights are systematically and permanently flouted there, not only by Unita but also by the government itself.The trials brought against journalists go against all legal principles.The Angolan government must immediately authorize a significant presence of the UN which can play the intermediaries and inform us about human rights.Likewise, European observers must be admitted to the hearings of the journalists' trials.Europe, for a great donor that it is, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola.If the Angolan government continues to refuse to cooperate, we cannot do without taking action.Without national reconciliation, no reconciliation with Europe is possible.Angola will then remain, alas, a gross diamond.Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I totally agree with the resolution which is under discussion in Parliament;I agree because the situation of repression that weighs on journalists, whether it is Angolan or foreign correspondents in Angola, is so serious and scandalous that we cannot close our eyes.But this resolution is insufficient, because in reality, it starts from the principle that Angola is a rule of law which imposes certain difficulties on journalists and represses them.But there is not the subject.Angola is not a rule of law, it is a repressive dictatorship.Angola is at war, a cruel war which continues.And we cannot accept the theory in force according to which we must crush and physically eliminate the opponent to obtain peace.Consequently, repeated calls of the Angolan church, the calls that Mandela and Mebeki made yesterday for new negotiations to be started in favor of peace must be supported by Parliament.We must therefore undertake, as has already been said by another colleague, a general debate on Angola, and not only on the situation of certain journalists victims of repression in Angola.	fr
Without ensuring the means necessary to pursue environmental protection, it is made without content to strengthen the importance of the environment that has taken place in recent years on the one hand and the integration of the environmental aspect into other policies on the other. In addition, the increased challenges in the surroundings of the Union, as well as the treatment of acute problems in the field of environmental protection in candidate countries, cannot leave us indifferent. The event is the event, Mr President, with the contamination of the Danube's tributary and the Danube in recent days. Therefore, I believe that strengthening the environmental actions through the Financial Media LIFE ensures promotion to community policy in the environment and contributes significantly to the fulfillment of the community mission for a high level of environmental protection and improvement.(ppe-de).(It) Mr President, I would first like to congratulate Lienemann's colleague on the great sensitivity he has shown to the environment in the two exhibitions discussed tonight. Two minutes is not enough to talk about such an important issue. So I only call for a call to the Mrs. Commissioner: to seriously reflect on a matter of so much importance. For five years I have been in charge of the Environment Committee in another body that, having a regional nature, certainly does not have as wide as a wide view as the European Parliament. The state of the environment seems extremely serious. Like colleagues who spoke before me, I would like to stand on the financial issue once again and on the funding of projects that, in my opinion, should all be public. Financials: Mrs Commissioner, 613 million euros are not enough. Not even 850 million euros are sufficient. At the end of August I attended a meeting of the Environment Committee where the amount of 2m euros, or 4,000 billion rituals, to eliminate, or at least reduce smoking problems, had been reported. But the environment is a much more serious and much more important problem than smoking. EUR 850 million - assuming that this funding will really be granted - I assure you, Mrs. Commissioner, they are not enough to accomplish any kind of plan. In many areas, parks have been created, which in the LIFE program are an element of capital. But parks created by minimal financial means and that do not signal are ineffective and useless. That is why I call on the parliament and the committee to pay close attention to this issue., Commission.(Sv) Mr President, MPs, MPs, MPs, since the beginning of 1999 are discussions between the institutions regarding the proposed regulation on the third phase of the environmental financial average. I would like to reiterate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, as well as Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive cooperation we had on this issue. As a result, I can assert that the Commission fully accepts, or partly 9 of the 14 amendment proposals approved by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy.	el
This would jeopardize a greater number of jobs, as well as the credibility of this assembly by showing how far we are from the real world.Consequently, I urged this assembly to reject the entire report and to bring any amendment to the original proposal of the Commission whose balance was excellent.Mr. President, we cannot vote in favor of this report.Indeed, the European Union should put the social to the curled of its construction.It is social rights that should order economic choices and not the other way around.This is why we are opposed to the implementation, concerning social protection, of mechanisms copied to the Luxembourg process which go against this logic: main economic orientations, then criteria of convergence and, finally, the social which is treated in a residual way.The European Union should affirm a general principle: social rights acquired in states cannot be reduced.Any community intervention should aim to complete, then to harmonize from above, the existing guarantees.To strengthen the financing of social protection systems, a policy of general wages are required, the establishment of a legal minimum wage in each of the Member States.To fight poverty, the right to income and the right to employment are inseparable.Finally, to avoid any commodification of health, the European Union should decide clearly against pension funds and oppose that private insurance companies have access to the health system.I really believe, to conclude, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with speeches and vux piles.The situation is too tragic for millions of people.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, the objective of developing a concerted strategy to modernize social protection within the European Union is undoubtedly a good thing, in the same way as the kick -off, with the Luxembourg summit, of the European Convergence for Employment and Employment Policy.The job market and social protection are in fact both sides of the same medal which requires that policies and regulations are synchronized.If the job market is effective in terms of employment levels, flexibility and wage efficiency, the Welfare State and social protection cannot be able to be, and vice versa.Previously, European countries each defined on their side, in quasi-approval, the operating and financing rules of the two markets.Budget and exchange policies were there to ensure internal and external balance.With Maastricht and the single currency, budgetary policies have been seriously limited and it is no longer possible to resort to devaluation, to seek lost margins.The structural and cyclical differences between countries can therefore no longer catch up by the deficit and the change.Things being what they are, in the absence of full mobility of employment within the Union and a redistributive tax policy at the confederal level, the only degree of flexibility is left labor and social protection to rectify both structural and cyclical imbalances, what are called asymmetrical exogenous shocks.	fr
Please support the checkers and the national emission limits presented by the United Nations in the Gothenburg table. Mr President, at first I would like to thank the rapporteur Myller for his report and his ambitious way to deal with the Directive proposed by the Commission. Although the Industrial, Foreign Trade, Research and Energy Committee seems to be a bit surprised, we can still declare that the acidification problem is not a new issue, but it has existed as long as industrialization- 100 years. It has been studied for 30 years. None of us should have any doubt as to what the acidification is, nor what should be done for it. Some blame the Commission's proposal and report on exaggeration and far too expensive, and believe that the calculations drawn up are utopian. However, it is wrong to say, because we know that the Member States themselves have participated in reporting on which the entire directive is based. Rather, we can be critical that we have not included the energy scenario we otherwise emphasized, as a different brand in the Kyoto minutes, namely that we are going to reduce the burning of fossil fuels to survive the climate problems in front of us. All honor to the Gothenburg minutes, and although it is named after my hometown, I still have to say that the Gothenburg minutes cannot really be compared to the directive we decide tomorrow. One can only amazed why the Commission Directive is only given a month later, almost as a punishment for the UN Directive, but it is because we have dealt so slowly - nothing else. If we had dealt with it a little faster, this directive would have been ready much before the so -called Gothenburg minutes before. The directive is called impossible, but I would like to say that our current situation is impossible. So it is not a directive but the current situation. Mr President, congratulations on the Member of the Parliament, which I know that this report has long and thoroughly considered. In my opinion, this debate is concentrated on the following question: Do we believe that the Gothenburg minutes were the best result that Member States can be realistically achieved? I find that the Commission and the environmental organizations believe that in practice, much more could be achieved and that some Member States are in any case committed to significantly reduce without impurities - even though it is not true for everyone. A few Member States seem to have come with the consultation with an envelope with a few calculations and refused to make any concessions to set themselves realistic goals. Some have not even used the same method, the same calculation base as the others. The minutes are therefore useless in many respects. It cannot in any way strengthen our confidence. It is a messy political compromise and nothing else. I do not know how much a member of the Commission can still improve the situation, but we should try to reduce without impurities and should support his efforts in the negotiations. We should support this report and give him our support. Mr President, my colleague Myller, has made a very good report, and our group also thinks we have to go much further than in the Gothenburg minutes. In the preparation of this directive, a national auction has probably been held, and the end result is quite modest when it comes to what the real challenges are. But in any case, it is important that the European Parliament now defends at least the line chosen by the Commission. The Greens / European Free Alliance group proposes that 2010 be set for even stricter goals than the proposed by the Committee on Environmental Health, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We want to emphasize the need to introduce an integrated strategy to reduce emissions. It must be remembered that in any case, we will be ahead to achieve the goals of the Kyoto Protocol, which requires that energy use must be intensified and that energy is simply less.	fi
These are the reasons why the orientations are presented according to thematic priorities, because they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to various degrees according to the specific situations of each of the Member States and the regions.I would now like to respond quickly to some of the observations you made, ladies and gentlemen, on the procedure, first of all.It is true that the consultation of your assembly intervened late.Let me remind you that when the orientations were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a project, in February 1999, following a new procedure intended to facilitate the presentation of comments on this text, they were immediately submitted by my predecessor, Monica Wulf-Mathies, in Parliament.But given the proximity of the European elections, it is, in fact, that after the final adoption of the text, in July 1999, that your assembly was able to undertake the examination of these orientations.Arriving in this college, among you, I want, ladies and gentlemen, to ensure that, in the programs negotiations, which are only in their very beginning, - President Hatzidakis had questioned me on this subject - for most of the Member States, your observations will be really taken into consideration.And I can assure you, moreover that, when the Commission will adopt the orientations with a view to what is called the mid-term revision, as provided for in the regulations, it will also be taken into account from the point of view of your assembly, the one expressed in this report.On the merits now, concerning the role of guidelines, Madam Rapporteur, you stressed that it is in this context that it is a question of providing guidelines on a certain number of European objectives, often very precise.I do not quote them all: the implementation of intersectoral policies, increase the effectiveness of the use of public funds, help the various partners to build together regional or national programming, etc.The Commission takes note of this, but several of these guidelines or these questions are more of other documents such as the Vade-Mecum or the methodological working document.Finally, I would like to focus on certain arrests of which you have echoed, Madam Rapporteur.I think, for example, of the idea that the orientations are not sufficiently specific in their recommendations.This assertion of your report must be submitted in the perspective of last spring negotiations.The Commission has been held in the very text of article 10 of the General Regulations of Structural Funds, which provides that these guidelines are aimed at providing member states with general indicative guidelines, based on relevant and agreed community policies.It is the very text that I quoted, in quotes.In addition, guidelines cannot replace programming or ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify the priorities and efficiency of these programs.You then mentioned, Madam Rapporteur, the section of orientations relating to urban and rural development, stressing that urban development would not be sufficiently taken into account.	fr
We will certainly lift the point mentioned by the Honorable Parliamentarian.We have heard the concerns expressed in this regard and I will ensure that it is taken into account.Considerable concerns have also been expressed about the potential danger that the archaeological heritage of the region ran.We will also lift this last point in the observations that we will formulate.A number of other hydroelectric projects provided by Turkey in the past thirty years have also been concerned, such as the effect they had on moved farmers.Overall, they seem to have been treated in a relatively satisfactory manner and I hope that this will be identical for this project in which the Commission - so that things are clear - does not participate in any way.Question nº 39 of (H-0036/00): Object: Development of the Charter of Fundamental Rights while congratulating, on behalf of all citizens, the development of a charter of fundamental rights, and by forming the view that this will be able to meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century, I would nevertheless wish to ask the Commission the following questions: What are its positions on the content of the Charter?What citizens is this charter intended for (those of the European Union or, with a view to enlargement, of all European countries, includes migrants, etc.)?Will the charter integrate the social achievements of the European Union, or will it have a broader programmatic character?What will be the mechanisms put into work to clearly translate equality between the two sexes in fact?What does the Charter Integration Commission think in the Treaty on the European Union?Like the Honorable Parliamentarian, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the heads of state and government to launch the process of drafting a charter of fundamental rights of the European Union.The heads of state and government have set themselves, in the conclusions of the Cologne European Council, the main lines of the content of the charter.According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights: rights of freedom, equality and procedure, as guaranteed by the European Convention on Human Rights, the rights reserved for citizens of the Union and economic and social rights, as stated in the European Social Charter and in the Community Charter of Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not justify the objectives for the action of the Union.The Commission considers that the convention responsible for the development of the Charter of Fundamental Rights must comply with the mandate given to it by the European Council of Cologne.However, this does not mean that the convention must be limited to a coodifier role of simple compilation of existing rights from different sources.As I have already had the opportunity to say it before this Parliament, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, adapt and develop these rights taking into account current circumstances, in particular technological and social developments.	fr
It is quite essential.It should also be remembered that no one voluntarily renounces power, whether man or woman.Men never wanted to abandon their position of strength when they enjoyed it, but very rare are also the women who were kind enough to abandon their strength position, and I think here in particular their position of strength vis -à -vis children.I would also like to say in this regard that this is perhaps one of the reasons why there are so few men here today.We would of course like to be able to have this debate more or less between us for the same reasons of power policy.What I wanted to emphasize here is that this is a transfer of power on the part of the two parties.The commissioner stressed that it was necessary to use a combination of many different measures, and she cited Finland and Sweden namely.I would simply say for information that she could also have quoted Denmark very well.I obviously say that because I come from Denmark.The Danish government is actually made up of 45 % of women, which is actually slightly higher than Finland.We have, it is true, no president, but we have a queen, which can in a certain sense be considered equivalent.I would now like to approach some of the points cited by the commissioner, namely the question of financial resources.It is absolutely necessary that we accept the fact that, if women want to obtain short -term equality, it will cost money.It is also necessary, in the short term, to seek that our children are kept and educated in a responsible manner.There is therefore the question of adequate structures.One may wonder if traditional industrial culture is really good, and I am therefore very happy with the very active participation of the Portuguese Minister in the Lisbon conference devoted, among other things, to the development of information technologies.I believe that there are possibilities more particularly for women, precisely because there is no question of hierarchy, but rather of horizontal structures.The evolution of things leads to believe, in any case in Denmark, that there are more and more women entrepreneurs.There are two points that have not been mentioned and that I would like to quote to conclude.The first concerns the influence of the media.I think it is very important that we studied stereotypes developed by the media.Does this pose a particular problem?I must say that I don't know precisely.I have the impression that yes, but I am not sure.The second concerns enlargement.I think it is very important in this regard to underline now that we must also set certain requirements so that the new Member States are represented by both men and women, which will also support women in these countries.I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner when she says that it is time for the beautiful speeches to translate into acts.	fr
Completely summary, huge mass unemployment not only is not mitigated, but on the contrary it is further exacerbated in the context of structural policy. The agricultural economy and rural areas are irreparably affected by regional policy, with dramatic consequences for employment in the countryside and terms of life of farmers, especially in the South. Regional inequalities are dramatically expanded within the Member States. If we look at the details of the sixth exhibition, we will see that there are huge divergences of peripheral inequalities in the last decade. Little to existent is the attention to the huge problems of the island regions of the Union whose deficiencies in infrastructure, transport, communications, energy lead to rejected. All this is responsible for both the regional and the general economic and social policy of the Union. Large parts of the peoples of the Union strongly condemn this policy as dangerous and anti -populist. The new guidelines are unfortunately moved in the same direction and nothing shows that it is possible to change with the application of these guidelines. Mr President, dear colleagues, let me briefly expose certain thoughts, emphasizing two points that are highlighted in these reports and which are of essential strategic importance in view of the perspective we chart the Union. The first concerns the fundamental and prime importance we continue to attribute to the beginning of economic and social cohesion. And we express concerns when we learn that the importance of this goal is slowly starting to fade into the perception of the committee. For our part, we still consider that economic and social cohesion is one of the central goals of the Union. Secondly, I agree with what a colleague who preceded the particular problems of the islands said and I would like, by the way, to draw your attention to the highly remote regions. We would like in the future we will find a more bold attitude when addressing the problems of highly remote regions, such as in terms of my country, in the case of the Azoros and Madeira islands. And I take the opportunity to ask the Commission, if it can, to clarify why it is delayed by the submission of its report on highly remote regions, which we have been expecting for some time in Parliament. Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, including for her willingness to include our own suggestions in the exhibition. Mr President, Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Commissioner, with the help of the guidelines will provide the Member States an orientation to achieve the objectives of reform under planning. However, the relevant instructions of the Commission, contrary to their goal of being an orientation, are rather a list of measures that can be taken in the context of policy sectors. But their main mission is to mark direction and set priorities. I agree with the rapporteur that the Commission's document includes, unfortunately, minimal recommendations to the Member States for the simplification of administrative procedures, and I emphasize requirements such as focusing on the negotiations in promoting a favorable environment for SMEs, in a clear targeting for alternatives toRisk for private funding, supporting new businesses, including new information technologies and investment in innovative sectors.	el
It requires anticipation, early preparation and careful control of these processes. Thirdly, effective and extensive communication and consultation at the time of employee and staff representatives, before such reforms are commenced or publicly communicated, cannot be omitted on any basis. Participation of employees is always, and especially in the context of corporate reorganization, not only their fundamental rights but also a necessary prerequisite for such reforms to be considered socially acceptable. Ultimately, it is also a decisive factor in their success, as no company can survive and succeed without the confidence, dialogue, partnership and solidarity between its different components. These basic ideas have been approved in Europe in general. A rational restructuring is made up of these issues. Companies are becoming less and less likely to implement harmful restructuring that do not take into account these basics, as in the past, sometimes happened in the past. We have created many different tools that have been taken into account in recent years in the European Union. At European level, we have set the minimum terms and conditions of all Member States and all companies to comply with when considering reduction in jobs, especially in the case of major reductions, or when preparing other decisions that are likely to affect employees. Directives on workers' benchmarks and business transfer and the European Corporate Council of Businesses form our legal framework to protect the rights of employees and ensure a sufficient level of communication and consultation of employees at both national and international level. When looking at the participation of employees at the national and/or local level, the Commission again wants to emphasize the proper information and consultation of employees' representatives before the dismissal is decided or taken, such as the Directive and other national provisions on the mass collapse of the workers. I would remind you that, in principle, violations of these rules will be resolved in national courts if and when national representatives refer them to them. Although corporate management formally follows current rules or arrangements, it does not yet mean that its attitude is socially accepted. For some time, the Commission has been of the opinion that the rules we have drawn up are not sufficient to help them address the current challenges. As the world is constantly changing, and as our problem is great unemployment, we think the forced rules have become old -fashioned because they do not implement or promote key ideas behind our employment strategy and the pursuit of change: anticipation, risks, and employability. For this reason, in November 1998, the Commission proposed a proposal for a directive for employee information and consultation, which later received strong support from you. We thank you for that. Unfortunately, the second branch of legislative power, the Council, is not yet yet after more than a year has begun to deal with it. I hope that this debate is partly reminiscent of the Member States how important and urgent the initiative is. Recently, we heard from Portugal, Presidency, that the proposal will soon be seriously discussed. The future Presidency France also seems to be willing to address this topic urgently, as is reasonable. The Commission sincerely hopes that Parliament and the Council will soon receive this important topic, which we believe will provide a very functional solution for the worrying cases we have now gathered here to deal with. When looking at employees' participation at the international level, there are some indications that, at least in one case, companies may have violated international agreements with their European employees with their European employees. At least they may have exploited a few contradictions in the current legal and contract framework. The Commission will contact the relevant national authorities to review the matter. In any case, I would like to say to those who consider that their rights have been ignored in this context that they have appropriate means to carry out their rights or to receive compensation, inter alia, by bringing an action to the relevant national court.	fi
President, dear colleagues!We have to make an important decision today.Does the European Parliament support the ecological principle of producer responsibility, according to which manufacturers are responsible for old vehicles?In amendment application 38, this question is denied by the Christian Democrats: Car manufacturers and drivers should share the costs closely.This compromise does not apply how the guideline on packaging and packaging waste shows such a cost division.Packaging still creates considerable waste quantities in the European Union, which also represent an environmental impact.Some of the socialists led by Bernd Lange describes this principle as correct, but it is not to be introduced until 2010 or 2012 in accordance with amendment.In the common point of view, there is talk of 2006, which, according to the Greens faction, has more than enough time to prepare the automotive industry.Therefore, I call on my colleagues not to support the amendment application 38 of the Christian Democrats and the amendment submission 45 submitted by some socialists.If the car manufacturers have to bear the cost of recycling their vehicles themselves, they will design them accordingly with regard to their easier and cheaper reuse.The problem of using plastics in cars has been dealt with in the future when PVC is replaced by bio -plastic produced from plants, which is ultimately associated with lower costs for consumers.The majority of this parliament tried for 20 years to enforce European environmental policy even more determined.Under the pressure in particular by the German and French automotive industry, this focus is on being lost today.Therefore, I ask you to vote against the amendments 38 and 45.As a parliamentary group of the Greens, we largely support the common point of view.President!The waste of old vehicles represent one of our really big environmental problems, both with regard to the amount of waste and the emission of environmentally harmful substances.We at the Gue/NGL parliamentary group therefore call for this area as comprehensive and consistent regulations as possible.With this guideline we can take a big step forward.However, this presupposes that the advice of the council at the reading in parliament is not dismantled and weakened.However, some of the amendments submitted would have this effect in the event of their assumption.This applies above all to the PPE faction's amendments, but in my opinion unfortunately there are also some amendments from Mr. Lange.It doesn't take much imagination to imagine that the auto industry of certain countries, e.g.B. Germany, before the acceptance of this guideline, did a strong lobbyism.The admission of the following principles is crucial for us: The polluter of the contamination is subject to payment.After that, the manufacturer has to be full responsibility, i.e.h.also take over the financial, for the recycling of the vehicle.There must also be regulations for vehicles in use.We cannot accept that the advice of the council is weakened to the date of entry into force.The demands for recycling after a certain number of years and the corresponding percentages may not be softened.In addition, the use of dangerous substances such as lead must be restricted.We will vote against all amendments that go in the opposite direction in this regard.	de
This is why, dear colleagues, I ask you to support the amendments deposited by Bernd Lange, which will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists because, in fact, they reconcile all the interests in the presence - Economic interests and environmental constraints - while leaving free Member States of the methods of implementing these constraints, since these amendments provide that the systems in place in the Member States,Work quite well, will be able to continue working.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, the proposal for a directive relating to out -of -use vehicles which occupies us today aims on the one hand to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market in this sector.A word to say that, of course, historic and period vehicles must be excluded from the scope of this directive.The cars, we will all agree on this, I think, are also part of our cultural heritage.That said, one of the stumbling blocks relates to article 12, that is to say the date of application of the directive.The solution proposed by Parliament, namely 18 months after the date of entry into force of this directive, for vehicles put on the market the first time, is unrealistic.The European car fleet has several tens of millions of cars that will have to be taken up without having been designed to be recycled.The common position was more passable since it provided 2006 for vehicles already in circulation.This would also allow businesses to make funds for funds to meet these additional expenses.I will therefore support, in this regard, like my group, the common position which presents a balanced compromise, it seems to me, between the constraints of companies and the essential advanced in the protection of the environment.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the European Parliament is today faced with an important decision.Are we committing ourselves in favor of environmental protection and consumers who are carrying the future or the Parliament accepts, as the Florenz, Lange and others amendments to become the valet of the German automotive industry?The credibility of the Parliament, one of the pioneers of environmental protection, is at stake. It would be more than scandalous than the PE returns to what the governments of the 14 Member States have proposed and the European Commission in matters of producer and environmental protection.The intention underlying the proposals of amendment Florenz and Lange is clear: it is necessary to annihilate this directive.The proposal for shared responsibility should empty its substance the principle of responsibility and undermine any innovation.By drawing many obstacles, they want nothing more than a policy of managing the flows of materials that are effective on the ecological level;Via approaches, they want to delay twelve years or more the implementation of directives.It is completely unacceptable.I therefore launch a particular appeal to German parliamentarians: do not allow today a political disaster.The red-green government coalition was not covered with glory during the debate on the directive on out of use vehicles.	fr
However, let me clarify one thing on behalf of my faction: Social convergence strategies must not be an alternative to social legislation, but can only present a rather useful addition to what we develop and what we expect from the Commission in relation to social legislation.The European Parliament should also try to convince the Council to specify the common strategy in Lisbon and to get an annual procedure to combat poverty at the beginning of 2001.To my delight, the European Parliament is given to this idea of ​​my faction, and hopefully, Ms. Commissioner, we can also expect your support.Finally, we urge that the European Parliament as well as the social partners and the NRO in the social affairs are definitely involved in this process.This strategy should only be successful with a broad, democratic basis, and therefore we hope for your support.Mr President, in November last year, four main goals were decided by the governments of the EU countries that have already been mentioned today: It must be ensured that it is worthwhile to have work and a fixed income that the pensions are safe and the pension systems are sustainable, that the social integration is promoted and that one ensures a sustainable health care system of high quality.These are four goals that are so comprehensively formulated that they can be supported by everyone.And we can only use it if we commission a group of top civil servants with the exchange of experiences to coordinate and evaluate development within social and labor market policy.The communication of the Commission, which we discuss today, was the basis of the Council decision in November and, in a balanced form, represents how the debates can become more qualified, how we can gain more knowledge about the challenges with which Member States are confronted in the area of ​​social policy in the coming years.B. to the increasing aging - and where we will feel the effects of the expansion.There are already major social problems today, and public budgets have to bear high social costs, which is a problem for many Member States.If no reforms are carried out, there is a risk that the financial basis of social policy deteriorates.A strong and competitive economy is the best basis for social security.Therefore, it is reasonable to put these topics on the agenda.In the discussion about the coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression of social convergence.We can support the term social convergence when it comes to designing common general objectives within the EU that the federal states want to meet with their national social policy.So this is not about harmonization, but about common goals.The EU countries organize their social policy in different ways.Our traditions are different, there are differences in our culture, and despite many points of contact, there are also big differences between the countries in terms of the type and scope of social problems.Therefore, it must be emphasized that social policy is a national matter.Social policy must of course adhere to a number of common framework conditions.	de
Therefore, an upper limit for administrative tasks must be set.The committee pulled conclusions from these critical remarks.We placed particular emphasis on linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social area, in tourism and in small and medium -sized companies with the promotion of start -ups in small and medium -sized companies taking into account the necessary economic structural change.The integration of activities as part of the community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a decisive prerequisite for achieving the task of the Equal program.We strongly support the innovative approach of the formation of international development partnerships and the organization of the exchange of experiences at European level as an integrative part of the Equal program.The special goal, the achievement of a European benefit, raises regional cooperation to the European level, while maintaining the cooperation of a wide variety of regional actors.This is a good thing, and that's why we approved it.Mr President, my dear ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues!Today it has already been pointed out that the first urban initiative was clearly successful.The fact that this initiative is now continued within the framework of Urban II, albeit with lower center equipment, we owe only committed members of this parliament, especially - as far as I heard this as a new member of this parliament - also the rapporteur Ms. McCarthy, who I would like to thank for this commitment and of course also for her report on Urban II.New to the Urban II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or districts.This is important because small cities in particular often have worse opportunities to get funding.On the other hand, however, the problems that lead to strong renewal needs can concentrate particularly in such cities and have a strong negative effect.In order to increase the effectiveness of the individual measures, the number of projects for Urban II was limited to 50.I think it is important not to keep this arbitrarily set numerical limitation, but to leave it up to the Member States how many projects they want to divide on the funding they are entitled to.However, it is important to ensure that in small Member States, especially in again, districts of large cities will enjoy the funding.There, Urban II would only be a drop on the hot stone, of doubtful success and dignity.In my opinion, it is also important not to excessively expand the selection criteria for Urban II and thereby water them down.A strictly deliberate criteria catalog in particular is a prerequisite for the funded projects to have a model character and will be transferable to other problem cities in the future.From my own municipal political experience in an old -industrialized region with many problems, I would like to finally ask you, dear colleagues, especially for the support of two points of the report, which I think is essential in addition to the socio -political aspects.First: The aspect of environmental protection is indispensable for sustainable urban development and should therefore be a general prerequisite for project funding.Second: Prevention and combating urban everyday crime and drug procurement crime must start at the local level.They are indispensable to increase the urban quality of life and must therefore also play a central role in the Urban II initiative.	de
On the national level, we believe that the taxation of work and businesses be reduced, to join levels equivalent to those which are used in competing countries of ours, but this question is the responsibility of the Swedish parliament, and not of the European Parliament.The fact that several countries are looking for various solutions in terms of tax policy and social protection gives the possibility of adapting them to national specificities and of testing different social protection systems.Tax harmonization on the scale of Europe should only intervene in exceptional cases, for example for certain taxes related to the environment or relating to capital.We agree to estimate that a certain degree of harmonization is necessary for the internal market to be able to operate, but we believe that amendment 4 goes far too far, and that it is missing by too many nuances.Common resolution on the sinking of the Erika (RC B5-0181/2000) Mr. President, we voted the resolution concerning the sinking of Erika by solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster.However, we denounce the horror of the resolution.To be content to deplore the disaster and complain about its victims, without taking constraint measures to oblige total to repair all the direct and indirect consequences of pollution for which it is entirely responsible, it is nothing to do.It is revolting that Total leaves the volunteers and local authorities to repair the damage he has caused.It is just as revolting as it is the state that unlocks funds, moreover insufficient, which is only a subsidy disguised to this company with criminal actions.To be content to wave only the question of pavilions of complacency is to elude the essential.Whatever the pavilion of convenience that Total uses, the culpable oil company is widely known and present in all the countries of the European Union and the authorities concerned could, if they wanted, put all its goods on sequests until the company pays.And we especially want to denounce this economy where, to make additional profit, a company can pollute a region as it can ruin it by factories.Mr. President, on behalf of the Breton Democratic Union, the Breton partner of the European Free Alliance, and in my personal name, I ask that a real policy be adopted in order to avoid new disasters such as the sinking of the Erika.The regulations and the means of control must not only be stricter, they must also be subject to rigorous application.We clearly made it clear that a series of actors had to make the floor to make sure that the Erika was the last ecological nightmare of the Breton coast.It is already the seventh time that a black tide hits Brittany from the sinking of the Torry Canyon.No other region of the world had to pay such a heavy price to transport polluting or dangerous products by sea.	fr
Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, I would first like to thank and congratulate the rapporteur and also point out that she is not satisfied, in her report, to salute the proposal for a framework decision-making, but that she also offers some modifications that have been highlighted in the various interventions that we have heard, modifications which complete or improve the initial text, but which we cannot all mention in detail.Anyway, it is a question of guaranteeing the success of the Euro.We must therefore do everything in our power so that this success is not threatened or questioned by insufficient protective measures against false coinage - and we are aware of the first attempts in the matter.We have all noted that the transition phase generates many uncertainties and dangers.In addition to the work accomplished against falsifications, and the regular execution of the provisions, the information campaign planned must therefore play an essential role.We still have to devote ourselves intensively.These are also cooperation issues.We need a definition of specific skills of the ECB, national central banks, the commission as well as Europol for everything related to the falsification of the euro.I also wonder if it should not be created an interinstitutional or community organization responsible for ensuring coordination in terms of cooperation.In this regard, we are also talking about setting up an early alert system that would work 24 hours a day and to erect a common information system allowing a rapid exchange of information between the various competent authorities.In addition to this report, whose content we greet, it remains to clarify many questions.I hope that the debate we hold here will provide some of these clarifications.Mr. President, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, to what extent is the euro a safe currency?This is a question that is very frequently asked by the population.This question will of course be asked in a more and more pressing way as we approach 01.01.2002, the date on which the Euro will be found in all the wallets.This question relating to the security of the euro does not only concern the stability and external value of this currency, but also its protection against false coinage.These are questions that also affect the population, because this money will be, as has just been said, a novelty for the citizens of the Union, both for the eyes and for the hands that will manipulate them.The fact that this currency will be valid on a much larger territory and will be used as the main currency throughout Europe will also be a novelty for European citizens.We will have to get used to it.It is therefore clear that we are asked the question in order to know what the EU undertakes to protect the euro from the counterfeiters.This is what we debate during this night session.It is truly a subject that is closely interested in the citizen.It is therefore regrettable that he was discussed at such a late hour.But it must be so.Obviously, the European Central Bank has been seized of this issue for a very long time.	fr
At the time of globalization, even if we want to accompany it with a framework of clear rules that provide guarantees to economic operators and consumers, the European Commission cannot forget solidarity, emphasizing its achievement, using all its riches and comparing its needs. We come from a story where we were taught that politics must have a heart. We hope that the White Bible, its actions and the committee will show it in practice.) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, the formation of the new Europe is an ambitious goal for both the committee and for all of us. Our aspirations and our work will be monitored by the citizens of our countries, but also by many other than our Europe and our Union. So what will be the picture that this public opinion will be formed and the rest of the world for this five -year program? My answer is that this is a new beginning, a clearly reformist agenda, which confirms the desire of the Union of 2000 not to remain at the level of an economic union, but to be a union with values ​​that we deal with seriously. The Commission is justifiably stating that the pursuit of the Union in the age of globalization is the development and protection of a prosperous society inspired by solidarity, a fair and more effective Europe, which sees, from the view of solidarity and the enlightened benefit of its own benefit,as the worst enemies of peace and freedom. Being in line with what my teammates mentioned and applauding the dominant tone of your document, I would like to draw attention to two shortcomings that need to be corrected as we continue our work. The first concerns women, gender or rights of the woman. You referred to women's involvement in increasing production and growth. This is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also for democracy in our societies. That is why it is striking that the word equality, gender or woman, in general, is not mentioned anywhere in the context of the formation of the new Europe. You referred to your speech to the woman, but this word is nowhere to be strategic to strategic goals. Is this, Mr. Commissioner, because the incorporation of the principle of equality has already been implemented in the Commission to such an extent that women do not need to be mentioned? How else do you explain this absence of women? The EU should not be transformed into a union with a male face. My second question concerns Africa, which is also not mentioned in the context of the formation of the new Europe, while all other continents are mentioned. In Africa lies the largest number of refugees in the world, the world's largest poverty is concentrated and the destroying AIDS epidemic. I know that Commissioner Nielson, like others, do a good job, but it is necessary to focus the attention of the whole committee on this continent, and in relation to its strategic goals. Finally, I would like to welcome the Commission's announcement as well as the fact that it is stated for the first time that the EU intends to take unilateral measures that will help developing countries have increased access to our markets.	el
What was it suggested by Mr. George Katoffis, who then retired from the exhibition? It presented us with an ambitious exhibition, where it promoted an optimistic Europe, which sought to chart quantitatively identified goals in view of the results we expect to achieve. And it is well known that Europe has always moved forward when it was quantitatively identified. Why was the report withdrawing from the report, for example, the proposal that the active population of Europe should reach 75% of the total population, while today the corresponding levels are around 60%? A percentage of active population of 60% is very low compared to that of Japan or the United States, and we are not able to produce as much as the aforementioned countries with such a low employment rate. So we need to increase the employment rate by creating competitive jobs. As it was pointed out in the run -up to the Lisbon Summit, we need to draw up workforce with scientific education to respond to new technologies. And we need to accelerate the rates of investment growth. The perception of colleague Von Wogau, according to which the flexibility of the workforce is, is an argument that has been heard many times. In this argument I would like to contrast the example of Portugal, where labor law does not include flexible provisions and where, however, the unemployment rate is less than 5% - and in recent years it has been steadily declining - because investments are increasing (thanks to Community support, of course). For this reason, what we want is a Europe that will grow economic growth, but which will also take care of social aspects. Mr President, I would like, like many others, to thank Mr. Katoforis for his interesting report. By reading the report and seeing the image of the European economy as described in the report, I have the impression that this image is extremely alarming. Investment levels are too low, unemployment continues to be too high and growth is inadequate. For this reason, it is no strange that the euro is still losing ground compared to other coins, although it is said that the European Central Bank maintains the euro market in secret. The rapporteur finds that stability is not an end in itself, which I agree with. There is a lot of talk about stability, convergence and coordination and minimal for factors that contribute to innovation and development. In my opinion, EMU is a huge colossus that difficult to keep up with with the extremely motor economy. My conclusions are, however, completely different from the conclusions of the previous speakers. I believe that we need to invest in human resources, partly through a macropolitan that creates demand and new work opportunities and partly - and perhaps most importantly - through investment in actions for professional life, such as training, democratization of businesses and good social conditions, and in this field. That is, we cannot, as another baron just a bare bonus, raise economies in Europe from above.	el
I am referring, Mr President, at point 38 and points 41 and 42 of the Haarder exhibition. With point 38, which was negatively restricted by the amendment no.22, and re -formulated in the room today, an attempt is made to impose it in Italy - who knows why only in Italy - not the separation between judicial and political power, as Montesquieu has taught us, but the separation, in the context of the judiciary, between the judicial and judicial sector. The final destination of this irrational logic is that anyone who, as in Italy, today, belongs to the judicial authority as an investigative power, will then end up depending on executive power, at the real danger - which is certain - investigations against corruption, against abuses of political power. Referring to points 41 and 42 I express my assent to the fact that no citizen, nor the male descendants of the former kings, can deprive freedom to enter their territory, but I cannot understand why this should only concern Italy and Austria:Most of all, in terms of Italy, the determination of a period not over six months, in which sanctions will be applied, I consider to be opposed to the Italian Constitution, which provides exactly a constitutional resolution. Mr President, annual reports on human rights, racism and xenophobia are the best reason for a critical treatment of our states within the European Union, or rather the best reason for self -criticism. From this they could actually learn a lot of some of the candidate countries, as well as their Members - here I think some of the Turkish Parliament MPs. They can learn, for example, how independently the people of the people have to act and have to act when it comes to human rights in their home country. We must confess, however, that we still have a lot to do. Self -criticism is not enough. It honors us but it is not enough to confine ourselves to it. When in our reports we condemn cases of torture and violence to arrested or detainees by class forces or prison staff, we must admit that so far, very few things have been done by those responsible to combat this phenomenon. The same is true of certain samples of behavior towards refugees in some Union states. How long will we still discuss prison conditions as a problem that is well known but not yet regulated? When the point is to regain the people who are in prison institutions for society, then we must admit that European penitentiary institutions are currently completely inappropriate to perform this duty. We are justified in criticizing human rights violations and discrimination in the candidate countries, e.g.in Turkey or in some Eastern European countries, when it comes to Roma or other minorities. However, especially for the reason, this should be exemplary when it comes to human rights in the European Union.	el
"This report is basically a basic text that is inspired by the law of the jungle, because competition cannot solve any of the problems of mankind at the turn of this century. Unlimited competition is a factor that causes recession and insecurity, both in terms of biosphere, culture promotion and cooperation with third countries. Do you think 18 million unemployed in Europe are probably victims of too cautious pursuit of competition policy? We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state subsidies are in principle too large. What iron -to -iron rule, which efficiency criteria would it be? Do you still seriously recommend that WTO be expanded after Seattle? Only a lawyer advisors for multinational companies can demonstrate such stubbornness. Jonckheer's report (A5-0087/1999).(FR) I am pleased with the quality of the seventh overview of the European Union's State Aid, the review of the annual review, and that the Directors responsible for the competition provides general and case -specific information to citizens on its website. I am pleased with the rapporteur's way of dealing with state aid and congratulations him. Too often, state subsidies are condemned as distorting measures. Of course, effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and the financial and monetary union. But as rapporteur emphasizes, state subsidies are sometimes essential and can not only help companies cope but also promote sustainable development (Article 6 of the establishment), non -profit services (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). However, it is clear that they need to be monitored, which is the task of the European Commission. The total subsidies granted by the Member States of the Union in these sectors were EUR 95 billion between 1995 and 1997, and the production industry accounted for about 40 % of this amount. Subsidies have decreased significantly to the previous period, 1993-1995, (in the total subsidy sector, the reduction is 13 % and in the sector of the manufacturing industry from 3.8 % to 2.6 %). This decrease is primarily due to the reduction of support granted to new German states. Like the rapporteur, I find it unfortunate that the figures presented in the report do not cover all state aid. The European Commission must correct these shortcomings as soon as possible. It must also cooperate with the Member States to improve the quality of the information in a timely manner, ie before the ninth overview. It would be good if the Commission would publish a list that contains the total number of State aids granted by a Member State. I also regret the fact that the European Parliament has been completely excluded from the State aid advisory committee. In order to balance the situation, the European Commission must prepare and present the reports regularly to us. Finally, I will look at an aspect of the use of state subsidies, which I think is very dangerous: these are the subsidies that encourage the transfer of a business from one Member State to another, which can lead to a ""subsidy"" in companies that do not promote the common EU goals in any way. For this reason, I hope that the future report on State aid will include an assessment of the effects of such subsidies on employment and the industry's industry and craft industry. Langen report (A5-0073/1999).(FR) In the morning, I talked about the Langen text on the application of sixth steel rules in an important competition in an important competition. As has been recognized by the court in its order on May 3, 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition disruption. Therefore, it was justified to create a support system for the sector, which aims to ensure that effective companies survive, even though Article 4 (c) of the ECT is prohibited by state aid for the steel industry. This is the goal of the sixth steel industry support rules. At the same time, of course, the deterioration of competitive conditions and the serious disruption of market balance must be avoided, for which these subsidies need to be regulated. State aid must therefore continue to be limited to research and development support, environmental aid and the dismantling allowance. Similarly, it is very important that Member States fulfill their obligation to notify the Commission of the subsidies granted to the steel companies, as provided in Article 7 of these rules."	fi
According to this, there seem to be adjustments everywhere, but many of these adjustments, and most of them look downward, while the rest are improved. Most of these adjustments are pensions, ie 11 restrictive adjustments and two improvers. As far as unemployment benefits are concerned, 6 restrictive adjustments and 5 improvers are found. Causes for these adjustments are e.g. Improving employment opportunities, reducing social security costs, but also the policy of competition and the criteria of EMU. We are mainly found in the states of the North, while most of the stabilization and improvement of social security adjustments are found mainly in the states of the South. However, we generally see a limited role for social partners in the whole process. This does not seem particularly enjoyable and means that the convergence strategy should be directed to the best approaches. Cappuccino coffee, to use this expression, is not always good for us. Nl) Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the committee and the rapporteur. The Commission because it took a new step towards convergence of social security and the rapporteur for the satisfactory report he wrote. The European Union's policy, in addition to economic and employment policy, includes social policy. This has so far been limited, both in terms of organization and the media. But under the influence of the free movement of workers, the internal market and the euro, the labor markets are completed. This has inevitable consequences for social security, which is largely related to work. Cross -border workers, posted workers, immigrant workers, but also those looking for work, practitioners and students are prevented from exploiting the right to free traffic, due to lack of coordination and convergence in social security. The same phenomenon is observed in the field of taxation. In order to combat the distortions of competition and to avoid dumping, the Commission has developed a balanced, in my opinion, approach, which is between harmonization and non -intervention. On the one hand, the rules for similar salaries or full pensions are binding and inalienable, and on the other hand, programs are used to motivate discrimination or social exclusion. Based on a series of recommendations, reports and announcements, the Commission has proceeded in the direction of convergence, on the one hand by setting goals and on the other hand with the posting of a group of high -ranking employees for this purpose. These two proposals have already been accepted by the Council, and now the issue of supporting this approach is raised, so that we can judge in time, knowing the cases and/or to what extent and how social protection should be revised in the European Union. This is because enlargement, globalization, aging population, personalization and family changes make an analogous revision inevitable. Failure to recognize these situations actually means rejection of social protection. To Eurosceptics and nationalists I would like to point out that social protection exclusively within the borders of a Member State is not social and does not provide the slightest protection, because the dissolution of social protection for the benefit of competition harm social protection as a productive factor.	el
And this is where the paradox is.The convergence of political and monetary Europe inevitably leads to the convergence of the rules of the labor markets of labor and social protection.At the same time, however, the single currency, combined with the lack of employment mobility and a redistributive tax policy, forces us to do the non-convergence of wages and social protection to compensate for the differences in productivity between countries and regions.It is not hypocrisy and beautiful words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernization and consultation that will get us out of these contradictions.Or the European Union becomes an authentic federal state, with real redistributive taxation, real mobility of employment and therefore, and from this moment only, with common rules in terms of employment and social protection, or it is better not to make vain promises and not to make illusions on the impossible pathways of convergence, a principle that sounds well, but which causes harm, especially to the most deprived.We would do well to become aware of it.Mr. President, unlike some of my colleagues intervened in today's debate, I tend to approve the Andersson report, among others because I see very clear differences in relation to the Commission's communications.I am notably aware that this report defends the solidarity approach to the European social model - and I want to congratulate the rapporteur for this.I would like to emphasize clear positions against social dumping, as well as the right to minimal social protection, the objective of social convergence and, more particularly, on what is very concretely mentioned in terms of equal opportunities and objectives of social policy.I also note the shortcomings with regard to insufficiently coherent consideration of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, a policy which hinders this joint-joint owner of the European social model.Overall, however, I consider this positive report.Mr. President, I speak to speak, by reaffirming it, of the need to modernize social protection more as an instrument than as one more step towards European construction.This is how Mr. Andersson's report underlines, which seems excellent to me.Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in the economic and political field, will become a lame, weak and limited, perhaps short, if we do not manage to make it strong in the social field.I think that this last point implies employment possibilities for those who ask for it and a firm action in favor of socially lower people.Considering that anyone has the right to social protection and a guaranteed minimum social income, I think that we must not forget the case of those who were not born within the European Union.Remember that in 1999, 717,000 people came to compensate for our low birth rate.This is why, in social order, an immigration policy endowed with social conscience is absolutely necessary, as the Gutierres president recently declared it in Spain.	fr
Finally, the Commissioner, we cannot forget that there are still major economic sectors which are still strongly in the public domain, which go from public televisions to be funded by taxpayers or from postal services to certain compulsory insurance, including insurance-maladie and social insurance, managed by ineffective public monopolies which offer no salvation to members.The commissioner, I know perfectly the constraints of the treaties, but I believe that it is important here to repeat that the European economy suffers from American competition, also and above all because of the lack of openness and competition.What we do now is probably very important but it is still insufficient.Mr. President, by definition, a white paper is not to be taken or to leave, but is intended to arouse reactions.From this point of view, the white paper is a success.It represents a good basis for discussion and it is therefore necessary to give it a good welcome.I understand what were the views of the authors at the beginning of their study and I join them.I also start from the principle that you, the Commissioner, want to honor your reputation, as well as to the work accomplished by your predecessors, and that your services also share the same objective.I cannot imagine that the Commission could take initiatives which would have the result to deviate from European integration and renationalize.However, I make concern for myself and I ask myself questions.I first question myself about the coherent application of politics.I am generally an ardent supporter of cultural diversity but not in terms of the culture of competition in the domestic market.The internal market needs a competition policy that is uniform, not only in its concept, but also in its implementation.European regulations are certainly enacted and communications as to their interpretation are actually transmitted.The Commission should also have a right of evocation and it should indicate guidelines to the national authorities in charge of competition.However, I wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in an Echternach procession, where for two steps forward, we make one back each time.I would therefore like to learn a little more about the way in which the commission intends to guarantee in practice the uniform application of the proposed policy and if you consider that the tracks described from point hundred of the white paper can be followed in a realistic way.Secondly, I understand the concerns of businesses about legal certainty.Many files are precisely introduced from this perspective.However, this instrument will disappear in the future.Do you say in the White Paper that the Commission will issue some individual provisions which will be able to serve as guidelines, but what will be your criteria to sometimes grant and sometimes refuse such specific developments?Thirdly, I want to know if the Commission examined what would be the consequences of its new approach to business strategy.I worried in particular as to the fate of small and medium -sized enterprises that will lose part of the legal and economic protection they have, as is the case with the new exemption by category in the distribution sector.	fr
A5-0037/2000, of Mrs Attwooll, on behalf of the Fisheries Committee, regarding the proposal of the Council, regarding the financial involvement of the Community in the costs of the Member States for data collection, as well as the financing of studies and experimental projects to support Common Fisheries Policy (1999) 551999/0224 (CNS)).((()) Both proposals on a Council Regulation on the collection and management of fisheries data and on a Council's decision to finance this issue are particularly welcome. The same is true of the joint discussion on them, because each can be fully understood only in combination with the other. I know that their pregnancy took about five years. With the revision of the common fishing policy foreseen in 2002, it is important to make rapid progress. If we first take the proposal on a Council Regulation, we will see that it provides that Member States must collect a wider range of fishing data than needed under the previous regulations. These data include both biological and financial information. The proposal also provides for the creation of such data from the Member States in consolidated form. What new data are to be collected and which of them and existing data are to be unified will be determined by an application regulation. The application regulation will determine a minimum and an extensive Community program. It seems that these programs will not cover the whole range of possible elements, but will be selective, for example, by type of fishing stock. The proposal for a Council's decision enables the Community's financial participation to participate in the Member States participating in the collection and management of data. It also provides the Commission itself the opportunity to finance studies and experimental projects. The only sanction for Member States that do not fully fulfill the requirements of the minimum program under the regulation is that it will not be a candidate for any financial support for the extensive program. The committee examined two basic issues of reflection in relation to the proposal. The first concerns the degree of participation of the Commission. The initial proposal simply provided the possibility of transmitting to international organizations of information gathered. In this case, the Commission simply received a copy of the information transmitted, if it requested it. But as the community funded this process, it was considered appropriate to have an immediate return on its investment. Consequently, the amendment no.6, while maintaining the freedom of the Member States to transmit the data to international organizations, it also requires that they also be sent once a year to the Commission. This change was made in conjunction with the amendments no.1.4 and 7. The amendment no.1 clarifies the point that although the data are to be scientifically documented, their collection is for broader decision -making purposes. The amendment no.4 makes it clear that the aim of the process is to evaluate fishing resources in general. The amendment no.7 calls on the Commission to submit annual reports on how he used the information collected under the Rules of Procedure.	el
We have to make the effort to start flowing into the Kosovo area and generally throughout the Balkan area after the warlords have left there. So it is right to say that financial assistance is really an important part of the opportunities that are created for those who work in Kosovo themselves. I agree with the declaration by Doris Pack here and emphasize that members of our European Parliament must adhere to our responsibility in this matter, though we naturally require the same. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good members of the Parliament, I would like to start to thank the report rapporteur, colleague Brook, warmly for his report. If the Council had worked as quickly as a colleague Brok, we would really be much longer. The neglect of the Council is indeed regrettable! The rapporteur and his report are properly taken as their starting point that we must and have to be helped quickly, but they also justify that we do not provide relief and not arbitrarily. In this context, I would like to refer in particular to the revision proposal 5, which is very clear that exceptional financial assistance funds can and can only be funded by Kosovo's budget needs arising from public, semi -public, municipal or other governing bodies and institutions directly or indirectly. We need to be clear, a member of the Commission that we support the unMIMM and the institutions set by the united nations, especially the fourth pillars, and it cannot happen that we support the developed and still existing parallel structures in Kosovo. What should this money do? I would like to refer in particular to human rights. The West has fought in Kosovo for human rights. What is happening in Kosovo now? Serbi's extensive expulsion activities could be stopped, but almost daily there are condemning cases when people are killed and prevented from life in the area and life as they want to live. Attacks on Serbs, Roma and Bosnians are everyday, but Albanians are still attacked. The report actually struck me when it was stated that an albanic doctor who was likely to have had a great deal of difficulty while working in a hospital in Mitrovica's Serbiosa, eventually giving up his help in this hospital because his life was repeatedly threatened. These are cases and situations that we cannot digest. I have heard - whether it is true or not, I do not know - that Serbs still maintain a mine in the Kosovo Serbiosa. There are at least rumors that the Serbian militia still works actively. It is secondary to me whether it is a Serb, Roma, a Bosnian or an alban that is threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is secondary to me who is trying to share and separate Kosovo. The decisive thing to me is that the bodies we fund achieve what we want to achieve, namely the multinational and parallel Kosovo. We need more cops because they are not available in nearly enough. We need an independent judiciary - which is quite difficult to create - and we also need funds for the Commissioner responsible for human rights. All of this has to happen and even quickly. If we do not give help quickly, the situation will get worse and new conflicts and crisis situations can arise. That is why I think it is right that we have worked fast, recognized the urgency of help and we grant the funds needed for it. However, we want to see deeds and we also want to see positive results in Kosovo, and I ask the Commission to ensure that these funds are also successfully used, especially for the development of police forces and the construction of the judiciary. Mr President, firstly many thanks to Parliament members, and especially the rapporteur for dealing with this issue so quickly.	fi
However, many believe that, if we look at the situation realistically, we cannot honestly oppose an agreement like the one that concerns us today; mainly, because we believe that it will objectively create the conditions for greater development and democracy and because, in addition, the agreement itself includes a suspension of human rights. On the other hand, I believe that surveillance measures can be introduced to demonstrate the results it produces at all levels, not only at the level of tariff change, etc. I am more concerned with what Mr Sanchez said here: that we sign an agreement that can not be implemented in practice, because there are not sufficient resources and services for example, or which will produce the opposite results, because we have not provided funding to companies. Therefore, let us take all these actions and be vigilant to avoid what we want to avoid: the continuation of human rights violations. Es) Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Mrs. Ferrer for her excellent work and also state that this time, unfortunately, we cannot vote for her, even though it is a good job. This decision has nothing to do with the effort made, but to the situation in Mexico. For three weeks, I met in Madrid with President Zedillo and expressed our concern about the news we received about human rights violations in Mexico, the situation at the University and the situation in the municipalities of the indigenous population of Chiapas and other communities. Mr Zedillo promised to provide me with complete information to prove to me that our concerns were unfounded. The days have passed and, however, this information has not arrived by Mr Zedillo, while receiving information from many sources that suggest that there is still a serious state of human rights violations in many places, which intensifies our concerns. We fully understand the improvements involved in the financial provisions of the agreement, but also in this direction, we believe that we have not been able to displace - as it was in our intention - the enormous importance of North American influence which, as Libra, exerts its pressure on Mexico and other countries. Therefore, as we have come to consultations with the left-wing parties of Mexico on how to vote- and we decided to abstain- this time we cannot even abstain, because I believe that we have to give it an indication of the Mexican government;The fulfillment of San Andrias' commitments and the restoration of democratic normalcy, just as the democratic clause sets..(PT) Mr President, I am not going to talk about the content of this Agreement, since various colleagues and the rapporteur itself had already had the opportunity to refer to it. However, I would like to draw your attention to an aspect of political significance: I am referring to the conclusion of this free transaction agreement between the European Union and Mexico. First of all, from a strategic and political point of view, it is important for the European Union to develop relations with a country that has such weight in the particular region of the globe, and mainly with a country that has made progress in its commitment to human rights values. As soon as she was mentioned to the OECD. It would also be advisable to remind you of its accession to the Council of Europe in the capacity of observer.	el
First, every European port has to build reasonable port ripens for ship waste if he does not yet have it.So there must be them.Second, all ships, regardless of their flag, have to dispose of their waste.Third: The costs must be borne by the ship.We agree on that.We want to reach a system together to avoid that there is economic incentives to pour the waste into the sea.Firstly, we want to protect flora and fauna and secondly there are many coasts where tourists are happy and jobs are to be created on the one hand.That means we want to have an effective system.Where do we differ from the council, apart from little things that we want to exclude the museum ships from the bureaucratic regulations, and that we are a bit strict with large fishing ships and sports boats?The really decisive difference is the question, how do you load the disposal costs to the ship?The colleague Bouwman has already explained it.There are two experiences: one in the Baltic Sea area, and this is not a national experience, but the experience of the entire Baltic Sea area, and which says that if you cover a large part of the disposal costs over the general port fees, there is no incentive to dispose of the ship's waste in the sea.If you have already paid the disposal, you can also dispose of in the harbor.The other system is the pure cause principle: if you base ship waste, you have to pay extra.This second system has proven to be ineffective because why is the Mediterranean so dirty?Why is the North Sea so dirty?Because the cause principle does not work due to a lack of reasonable controls!That is why the committee said with a lot of majority -no majority, the representatives of the minority opinion will comment -as the parliament in the first reading, without any dispute, without any dispute that the No Special Fee system is the better system, because it offers the ships of economic incentive, so to speak, not to pour the crap into sea, but to dispose of it in reasonable harbor fishing systems.That is the crucial question.We are ready to agree with the council.But the Council has so far rejected every serious agreement with us.Therefore, I appeal to the house, our application, according to which essential parts of up to 90 % must be covered by the general port fees.Because then we have the opportunity to agree with the Council in the mediation committee procedure, be it 75 % or whatever.Therefore my request to the Commission: Mrs. Vice President, be careful which page you stand on!I think in the interest of environmental protection, a long -term, flourishing tourism industry in many countries in our community, it is better to have an effective system.Therefore, support our NO Special Fee system.Perhaps we will then achieve a reasonable compromise with the council in the placement process.President!I am pleased that you are leading this debate, I know that as a Bayer you always give the ports and the oceans an open ear, and I would like to thank the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, for the work he did and also for working with us in the run -up to tomorrow.	de
How do you describe it?What is a recognized minority?Regarding the political decision, I would also like to ask who makes the political decision.Is it the commission?Is it the advice?To what extent can the European Parliament be able to play a role in this process?What is the role of scientific committees?And what will be the next role of the food authorities that you are going to put in place?Finally, this decision-making will be made in a transparent and public manner?These are my three questions.Yes, Mr. President, that's right.There have been many complex subjects that were not always absolute clarity, but I will try to answer certain questions.Who will make the decision?Who are political decision -makers?Well, it depends on the legislators.This is part of risk management.They must take into account, for example, citizens' concerns about a particular subject, and they must form an opinion on the basis of scientific evidence in a specific case.But it is true that the use of the precautionary principle does not depend on the vast majority of the scientific community.It can be used on the basis of evidence from a minority or when science is not complete.Of course, this is where we establish a balance between this principle as a political instrument and science.It is not always easy to precisely describe the course of this process, but there is no question of changing the scientific base.We consult the experts in order to bring together as much information and facts as possible before making a decision, and this is what we will also have to do in the future.You must consider this as a risk management tool.You must choose: Either you put citizens in danger, for example, or you want to protect the environment, and you must take into account the available science.You have to assess all of this and assess science.Then you decide whether or not to take a measure, whether or not to undertake an action.So there is no answer to all your questions, but that does not change the scientist system or the expert system that we use today.Mr. President, I have a question in relation to a concrete and current case, in which the precautionary principle could apply.It concerns the delayers of flame in bromine.It is a fact that these substances are now detected;We discover growing concentrations in men and in the environment.Many claim the fact that they have significant risks, while others question the importance of the risks linked to these substances.Recently, Sweden and Denmark have urged the Commission through the Council of Ministers to take an initiative in order to prohibit the delayers of flame in Brome.I therefore ask myself the question of whether you are preparing such a ban and if taking such an initiative would not be suitable very well, in your eyes, to the precautionary principle itself.	fr
"This applies in the area of ​​globalization.Globalization enables a higher increase in assets, an increase in international trade and productivity.However, the deregulated globalization, as it exists today, or globalization, in the broad circles of the world population, do not benefit extensive investments in people, is also a factor of exclusion, division and the widening of the trench between rich and poor.This applies in the knowledge society that pave the way for a new equal opportunities, but also an increasingly sharp separation between those who have access to it, and that can accuse those who are denied access, as is the case with the relationships between the old and the new economy.Incidentally, it is not the first time that a technological transition takes place that changes the paradigm of society and the business organization.In such profound transition phases, the problems, especially the employment problems of the old economy, are solved through the use of the new economy and its instruments.I give an example: in Europe we have a textile industry.We must also have a textile industry in Europe in the future, but this will only be the case if we can use the technologies of the information and knowledge society there.It is noteworthy that it is currently missing in the sectors of the so -called ""new economy"" eight -hundred thousand specialists for existing jobs, while there are millions of unemployed.This means that we have not yet been able to take advantage of the instrument of the new economy in order to solve the problems of the old economy that will never find a solution within the structure of this old economy.In conclusion, I would like to answer a question that I have been asked, namely whether I speak here in the name of fifteen or fourteen countries.The answer is simple: I speak in the name of fifteen countries.The unreserved participation of Austria in the work of all Union institutions is part of what the Portuguese presidency guarantees.What the Portuguese government - and certainly also many other governments in Europe - does not prevent it from fighting against a single country, but to defend the principles and values.Incidentally, principles and values ​​that existed before such political movements as the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats.I speak of the principles and values ​​of the era of the Enlightenment, which includes confirmation of the primacy of reason.If modern societies have an enemy today, then they are irrational political behaviors.This irrationality can be called political populism, or excessive nationalism, religious fundamentalism, racism or xenophobia.This is a central question: Without the confirmation of these values, there can be economy and employment, but no Europe., Commission.(IT) Mr. President, Prime Minister, allow me some very short comments to conclude this long, but extremely constructive and important pronunciation.First, we don't start at zero.All those who might consider our statements to be exaggerated to understand that we do not start at zero.Europe can rely on the advantages of the common currency, the advantages of the internal market."	de
"And more than that, and that is more prose, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous political initiatives by converting them into new programs that are comprehensive and comprehensive and to benefit our creative industry to the extent that they need now.It proves mobility and opens up access to culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded.What I regret is of course the fact that when it comes to carrying out this program, we do not have a means of the extent that our ambitions require this and it would be necessary for implementation.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen, we arrived at the end of a long way.After the brokerage phase, our institutions can now formally adopt the new ""Culture 2000"" supporting program.This means that we have a well -suited instrument and clearly structured measures with which we will successfully develop the area of ​​culture in the next five years - I am sure.I am happy about this happy ending and I would like to thank you for it.I would like to thank all members of the parliament who have contributed to a good conclusion.I would particularly like to thank the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport and, above all, the rapporteur, Mr. Graça Moura, and the chairman, Mr. Gargani;Likewise, the delegation of the European Parliament, those responsible for the factions as well as the committee committee and its chairman, Mr. Imbeni.Everyone has made constructive, balanced and decisive amounts, which proved to be great help throughout the procedure.I would like to add that the difficult, sometimes very exhausting negotiations have been completed in record time.We now have a supporting program, the first of this kind in the field of culture.This program gives us the opportunity to set new starting points and to promote the culture of global but also more comprehensive and stronger.How she is happy about these positive results, which, despite an center equipment that does not do justice to the goals, will make it possible for us to tackle the future positively, and I would like to take up what the chairman, Mr. Gargani, has just taken up: The Commission has given a statement in connection with the half -time assessment.She explained that, as part of the report to be submitted in accordance with Article 7, the decision to be submitted in accordance with Article 7 of the decision of Parliament and the Council.This includes checking the funds as part of the community's financial preview;If necessary, the report will contain a proposal to change the decision - and all until June 30, 2002. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal obligation that is not just on paper.All of this must lead us to strengthen our actions in favor of a community cultural area within which our cultures can develop better with their special characteristics and differences, but can also enrich each other - and the other European citizens can participate in this.The influence of parliament is also thanks to the fact that more smaller projects are intended in the immediate vicinity of the citizens than large, spectacular actions.This has the result that the ""Culture 2000"" program becomes a program of the citizens."	de
However, the Environment Committee approved two major amendments, which I express my satisfaction, even if, in my opinion, it is not enough. To tell the truth, I believe that it is an unacceptable compromise and that we have generalized the use of vegetable fats without providing adequate information to consumers, ignoring the problem of the unreliable method of analysis, abolishing the auxiliary and responding to theThe right of consumers and the future of millions of cocoa producer farmers. I am specifically referring to West African cocoa producers, which exceed ten million and the future of which are openly at stake. You will ask me why I say this at a time when an annex is proposed in the common position that seems to be facing the problem. There is indeed an annex that limits to six the list of approved vegetable fats, including Kariti butter, a vegetable edible product collected by the population of some poor African countries, including Mali and Burkina. Unfortunately this restriction does not provide all the guarantees for the future. On the one hand, it is indeed possible to make equivalents of the cocoa butter without the Kariti, and I do not doubt that we turn to such solutions for the cost of cost and reliability. On the other hand, various industrial processes, chemicals or genetic engineering, allow the preparation of the cocoa butter from a cheap basic substance included between the six approved: from palm oil derived from industrial crops and the price of which may be ten times lower than the market. Contrarying Kariti's butter producers, who are worthy of our attention to cocoa producers who promote vegetable fats, with the support of the European Commission, which I express my great regret, conceal a reality that I consider to be a reality thatIts present form is its multinational chocolate, whose aim is to increase their profits preferably low -price vegetable fats and increasing pressure to reduce cocoa price. That is why I believe that some amendments submitted on the initiative of colleagues of various political groups, especially MPs Thomas-Muro, Ries and Isler BiGuin, can restore the position taken by parliament first and give more value to the text. I will specifically mention the compulsory indication on the main aspect of the product of the presence of vegetable fats, the requirement to precede the validity of the validity of a reliable method of analysis, the principle of supplementary, which was abolished by the Council, although it was initially proposed by the Commission, the rejectionRejection of the use of genetic engineering methods - and finally one last but equally important proposal, a serious study to evaluate the impact - not after long after the position of the Directive, despite being in force - to the socio -economic status of the Cocoa producers' countries.	el
Many protest voters, who have long wanted a change in Austrian policy, have surely mobilized too.I am of the opinion that parliament must support these democratic forces.I also appeal to the Austrian president so that he still examines all the possibilities of forming a government made up of democratic forces.Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would simply like to insist on the value of an attitude like that which the president of our group, Mr. Francis Wurtz, recalled recently.I appreciate the declarations of the chairmanship of the Council and the position of the fourteen countries which have refused to establish official contacts with the Austrian government if the party of Jörg Haider participates in it.It is all the more important to emphasize this that, as everyone knows, we depict the political lines defined by this Europe substantially, as economic and social policies, the deficit of democracy, the involvement of these same countries in the dramatic War of the Balkans.This dissenting highlights our approval today: an exceptional element, because the danger of a renaissance in Europe of an irrational and neonazia component is also exceptional.This danger does not only concern Austria, but Europe too.We are talking about ourselves, not Austria.We are aware of the social causes which contribute, with unemployment and uncertainty, to feed such propensions.We know the cultural reasons - xenophobic, racist - but we cannot ignore the inability and the refusal of these far -right forces to cut bridges with Nazism and the possibility of creating an explosive mixture in Europe.Let's talk about the Alpine Arc, let's talk about all our countries: conditions allowing an resurgence of a danger to European democracy and civilization are currently put in place.In its position, the presidency was aware of this drama of civilization.Europe proves that it has not forgotten Auschwitz, Europe has a soul.Today, it should however be substantial in its actions, and the commission should be the first to be.Unfortunately, it has shown here opacity and fragility which even more affirm the value of the position of the presidency.This is the correction to be made to the action of the commission.Madam President, dear colleagues, faced with the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and freedom and sovereignty of peoples against any form, new or old, fascism, Nazism or communism, and since all previous speakers have spoken of sovereignty of the Austrian people, we see today this sovereignty denied by the European Parliament itself.It does not appear from reading the program of the Austrian liberal-democratic party, no element that could justify the accusations of attack on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law consecrated by article 6 of the treaties.On the contrary, I would like to remind colleagues that the President in office, who is so critical of Austria, recently placed the inhabitants of Macao under the sovereignty of democratic People's Republic of China.	fr
We must ensure that the main road to protect rights is through national courts and through a control jurisdiction such as the one currently exercised at European level. If we do not succeed in it, then we will fail in everything. Contracts are of course relating to relations between states and citizens, and, since the EU is not a state, it is a problem that it is behaving and gaining more and more state responsibilities. This is how a gap is created in terms of fundamental rights, a gap that must of course be filled. But in our enthusiasm to achieve things, we are in danger of causing great damage. The EU is in front of a dilemma. Will we safeguard our own rights, limit ourselves to ourselves and our home or enhance human rights throughout Europe? The EU should not become a competitor to existing dispute resolution principles, such as the court for human rights based here in Strasbourg. This would weaken it, which would damage the situation of human rights across Europe. In my notion, therefore, the Court of Justice of the European Communities must remain outside the fundamental rights program. On the contrary, the EU would have to take seriously the decisions of Strasbourg and demand today's and future Member States to ratify the European Convention on Human Rights, International Labor Organization Conventions (ILO) and UN Conditions, but also as a requirement for the UN.partners to these contracts. In this way the EU will strengthen existing contracts. That's exactly what we need. I would also like my colleagues to express my congratulations to the two rapporteurs, despite the fact that I do not agree with everything they present and propose. At the same time, they were assigned the impossible task of attempting to square a circle that was not square. In my short time at my disposal I would like to focus my attention on a specific topic mentioned by the previous speaker, as well as other speakers. This is the possible conflict that may arise, a conflict between this map and the European Convention on Human Rights. Let us not forget that every Member State has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights, incorporated it into its national law and is bound by the decisions of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. In the last fifty years, the European Convention, with court rulings, has expanded and evolved to cover new rights and new freedoms that have been developed with society. Also, if the Members do not know it, according to a strict legal interpretation, any Community legislation displaces all the constitutional provisions or other national legislation in any Member State. Therefore, if this map is incorporated into the conditions, it will displace the European Convention on Human Rights, displace all national constitutional provisions and also displace all national legislation.	el
Unfortunately, the impairment of an effective ecological material flow policy was successful, namely demanding a mandatory assessment of the dangers of substances that have been known to be harmful to health for years. We know that lead, mercury, cadmium and six -valuable chrome are very toxic and very dangerous to health, and many community directives have succeeded in restricting their use without assessing their dangers. Unfortunately, the European Parliament in this case was bent in front of the industrial interests. However, I am very pleased that there were no majority behind Florenz, Langen and other checks, which truly tried to eliminate the manufacturer's responsibility and leave the cost of paying the environmentally friendly dismantling of scrap vehicles only to consumers. I considered that company very shameful and I was delighted that it was not successful that the company of the Government of the Big Member State and the members of the parliamentary parliamentary members from the Great Member State to manage the voting behavior of the European Parliament due to the interests of their own industrial interests. The Mr President, even though I spent most of my life in fast cars, I agree with my colleague Florenz that the scrap car directive must clearly highlight that museum cars are not covered by the Directive. These fine cars are not waste. That's why I voted for the checks. Also, the age of museum cars should not be defined as there are very large differences in national regulations. This will allow historically valuable vehicles to remain for future generations. Nor can we forget about old car enthusiasts, who have over 50,000 in Finland alone. They do quiet but very valuable cultural and historical work. The handling of this issue in Parliament has been at least confusing. In the plenary session before the vote, new revision proposals have already been rejected in the committee voting. In this contradictory situation, we believe that the council's formulas are the best. We need a directive for this area and therefore want to avoid a complex mediation procedure. The Directive on scrap vehicles becomes an example of future legislation. Therefore, it is important that the producer's responsibility is clear;It must not be endangered in any way. The Parliament deals with this document for the last time today, which concerns scrapping vehicles and their fate: the scrapping, which is an environmentally commendable intention. However, there are two things in this text, which must be paid attention to. First, compensation for scrapping. We have to make sure that the payer is not always the same person, that is, the owner of the car. He already pays enough taxes on his car, which is only a bottomless money hole from an economic point of view. Recently, we have been able to talk about the pollutant to pay principle, so let's apply it rationally and calmly, without ideology and keeping the goal in mind. Another important thing that needs to be included in this text is that cars with a collectible value are clearly excluded from its scope. Of course, it can be said that it is not necessary to record this in the text because it is self -evident, but I still want this to be recorded, as it is really important that only clear texts are accepted. So let's vote for these checks so that we can protect these treasures of the automotive industry. These old vehicles are evidence of a culture and a passionate hobby that must be recognized and respectable in Europe so that our originality cannot be impaired. There are many examples of this in the texts of the community, which can be used to see how vagueness and inaccuracy contribute to the emergence of great controversy and debates. I only mention Directives number 79/409 and 92/43 as examples. The punctuality of texts means certainty and legal protection for those who apply this text on a daily basis or to whom it is relevant to daily life. It is not the job of members of the European Parliament to create conflicts or to organize lawsuits, no matter what these members are, because they would not fulfill their job.	fi
In the new agreement, both sides commit a responsible state leadership that is considered a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, and a regular dialogue will take place in an area that the community actively promotes.Second, a new procedure was created to treat violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law.Compared to the current approach, the responsibility of the state in question is given a stronger weighting in the new procedure, and the consultation process is more flexible in order to be able to lead an effective dialogue about the measures to improve the situation.In particularly urgent cases in which there is a serious violation of one of these essential elements, measures are immediately initiated, about which the other party is informed.Third, the EU and the AKP have agreed on a new, special procedure for serious corruption cases.This is a real innovation, both in the context of the EU/AKP agreements and generally in international relationships.This procedure is not only used in corruption cases that deal with EEF money, but also in a further framework in all countries in which the EU provides financial support, and in which corruption hinders development.The procedure is therefore not limited to EU activities.This is an extremely important aspect in which the funding of public finances is taken into account.By accepting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the AKP countries jointly set a clear and positive signal, which will certainly be recognized by the European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors.Another new area in the agreement between the AKP countries and the EU is immigration.We have concluded a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area.This new dimension of the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines for which the EU advocates the contract of Amsterdam and the conclusions of the European Council in Finnish Tampere in October 1999.The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy based on the principle of partnership with the countries of origin and regions.The agreement concluded with the AKP countries prepares the way for new initiatives, especially with regard to the rights of nationals of third countries within the EU, and for measures to facilitate integration.We have agreed on regulations related to illegal immigration.The EU and the AKP countries will be determined within a framework that is to be negotiated with each individual AKP state, the possibilities and instruments for the return of illegal immigrants to the relevant countries.This also includes people from third countries and stateless people.With these extremely innovative approaches, the manner of the government can be improved.The agreement also creates a good framework for stabilizing the mutual reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid.We have agreed to include negotiations on new trade agreements to liberalize trade between the parties and to develop regulations on the regulation of trade issues.With regard to the temporal framework for the trade negotiations, we have taken into account the wishes of the AKP countries.Negotiations are started in 2002 at the latest.This two-year preparation phase is to be used to strengthen the regional integration processes and the ability of the AKP countries to manage trade negotiations.	de
We share with all the residents of the Basque Country the suffering our people have experienced. We are committed to dialogue and are ready to work with all those who are looking for a democratic solution to the Basque Country. It has been 20 years since the issue of Northern Ireland was first raised in this Parliament. May I ask: Quousque Tandem - Noiiz Arte? Mr President, thank you for the speech I received. It's really hard for me to speak after the speech I just heard. When my colleague Alonso Puerta listed the names of the victims of Etan, he did not mention that he did not mention it to respect a person who killed ETA 16 years ago. He was a senator and also a member of the Basque Parliament, and his name was Enrique Casas.(Strong applause) Mr President, Senator Enrique Casas, was my spouse. I was widowed with four children, the youngest of whom was eight months old. The only thing my husband was guilty of He was a Basque Senator born in Andalusia, which the Basque government had sent to Madrid to defend the Basque Country to defend the Basque Country, but above all a democrat, only a democrat. Mr President, I've never talked about this here in Parliament. Only when ETA declared the ceasefire, I received it with satisfaction because it meant hope for the whole Basque people and Spain and Europe as a whole. It's the only time I've talked about this. Today, however, I have to talk and I do it straight from my heart. Mr President, I was born in Germany, went to my school in Sweden and married a Spanish. I know what democracy is because I have had the privilege to grow in a country like Sweden that has a long tradition in democracy. I arrived in the Basque Country and sincerely wanted to adapt to society, and despite what has happened to me, I am still convinced that one day the Basque Country achieves the peace of mind, for those who think that in the Basque Country is conflict, I say that the only conflict in the Basque Country is to end. Other things can then be discussed.(Strong and long -standing applause) Other things We Democrats solve all the thoughts, for there is freedom of expression in the Basque country, there is freedom, there is freedom. The only thing that limits this freedom is ETA. Eta must be lost and the democrats must make their voice heard.(Strong applause) I thank you, Member Dührkop Dührkop, and show you my heartfelt respect. Approval of the Protocol of the previous session The minutes of the previous session are divided. Is there any comment? We are about to discuss the Commission's reform, and the Mr President, you remember that at the beginning of the previous session, I asked you the question of whether, for transparency and transparency, members' financial interests should be easier to be available to the public to publish it on the Internet. You promised to Parliament that you would deal with the matter with the customers that night. After all, you could now tell the Parliament that the Qstorms have reached a fundamental agreement that the list should be published on the Internet, and if so, could you set a date for maybe 1 April, by which time they should be done. I can say to you, a good colleague that the Presidential Welfare made a decision that a list of members' financial interests will be published on the Internet and that the role of the Quivers is to investigate very carefully about the legal issues related to this decision. However, we will get the decision very soon.(Protocol was approved.) Commission's reform on the agenda is the next Commission's communication on the reform of the European Commission. I will give an immediate speech to the Commission chairman, Romano Prod..(IT) Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, last July I gave me my solemn commitment to the renewal of the Commission.	fi
"It simply authorizes the commission to do so if it wishes.As has already been said, the council decision proposal is divided into two parts.The first concerns the financing of Member States to apply community programs.The second part is to authorize the Commission itself to finance studies and pilot projects.There are a few minor amendments: Amendment 2 aims to guarantee that the financial contribution in favor of the Member States can cover not only the data collection costs but also the costs of management, compilation, aggregation, etc.Amendments 3 and 6 are intended to soften the calendar since the Member States will have to wait for the implementation of the application regulations to find out what programs really involve; they also aim to align the calendar with dates and regulations.Amendments 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is regularly transmitted to the budgetary authorities.More significantly, the Fisheries Commission, within the framework of amendment 1, accepts the recommendation of the budget commission according to which the financing should be entered in post 1 (b) rather than at post 3 of the financial prospects.Although in its preliminary draft budget, the Commission has registered credits in post 3 ""internal policies"", the Parliament has created a new B1-500 budget line to finance the measures during discussion.This provides security, to ensure that the necessary resources continue to be available.Mr. President, I think we all have to agree with the assertion of Ms. Attwooll at the start of her excellent report according to which these two proposals from the Commission, aimed at better understanding the scientific and socio-economic situation in the fishing sector, arrive at a critical moment.The exhaustive collection of the data that is proposed and their appropriate processing will be essential elements to discuss with more rigor the revision of the common fishing policy.This - obviously - if the data is ultimately obtained.Because, as our rapporteur also rightly points out, the Commission's proposal has no compulsory nature for the Member States.The sending or not of the data is completely voluntary, and their non -presentation would only mean the loss of a certain economic compensation, which, moreover, is not very high either.Given our experience in terms of data presentation in the fishing sector - and I get back to reports on the implementation of pop - I think that instead of having a complete table of the situation in this sector, we will end up with a confused panorama, in which Member States will provide, for example, scientific data, but not those relating to employment, while others will communicate those on employment, but not to -get them and transmit them.And, of course, I am afraid that some prefer to give up financing, if it allows them to continue to hide their mismanagement, to which we have already attended in cases where the sending of said data was compulsory, as in the case of pop."	fr
Consequently, the Commission first supports the amendment no.16, however, prefers to formulate amendments no.19;However, we know that if the unlimited duration was approved here, then we would inevitably drive the conciliation process. In this context, we believe that the duration of the seven years proposed by the Council is sufficient, and therefore to avoid the conciliation process we do not support the amendment no.18, which provides for the unlimited duration of the Regulation. The last major issue, which is common to both the regulation and the forest regulation, is the amendments related to bank guarantees. We agree with Parliament's view that the Commission should not set bureaucratic obstacles to the access of some NGOs to Community resources funding. For this reason, the Commission decided in July 1999 to require bank guarantees only for advances in excess of € 1 million. Consequently, the problem has, in large part, resolved. In addition, the Commission considers that such issues are addressed in the most positive way through the horizontal approach, rather than through specific regulations. For these reasons, the Commission does not support the proposed amendment no.10 for bank guarantees. The other amendments to the Environment Regulation can be placed in two categories: on the one hand, the amendments consisting of the recasting of data in the field of the proposed act or its means of intervention, and on the other hand, the amendments related to the management of actions to be funded, and in particular the fiscal aspects. Regarding these two types of amendments, the position of the Commission is as follows: aiming to find a compromise solution to avoid the conciliation process, the Commission may support amendments no.1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, although he considers to offer little added value to the total text. Careful reading of the common position will demonstrate that most concerns these amendments have been taken into account, but according to the structure of the regulation. The second type of amendments causes more problems in the Commission, which therefore does not support them: amendment no.9 - For coordination with the domestic partners, as stated in the report - it is not supported by the Commission, not because of disagreement in principle, but because this article is part of the treaty referring only to coordination with the Member States. The amendment no.12 proposes the increase of EUR 2 million to EUR 5 million of the marginal amount to submit plans for examination by the Council. Since most plans are already less than € 2 million, this amendment is considered non -relevant. In addition, we are concerned that its approval could lead to a conciliation process. As a result, the Commission does not support it. Amendments for commissions and access to markets - amendments no.13 and 14 - would constitute a deviation from established and carefully agreed formalities.	el
As for that, I have nothing to say. But the essential issue we need to take here is this: We have a Europe that has gained giant steps in terms of economics, the single market, the single currency, but where nothing or almost nothing happened in the areas of security and justice. We remain in a framework of security and justice that has almost entirely national characteristics, at the same time that reality is clearly evolving into transnational contexts. And we are constantly confronted with this contradiction, in particular with regard to the rights of the child, an area where there are cases involving more than one country and where the victims, beyond the fact that they are not informed by the state where the trial is being carried out, also do not enjoy judicial assistance. Mr President of the Council I would like to thank you, unequivocally for the last hour of the questions you have found that no violations of Articles 6 and 7 have been noted in Austria and that it is a precautionary conviction. My question refers to the ad-hoc decision of the prime ministers. Here are bilateral sanctions that have been decided by the exclusion of the Ministers of Foreign Affairs and the Parliament of the Member States of Europe. All EU institutions were overcome and found before events. Therefore, my question: How will things evolve in the future, leaving aside the case of Austria? Is it in the future for the Prime Ministers of national parliaments to condemn European states? Are there eight votes here or will different majorities need? To what extent do the European Council and the European Institutions lose their power and their potential to shape situations through it? Is there a new kind of competition between European institutions and nation -states in this case? Mr Paulo Casaca, let me tell you that I am not so pessimistic about how the European Union has evolved towards shaping a moral dimension, and in particular in the direction of acquiring legal bodies that will give it the opportunity to afford it. I think it is important to keep in mind the fact that, in the context of developments introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will be transfers of responsibilities and there will, over the next five years, be a process of transferring responsibilities on which the issues that were included in the third pillar would pass through the first pillar. This procedure will mainly concern the issue of visas, judicial cooperation on civil affairs and customs cooperation. The third pillar will continue to be included in the issues related to judicial cooperation on criminal cases and police cooperation, but at this moment we are making efforts to establish a space for freedom, security and justice, where we expect the Commission to meet the Commission through the Commission. On the other hand, I would like to point out that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is in the process of discussions, may most likely be an element of empowerment of these new dimensions and will undoubtedly contribute to endow the European Union with a solid and stable set -	el
"As I had the opportunity to say, the Commission is aware of its share of responsibility.In this context, it brings a final touch to a first draft proposal for an evaluation panel, a scoreboard, so that all the institutions and the other parties concerned can evaluate the progress made in the implementation of the necessary measures and in compliance with the deadlines set by the Amsterdam Treaty, the Vienna Action Plan and the conclusions of the Tampere European Council.This evaluation panel will not be a simple legislative programming instrument, but also and above all an instrument for strengthening transparency and responsibility for all European institutions to citizens.Because it is for citizens that we set up the space of freedom, security and justice.The progress recorded will be due not to the Commission, the Council or even to the European Parliament, but rather to the Association of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, insofar as, as has been said here, determined tasks of the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity.In the coming weeks, I will carry out a tour of the capitals in order to probe the opinion of the Ministers of Justice and Interior Affairs.I intend to debate this scoreboard project with the European Parliament and civil society.We intend to present the final version to the ""Justice and Internal Affairs"" council, under the Portuguese presidency, after the consultations that I have just mentioned.My intention is to make this scoreboard a political and strategic orientation instrument for all institutions, but also an examination of examination on the part of public opinion.I therefore recognize - and this is a challenge to which we are all faced with - the need to develop a communication strategy that allows the general public to perceive what is the effective added value of the Union in everyday life, in these areas so essential to citizenship, respect for legality and, basically, of democracy itself.Beyond the scoreboard, I would like to say that the Commission intends to present the following initiatives, during the year 2000, and I would like to emphasize here that I welcome that the Portuguese presidency considers the development of this space as one of the priorities of its work program.I hope it will be possible, with the Portuguese presidency, to work clearly in a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which also constitutes the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be followed by the subsequent presidencies.With regard to immigration and the right of asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for the development of a community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees;Start the analysis of the criteria and conditions for improving the implementation of the Dublin Convention and the possible amendment of its legal basis, in accordance with the Amsterdam Treaty;Continue the debate from the communication already carried out on the rules leading to a process of asylum common to the whole Union;And present proposals for the development of legislation providing for the granting of residence permits for victims of the trafficking in human beings who cooperate with justice against trafficking networks."	fr
Mr President, I would like to say the following about the explanations of the Council and the European Commission: I see how sensitive you, Mr. President, approach this topic and what efforts to contact the Turkish-Cypric side.Perhaps it would be clearer and correct, even if the vocabulary used by them would not be doubted that they in no way have an - however given - indirect recognition in mind, even if they emphasized that this would not be possible under any circumstances.For example, I would not speak of the government in Nicosia.This is the Cypriot government, Mr. President, not the government in Nicosia.This government has proposed a mode of how the Turkish-Cypric side can be involved.The Council and the Commission should now urge the Turkish-Cypric side of being institutionally integrated into the framework of the negotiations that are undertaken by the Republic of Cyprus.On the other hand, the way in which the question of leaving the protocols and the approach strategy has so far aroused some doubts.I cannot understand why an exception should be made for these two small countries, why there are conflicts between the organs or why the parliament had to exert pressure so that the funds are transferred to Chapter 7 for the approach strategy.Is it really possible that the European Union treats two small countries on the edge of the Union in such a way that it needs on the one hand, but on the other hand, which on the other hand also bring all the prerequisites to become full-fledged members of the EU and which could actually already join the Economic and Monetary Union?I agree with the commissioner that this is a political decision, a political decision that should not be too difficult, Mr. President, if one considerations consider the enormous advantages, but above all the support so that the two community forms a state again so that there is a substantial extension - there has already been a first approach between the two communities - and finally frees the republicbecomes.President, venerated colleagues, as part of the hearing procedure, we today deal with a proposal for a regulation of the Council on the implementation of measures regarding the approach strategy for Cyprus and Malta.This proposal is comparable to the one that has already been submitted to other accession countries, and after its implementation, he will replace the recently expired financial protocol.The instruments for introducing are intended to represent a technical and financial contribution to the efforts of the accession countries to meet the requirements of the Acquis Communautaire.The review by the Commission has shown that Cyprus and Malta - although these countries are counted by the World Bank to the states with high incomes - encounter the same difficulties in the implementation of community law as the Moel, due to their insufficient capacity of the administrations and courts.On the occasion of the examination of Mr. Brok's excellent report in the committee, it was pointed out that these two countries can also enjoy the Meda household line for horizontal measures for horizontal measures.I ask the Commissioner for express confirmation of this point.	de
Gender equality, which affects the very life of women, and therefore society in general, is equality in work, both equality in work access - which requires equality in training - as well as equality in remuneration for the same work, which we have so many times supported. We are convinced that women's involvement in the decision -making process will be for the benefit of society as a whole. Women have always contributed to a visa different of these men, which serves to enrich and supplement the overall point of view of the best solutions to the problems of daily life, the resolution of which people who, as we do, are devoted to active politics. However, the difficulty consists of finding the appropriate solution, which allows for greater presence of women in responsible positions, and consequently in decision -making. In some countries in the European Union, a compulsory percentage of participation, which directly ensures a more balanced presence of women, have been legally established by law. Nevertheless, it is not the best solution, because there is not always a sufficient number of women available to enter an adverse, competitive world that they consider primarily male -dominated, since it traditionally belonged to men. Women's participation in political parties is not fifty percent, nor in the field of work and society. It is much lower, and this is the involvement of the base we would have to promote to facilitate the presence of women. There must also be a clear and real will to have more women capable and willing to take responsibility and obligations in political life, that is, in the decision -making process. There is no clear agreement in the European People's Party team on supporting the compulsory participation rate. Some even oppose. Personally, I would not want to feel percentage, to think that I am in a certain position because of the fact that I was born a woman. This is a feeling that men will never have and a significant difference. Mr President, I would also like to thank the Council President and the Commissioner for their good speeches, which I consider to be a trigger for real optimism, especially given the will and commitment, which both ladies have expressed. I believe that the example given by the Commissioner was excellent when he said that the question would never be asked if the 15 Member States could not be represented equally, but the same is not true of the equal representation of women. The point cannot be more clearly not raised, because it is exactly about it. So I hope that the Commissioner - of course is new and dynamic - will have the necessary perseverance to perform the necessary reforms in the committee. I am convinced that this issue will be a difficult job. If the Commissioner requests the support of Parliament, he may in any case account for the support of the Liberal Team. We are interested in the maximum that there is equality in the Commission, to ensure the necessary bases for decision making so that the Commissioner can pass on his views on equality.	el

Thank you.(The President declares the common position approved as modified) Report (A5-0033/2000) of Mr. Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication of the Commission relating to a concerted strategy to modernize social protection (COM (1999) 347) - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182 (COS)) (Parliament adopts the resolution)This concludes the vote.Explanations to vote- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) I salute the quality and the ambition of this report relating to Life.I will briefly remind you that Life is a financial instrument at the service of environmental policies within the European Union as in third countries, that it acts from neighboring Mediterranean countries, the Baltic Sea countries or countries candidates for membership.The Commission of Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, has proposed many amendments which, for the most part, have been retained in the common position adopted by the Council.For the third stage of Life (2000-2004), this instrument will be divided into three axes entitled Life-Nature (47 %of resources), Life-Environnement (47 %) and Life-Pays Third (6 %).In my opinion, the most important changes focus on: Life's contribution to sustainable development in the community, as well as to the development of community policy in the field of the environment, in particular with regard to the integration of the environment into other policies, and to update as well as to update the environmental legislation;Improving efficiency, transparency and methodology of Life implementation procedures, information and dissemination procedures with the public and cooperation procedures between beneficiaries;Life's objective: this must mainly aim for sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the Urban initiative, on which I had the opportunity to express myself elsewhere;The contribution of projects supported to the sustainability of socio-economic activities, and therefore to the creation of jobs.What seems essential to me is that the Life instrument will remain open to the participation of the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe.The other candidate countries (ex: Cyprus, Türkiye, Malta) will also be able to participate in Life when agreements allowing this participation will be concluded with these countries.	fr
We have submitted a communication on joint asylum procedures and a decision -making recommendation authorizing the Commission to negotiate with Iceland and Norway an agreement intended to extend to these two countries the rules applied to the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention.The Commission actively contributed to the work of the high -level group on immigration and the right of asylum.Finally, in December, the Commission presented a proposal for the creation of the European Refugees Fund.In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for settlement with a view to the communitarization of certain agreements: one on judicial cooperation and the execution of decisions in civil and commercial matters, (Brussels I);Another relating to the competence, recognition and execution of decisions in matrimonial matters (Brussels II) and yet another concerning the summons and notification of judicial and extrajudicial acts in civil and commercial matters.We presented, still in 1999, a communication on the victims of crime in the Union, by starting a reflection born of Tampere and by demanding the development of minimum standards on the protection of victims of crime, especially on their access to justice and their rights to the compensation for the prejudices suffered, including legal costs.I will also mention the presentation of the decision -making project on the fight against fraud and falsification of means of payment other than species.In the field of the Union's legislative framework, with regard to the fight against financial crime, the Commission presented a project to revise the money laundering directive.In 1999, we attended the entry into office of Europol.After what was asserted here by the Portuguese presidency, with the new cycle in the fields of justice and internal affairs, the start of the reflection relating to the implementation of the new skills attributed to Europol by the Treaty of Amsterdam, we sincerely hope that it will be possible to discuss in the same way with the Commission with regard to the question of democratic control and the articulation between Europol and the relevant judicial instances.In 1999, the Commission presented its contribution to a European action plan in the fight against drugs, which is the basis of the strategy adopted by the Helsinki European Council.This list of non -exhaustive actions allows me to reaffirm today before the presidency of the Council and the deputies, with great conviction, that if 1999 was the year of the consolidation of the action of the Union in this fundamental field, it will also have been the beginning of a new phase of acceleration of the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice.The year 2000 will undoubtedly be the year of truth for the European institutions and the way in which they will be able to meet the requirements of citizens in terms of guarantee of freedom of movement, in compliance with rights and the guarantee of security and stability, thanks to adequate judicial protection.This amounts to saying that the year 2000 will be for the Council, the Parliament and the Commission, a test year of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to contribute to the foundations of an extended political union for the next decade.	fr
And less social protection means lower purchasing power, less healthy workers and less happy workers. To the hyper -European I would like to say that a European social protection is neither strong nor desirable. Differences between Member States are particularly important in terms of the provisions, beneficiaries, revenue or allowances, etc. Therefore, a simulation is impossible. The road followed by the committee is shown. It has the advantage of clarity, data concentration and exchange of views on the agreement on the objectives followed, the establishment of serious comparative indicators and the possibility of issuing recommendations. I support this idea. I support the committee for this and I hope that at the Lisbon Top Summit there will be another step. Mr President, or Andersson report contains many interesting things. Unfortunately, however, what is more interesting is that the report, which is supposed to process a comprehensive strategy for modernizing social policy, on the contrary, proposes the expansion of traditional social policy and a greater degree of transnationalism in the social sector. Social policy has to be renewed so that unemployment can be reduced in the Member States. Even though the Socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, are much less to unemployment than in the past, this unemployment is, however, scary high, and even though there is an international recovery. There must be something so that unemployment does not turn the so -called European model into a parody. Social policy must facilitate employment and motivate both employers and employees to increase employment. In the Andersson report there is the demand of social convergence, that is, the increasingly assimilation of systems within and through the EU. The EU should truly establish, as reported, convergence criteria, which will be binding and effective. Mr Andersson also wishes to create an effective and ambitious tax coordination, that is, the transnationalism, in the field of taxation. The EU should also undergo a single determination of the thresholds of poverty, to make recommendations on the so -called acceptable minimum level of living in the Member States. The EU should chart quality lines on the quality of jobs that will be created, whatever that means. Unemployment will not, of course, reduce with all these additional arrangements and interventions. Structural problems that are the reason for the fact that unemployment in Europe is greater than in the US will worsen even further. It does not need supranationalism in this area. Member States can shape their own systems in the social sector, each within the framework of its economic resources and political choices, which is crucial so as not to create unnecessary problems in view of the EU enlargement. Mr Andersson considers that there should be a reminder to the poor countries of the Eastern European countries. These. It is, however, obvious that these countries that, within a communist economic system, have been led to poverty, cannot pursue a social policy such as e.g. That of Sweden.	el
This paper is a farce!A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what is specified here in paper form so that in blatant contradiction is what is actually.Such a paper is not a basis for a scoreboard at all.It was advertised and celebrated as the great achievement, but I stand by needing a basis for a scoreboard.We as a parliament want to deal seriously on the basis of a program with future development in this policy area.What we expect are minimum standards in the asylum procedures to get a quick help for refugees, but also to create clarity for those who are not on the run.We want instruments for avoiding abuse.We want to develop a community immigration policy, which of course also includes the ability to integrate the Member States, and we need the expansion of the operational tasks of Europol, for example, in order to take a very concrete measures against combating organized crime.We deal with these tasks seriously and very intensively, and we can also expect this from the Commission, even if it is only about the submission of papers!Ms. President, Mr Commission President, Dear Commissioner, dear colleagues!I take the word to address the topic of world trade organization, an area in which there is no matches between the papers of the Commission and the positions of the parliamentary group of the Social Democratic Party of Europe, which, as already mentioned, is not the case in other sectors.There is an agreement of the views because we are for the worldwide trade exchange.We are for this exchange, but above all for the creation of common regulations, common regulations with which this world trade can be regulated on a goal: This trade should serve the development and in particular a harmonious development, in which the values ​​of citizens not only belong to the most dynamic and competitive regions in the world.On the other hand, what do we find with this remark about the principles?That this regulation and these norms at the level of the world trade organization for a greater trade exchange, i.e.h.have led to greater wealth.However, if we look at the indices of the distribution of this wealth, we unfortunately recognize that the gap between the richest blocks and countries in the world and the poorest and the least developed countries is still becoming ever deeper.Therefore, it would be legitimate and imperative that we ask ourselves what use the current common norms, the current common regulations.What value do the current negotiations, as they take place, and the current way of working of the world trade organization, if this increases the exchange of trade, but on the other hand, dysfunctions are caused and this gap between the rich and poor countries is growing further?That is why we said that we support the strategy here by the Commission for the Negotiations in Seattle and for upcoming discussions.Above all, we are for this strategic vision, but courage and boldness are required.On the one hand, for the impending negotiations on the inclusion of social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection must be imposed.	de
With this, your concerns, Ms. Peijs, should be at least a little scattered.(En) As for Mr. Evans's reference to the effects on the economy, a corresponding cost-benefit analysis should really be taken seriously.Finally, the publication of the white book serves to record reactions from companies and other sources.We have received numerous excellent information and information that offers us sufficient material for a cost-benefit rating for the economy.Before we submit a legislative proposal for a new regulation, we will very carefully check the entire material.As far as the effects on companies are concerned, one thing is particularly important that was addressed by Ms. Thyssen, Ms. Peijs and Mrs. Palacio Vallelersundi, and that affects the SME.This was underlined by many of my previous speakers.The legal certainty of the SME is particularly important to the Commission.We propose a system that significantly increases legal certainty for SMEs.How come?Is it just a political gesture?No.We propose to reform the material-legal regulations in such a way that most SMEs fall under the group exemption, similar to the vertical restrictions on competition.Most SMEs have only one market share of less than 30 %anyway.We have a de-minimis notification with the determination that SMEs usually do not fall under the strict prohibition in accordance with Article 81 (1), since they do not take a dominant position.We work on other group exemptions and guidelines that take the special position of SMEs into account.Our white book about the modernization will also improve the location of the SMEs, firstly by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the current registration system and secondly by introducing the direct applicability of Article 81 (3), which should be particularly advantageous for SME.(It) Fourthly legal certainty: Legal certainty, Mr. Evans, is undoubtedly - and I am the first to recognize this - important to the companies and not only for the legal professions, which nevertheless fulfill an extremely important role in the European structure.Legal certainty is important for the companies: The importance of this topic was also given by the chairman of the committee for law and internal market, Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi - which I would like to thank that, as always, in a wide sense, in the present case, in relation to the competition - they underlined in their last explanations.In my conviction, the present proposal will mean greater legal certainty for companies, for three reasons: Due to the direct effect of Article 81 (3), it will enable the approval of all competitive agreements that meet the exceptional conditions.He will create the possibility of helping companies in the event of doubts in the interpretation of the publication of justified statements;At the same time, this determines exemptions and guidelines to clarify the rules and to ensure their security.(Fr) Ms. Thyssen also addressed the question of legal exception for Justitarians.I just want to remind you that the Court of Justice, as you certainly know better than I do, made a decision on this question in 1982.This case law is still valid and there is no reason to question it.	de
The free recovery system, for example, of old vehicles and the increase in the percentage to recycle will increase as much the recycling activities and the number of jobs it generates.So, for the consumer, for the environment, for the new jobs to be created in recycling, it is absolutely not necessary to amend the common position of the council which is, in the current state, completely acceptable.Mr. President, like many others in this enclosure, I think it's a good measure.It is a useful measure that we all need.Most technical questions have been resolved.Some details must still be settled, but most technical questions have been resolved.We come to the final question.During the first reading, only the economic and monetary commission asked this question and I was the only one, as a rapporteur for the opinion of this commission, to ask the question in Parliament, that simply pays?Thanks to the common position of the council, a reasonable compromise has been reached, in the sense that the manufacturers should pay a significant share of the costs and not all, as Mr. Bowis said in an erroneous manner.In fact - and it is the lawyers who tell us - they should not pay more than 20 % or a fifth of the costs, which is not unreasonable.For example, consider consumers to the United Kingdom who buy a rover, as said Mr. Lange, or, in this case, any other British car brand and who, for years, pay an excessive price for these cars, higher than the price in other parts of Europe, why should they pay?They have already paid.Why should taxpayers or future car buyers pay again to get rid of the vehicle thanks to which the manufacturer has made profits?I cannot accept it.Some amendments offer it.I cannot accept it and I will vote against.Regarding these cars, the responsibility is the responsibility of the manufacturer.It is the manufacturer who must provide the infrastructure and assume a reasonable part of the elimination cost.The common position does not exclude the possibility of contributions made by the government.The common position constitutes a reasonable compromise.Certain amendments offered today are completely unreasonable in the sense that they unload the car manufacturers of the responsibility to pay even a small part of the cost of eliminating cars on the road.I cannot accept it and on behalf of the taxpayers and consumers of Europe, I vote against these amendments.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, everyone agrees to say that we must think about how to treat vehicles out of use in Europe, but, in this case, the Council has not given an example of a judicious European environmental policy.The way in which the German presidency of the Council dealt with this theme was blameless.First, Mr. Trittin, the Minister of the Environment, did not conduct sufficient consultation within his cabinet;Then, the Federal Chancellor, Mr. Schröder, immersed himself in this procedure, like an elephant in a porcelain store, without knowing the file.	fr
I support the enlargement of the Aegean, but this cannot happen until the EU's basic institutions, including the Commission, the Council and of course Parliament, reform their internal decision -making mechanisms. As a Member of Parliament in the constituency of the Connaught Ulster Irish, located in the EU region, I strongly believe in the actual and tangible representation of the smaller Member States in the context of EU structures. At present the five largest Member States hold two positions in the European community. Whatever the reform, it is vital to maintain the right of the smaller Member States to appoint a member of the Commission. Undoubtedly, the European Council, which represents the fifteen governments, must reform its structures. From Ireland's perspective, I strongly believe that the governments of the Member States must have the right to veto for tax changes at the EU level. At the moment they cannot be agreed at Community changes regarding tax arrangements without the unanimous support of all EU Member States. I believe that this is important. In my home country the tax system has innovated in many ways. The tax burdens of medium -sized and lower income workers are steadily decreasing, while significant tax reliefs are given to encourage businesses. This cannot be said about many of the other Member States. Any proposal to give the European Council the opportunity to decide by a special majority for justice and domestic affairs I believe would be very uninvited. In summary, I would like to express my great satisfaction with the president's report this morning to fishing. He said that in his opinion he was lagging behind - that there should be substantial progress in 2002, because fishing is the main employment in areas where there are no alternative sectors of employment. We, of course, want to ensure that by 2002 countries most tested by the introduction of common fishing policy in 1983 will have their share in the future from a fair and impartial distribution of resources. In summary, I would like to point out that at the broader level the EU as an entity should not be left behind in the worldwide search for opportunities through e -commerce. The Commission must support educational and educational programs to ensure that business structures take into account the opportunities that the Internet can offer and e -commerce in general. A revolution in information technology is just around the corner, and we cannot remain inactive during these changes. We must lead our business communities and our educational institutions, so that initiatives in the field of information technology can be integrated into all the basic social and economic areas of our society. Mr President, Mr. Prodi's committee will not last five years, because people will find in short that they are receiving detailed orders from Brussels. It is difficult to say who will cause the explosion that will lead to consolidation and when.	el
But this issue still needs a lot of processing. Mr President, I would like to start congratulating the rapporteur Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf on his report. It reflects the views and concerns of all EU citizens in the field of safety and quality of food. The events of the last two years have certainly led to awareness and concern about the real threat to food safety and public health. The immediate action taken by parliament must be considered by all citizens the greatest guarantee of the future because you have drawn up a program on the quality of food that all Member States must comply with. But even in this critical area of ​​administration, Parliament expresses its commitment to subsidiaryness, encouraging Member States to take responsibility. On the agenda 2000, we gave my view priority to policies directly related to citizens: food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development. If we continue this plan with commitment and diligence, the first years of the new millennium will be a milestone in terms of the implementation of politicians aimed at people and which largely reflect the needs of the community. I particularly welcome the new and rigorous license procedures proposed for additional materials in animal nutrition. Those who have been found to violate these procedures must be tackled rigor. I congratulate the new Commissioner who is responsible for food safety, Mr. Byrne. He has undertaken a tedious task, but has quickly and effectively reacting to the requirements of this body as well as to consumer concern. I am particularly pleased with the fact that my homeland, Ireland, is at the forefront of the implementation of new food regulations based on the principle of detection. This will make the Ireland island in the future for the production of food production. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent work, and above all to express my satisfaction with this unanimity that dominated the policy level on the subject discussed. It is therefore envisaged for the Commission to replace, through regulation, licenses that are currently in force with licenses linked to the registrars of the additional materials, a replacement that will be carried out simultaneously for all additional materials subject to the relevant provisions. A coherent legal framework must be established. The Commission has proposed to introduce a legal basis in October 1999 in Directive 70/524/EEC on the replacement of licenses. However, we must ensure that competition distortions are not created, as Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi pointed out. I also find it necessary to clearly determine the genetically modified additives in feed to allow and ensure that the end consumer can choose a forth -based or bodily -based animal feed. The consumer must maintain his freedom to decide with full awareness. This proposal has no impact on the budget of the Community, Mr. Commissioner. Therefore, in terms of food safety it needs complete transparency for producers and consumers. I am convinced that the Commission will be able to follow the path indicated by the rapporteur, who, let's remind us, has achieved unanimity under the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	el
On Saturday morning, I have a meeting with all the internal ministers of the European Union, trying to see them how important it is for us to mobilize police forces, because sometimes a crisis that requires military support will develop in such a way that after a few months there is no need for so much armed forces, but more police officers are needed. Democratic institutions the country needs. We also work for this in a close and positive relationship with the Commission. Good members of the Parliament, I no longer have much to say about these topics. During these weeks there have been many more events I would like to talk about: Kosovo, Middle East, Tsetsenia;Many things I would like to discuss with you. Mr President, if you allowed you to stop to stop here and let the parliament members ask questions so that we have time to answer them. Before that, however, I would like to tell you about the telephone conversation I had a couple of hours ago with the Council of Europe Special Ambassador of the Council of Europe. Gil-Robles returned from Tsetsenia this morning, visited Grozny, and had the opportunity to call me and tell me about his first impacts that are not good, as you guess, good parliamentary members. The situation in Ingusetia refugee camps is bad and worsen;During the day, warm food is usually no longer available: the Russian authorities are no longer distributed, so at the moment NGOs are taking care of it. Grozny currently has about 20,000 people who are in a really desperate situation that has to travel several kilometers to find a place where they get something to eat. However, one thing may mean positive development, and I would like to talk to you too.with the chairman of the Cooperation Organization (OSCE) that, if possible, representatives of this organization could participate in the activities of the relief group. These are the only positive things I can tell you at this time;I hope that in the next few hours we have more information from the special ambassador Gil-Robles and, above all, better news from the Russian Federal Federation. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, I will end my speech here. I just wanted to tell you once again what I said at the beginning. I am very pleased that I can participate in the work of the Parliament, to tell you about the work done together with all countries and the Commission, which has a clear goal that our European Union can participate in the international stage as much as possible in operations that are sought to maintain peace. Europe does not intend to go to war in any region, but it intends to cooperate in favor of peace and balance in the world. I show my warm thanks to the high representative of Solan and give a speech to a member of Poettering, who will speak on behalf of the PPE-de group. Thank you, member of Poettering. Member Poettering, it is self -evident that the speech of the Commission Member Patten would be well suited to this debate. Therefore, we have agreed that he can use the speech at any time. Commission member, do you want to use the speech now or a little later?(A member of the Commission announced that he will use the speech later.) Good, thanks. Mr President, Mr Patte, Member of the Commission, Dear High Representative Javier Solan, Usted No Es Una Persona Loca, Todo Lo Contrario.(You're not crazy, on the contrary.) We are delighted with the rapid progress that has happened since the Helsinki summit.	fi
Mrs. President!The evaluation of the reform process was certainly very high, which can also be recognized, maybe a little with advance.My question: The reform is necessary not least through the accession of new countries and thus by expanding the Union.How can we - Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the accession states - also deal with this challenge even more effectively, taking into account the ideas that consideration of the accession states?The delegations do an active work - I do it in my delegation for the Czech Republic - but it can be noted that we often have a very senior teacher interaction with each other.What can the reform help to make the relationship and cooperation, the common work between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission more effective?I would like to thank the Lord for the emphasis on the fact that the reform, apart from the fact that it would be useful alone, by the accession process, the extensions is required, especially those extensions that the Union will go through shortly.It is important that we not only carry out this reform for the sake of the current union, but also to enable the accession.In the coming years I will maintain the custom that I have naturally introduced together with many of my commission colleagues to have detailed discussions with the governments of the future Member States.We do this because we want to explain the system to which you will join you in every respect.Likewise, I would also like to point out the enrichment through the further training, which is carried out in general by the Member States and the Union, so that when the new employees add to the Commission and the officials and administrative employees in the member states with the realities, the difficult realities of membership in the Union and in the domestic market, the breaking points will hardly be identified.I would like to experience such a high level of development and such a level of preparation.All I can do now is to make the promise to strive for this.First of all, I would like to wish the Lord's all the best for St. David 's Day.Thank you for your lecture.For the Commission, it is now important not to lose sight of the fact that the reform process would be a full waste of time without restoring the connection to the European public.Above all, this must never be lost sight of.The Commission must serve the public, and the recommendations for reducing payment delays are certainly highly welcome, but another great allegation of the people we represent applies to the paper war.Is there - without drawbacks in financial control - the intention of restricting bureaucracy and the paper war for applicants for European funding?This is constantly complained and there is a need for action.My second question concerns the committee for auditing.Of course, I very much welcome this, but it is also important to indicate a hint to monitor the recommendations that we pronounce from the European Parliament as part of our relief procedure.Will you include this in the work of your committee?In conclusion, I would like to say that the parliamentary group of the Social Democratic Party agrees to the measures -related budgeting and the transfer of responsibility.As Mr. Prodi put it, they will be measured on their actions and not in their words.	de
"In contrast, the 1995 Convention enables the opening of secondary procedures.In this way, exceptional situations are created for the general regulation that the Commission would like to see.After the contract of Amsterdam came into force, the Commission would have preferred to accept a new text in which the thesis of uniformity is expressly anchored.Nevertheless, in my opinion it is now not the time to question the agreement that was achieved in connection with the 1995 Convention - which was negotiated in a period of about thirty years.As a result, the Commission refused to submit a proposal and was limited to the questions of institutional nature.For this reason, the Commission also believes that it does not apply for a change to change the regulation, but would like to explain their view of the changes on the table.The Commission therefore agrees with the amendment applications proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner, Mrs No. 1, 2, 3 and 5, but not to change application No. 4. The Commission is of the opinion that the parliament should rather support the amendment no.4 of the Committee on Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs, so that the Commission can be changed to the regulation, andSupported by a regulatory committee in accordance with Article 5 of the decision EG 1999/468.As a result, the committee agrees with the amendments No. 3 and 4 submitted by the committee for freedoms and rights of citizens, judiciary and internal matters, but not the amendments No. 1 and 2 on the term ""center of the main interests of the debtor"".The center of the main interests of a society or a legal person is sufficiently defined in Article 3 as a term.For all other cases that are not treated directly, the reference in the Recording reason 13 should be regarded as sufficient.Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.(The session is closed at 00.05.) Shipwreck of the Erika According to the agenda, the pronunciation of Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna follows the oral request (B5-0011/2000) on behalf of the fishing committee to the Erika Commission.Mr. President, Commissioner, Ladies and Members!First of all, I would like to point out the appreciation that Mr. Fischler brings us towards with his present presence.Yesterday our President announced that he would be absent for schedule.I think he has covered it again and did what you get used to: he has shown this parliament of his appreciation and respect for how he always did it, and I thank him for that.Today I raise my voice in this plenary on behalf of the European Parliament's committee in order to once again draw attention to the shipwreck of the oil tanker Erika and to express our concern.A two -time political consideration causes our committee - and as its chairman - to come back to this matter again.First, to prove to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that our parliament can neither forget this serious misfortune."	de
We must have the assurance that the Council act in accordance with the way of proceeding from the Parliament.For other themes, no initiative has unfortunately been set up so far.At the time it is, we are still waiting.The European Space of Freedom, Security and Justice remains an area without clear regulations in important areas.However, we owe it to European citizens.After hearing the words of the Ministers of Justice and the Interior, I am optimistic.I conclude that we will succeed in the next six months.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I believe that the oral question of Ms. Terrón I Cusí is of interest to set foot in the dish, because six months after the establishment of our new parliament, we must be able to send a strong political message to European citizens.I believe that the Portuguese presidency can contribute positively.We all know today the immense expectations of our fellow citizens in matters of freedom, security and justice, especially social.But their disinterest, their distance, sometimes even their disgust for the political thing involves taking concrete measures in the face of their difficulties.This is the sine qua non condition to reconcile them with politics.For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, it takes a daring and generous policy, to help the poorest.A real plan to combat unemployment must be put in place, because it is the scourge on which racism, xenophobia, nationalism and racist far-right movements.Among the most deprived, and it is important that I intervene on this point, there are immigrants and refugees.Thus the conditions of almost systematic detention, the criminalization of the asylum seeker are no longer acceptable.Any asylum seeker must benefit from the right to a fair hearing and a suspensive appeal.I attended, last week, a little by chance, at Roissy airport, with a scene of rare violence where two young women, certainly clandestine, were renewed in Conakry.They were treated as the worst criminals.They were naked, dragged on the ground by the hair, framed by a horde of CRS.The Portuguese presidency must end this kind of barbaric practices.On the contrary, our role is to support, reassure, help those who flee dictatorships.The Commission had proposed the creation of a European fund for refugees.Parliament was very favorable.Instead of procrastinating on the budget granted to this fund, I think you can make the decision to set it up.The presidency and the council can concretize what has been rejected in an incomprehensible way to Tampere, even if Tampere was an important foundation.In the same way, we cannot be content to see the rise of xenophobic currents in Europe, the trivialization of discrimination, without taking major measures.The harmonization of legislation against racism is essential.What sense do you intend to give to article 13 of the treaty?What do you plan to do to promote equal treatment in terms of wages between men and women?How do you intend to work on the eradication of homophobia, racism and sexism?	fr
"Mr President, Ladies and Members, at the end of this debate, which I have followed with great attention and a lot of interest, I would like to give some considerations that add to what I have had in recent weeks in the presence of President Prodi before you.Your two rapporteurs, the Messrs of Dimitrakopoulos and Linen, recommend that the Parliament be accepted a formal statement in accordance with Article 48 in their very thorough and carefully developed report, so that the government conference can actually start work on February 14, as the Portuguese presidency proposed.On our part, after we have submitted the statement to be drawn up by the Commission on the basis of the Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that this conference can begin - otherwise thought earlier than originally thought.We know that the weeks obtained will be very useful.After reading the design of the statement and after the explanations of the speakers of the individual factions, I would like to add a few comments.First of all, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission has an understanding of the concerns expressed several times about the scope of the agenda of the conference.I understand these fears, these concerns that the agenda is too scarce;And yet I believe that, as I did after the Helsinki summit, you can work for constitutional questions in front of the committee, based on Helsinki's mandate.And in this spirit and within the framework of this mandate, the Commission has developed its own statement, whereby it fully exhausted the mandate and also read between the lines.We have not limited ourselves to what is incorrectly referred to as the three ""remnants"".Like Richard Corbett, I don't like the expression ""remnant"", which gives the impression that these are three insignificant or incidental topics.However, there are three extremely serious, important and difficult topics - so difficult that in Amsterdam the common political courage was not sufficient to treat them exhaustively.As for us - here I answer Mr. Seguro, who was concerned beforehand - we did not satisfy ourselves with these three topics, even if I think that they have priority and have to be treated now.They are the first, but not the only topics of which the conference must take on, Mr.We have also dealt with other topics, and we have shown our idea that because of the difficult situation before the expansion, other topics at the conference would have to be addressed - if the Portuguese and then later the French presidency are ready.We are ready - whether it is now the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the elaboration of which has started, the GASP and the effects of negotiations on a defense policy on the institutions or the very difficult topic of revising the contracts where we will continue to work.There were many comments on the commission's statement;All of these topics were addressed and often treated in detail, some based on exact suggestions for new articles.But nobody mentioned that we were outside of Helsinki's mandate."	de
Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen the commissioners, when this assembly is called to reflect on the theme of human rights, it runs a great risk which in a way was also emphasized by the climate in which we are called to debate this theme so important.The absence of the Council and almost all the deputies makes us aware of the abyss which still separates the noble deep and useful declarations on the formal level of the concrete application, in the field of daily policy, of human rights.I think that this Parliament, starting with the contribution that Europe will bring to the meeting of Geneva, must climb this chasm and act, not only in terms of principles, but also on that of truth and even loyalty.Human rights should not be the subject of an interpretation that is only linked to denunciation or punishment.We must, as Parliament, look at the subject of human rights especially in the sense of prevention.We must therefore be able to export a culture of legality, a culture of law, compliance of law.I believe that the long season of accumulation of treaties and signatures of treaties has definitively ended.Today we have many, perhaps too many, treated that intervene in terms of human rights: if these treaties remain only a simple utterance, they will only constitute unnecessary collections of reflection.We must go today to the next phase, that of the daily and coercive application of what is written in our treaties, even if we must not forget that certain fundamental treaties must still be accepted.I am thinking here of the Rome conference and of the fact that fourteen of the Fifteen States of the Union have not yet ratified the Treaty on the International Criminal Tribunal.I think we must verify and modify certain political instruments that serve us to measure the quality of human rights in the world.We have often used instruments which, formally, can be practical but which, on a political level, prove to be completely useless.I am thinking of the use, or even abuse, of embargo in recent years and of the too cautious application of the suspension clause of agreements between the European Union and third countries in case these do not respect human rights.I believe that we are mainly invited to update the horizon of the protection of fundamental rights.Globalization is likely to be interpreted as essentially repressive.In many countries, the principle of human rights are for the moment calls into question;It is believed that these rights and the right to life, denied by the death penalty, are dependent variables, while globalization, often taken in a punitive sense, risks being the only unifying tissue of the rights, actions and policies of all the countries of the world.	fr
Therefore, I think it is necessary to act in two directions.On the one hand, we should ask the Commission to grant special measures as part of the aid sector intended for the fishing sector in order to relieve the effects of this catastrophe on the productive sector of the affected areas, and also ask them to demand strict control of the ships driving under cheap flags.In this regard, the current negotiating process on Malta's joining the European Union must serve to demand from this country that it is rigorously checking the oil tankers driving under its flag.On the other hand, it is necessary to prevent.Portugal is a country that has given its sensitivity to the topics associated with the sea.I would like to ask the Portuguese presidency to examine the possibility of starting a comprehensive strategy for contraception of marine pollution at European level and to concentrate all means - technological, structural and socio -economic nature - from which we already have to prevent a disaster like this in the future.Finally, I would like to highlight the work done by the volunteers and the local authorities, which reminded me of old times when I experienced similar situations at the time.One has to thank them who, given the defenselessness and missing funds, courageous against the serious effects of this catastrophe for the coastal regions, for the ecosystem of the sea and the fishing resources of Europe.Mr President, as chairman of the committee for regional policy, transport and tourism, I would like to congratulate the Commission, especially Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, as to this incident, which was deeply shaken by all of Europe.In the traffic committee, we are ready to debate questions about marine safety and later, of course, about the conclusions that result from the conclusions that arise at the legal level.Allow me a few more remarks: First, the Commission has really focused on what guilt the Italian classification company Rina affects, because it must be checked whether the joint law has been applied.Here we have to start with our efforts.Secondly, in such cases, we should examine whether the charterers, for example the oil companies, are responsible in addition to the shipping companies, since they are complicit on environmental disasters like this and consequently must also pay for the removal of the damage.Apart from that, the reactions to the ecological disaster are justified in every respect.However, this must not tempt us to pillorate the entire merchant shipping, this sector that is so important for the economy, which covers around a third of the transport volume.So we have to react moderately, strict, but also sensibly.I am not at all against the fact that it is considered about the tightening of community law, but we, as other colleagues, must have emphasized from the implementation, because - and we must not forget that - there is already a legal framework at the level of the European Union.This frame is developed enough, at least if you compare the different regulations worldwide.As a result, the Member States, even under the supervision of the Commission, must finally begin to apply community law.	de
"""We do not oppose globalization,"" civil society in the end, ""but we want globalization that is blessed by mankind, and a fair world order without social exclusion.""We do not oppose the agreement with Mexico in the European Parliament. Vice versa! However, we cannot accept this agreement for the reasons mentioned above, but we still need to make the effort to make better agreements in the future. Last sentence: It is also essential that here in the European Parliament there is a critical voice that continues to support Mexican society in its justified requests and demands.- (FR) Mr President, Ferrer's report is titled so that the title looks at us at best and, in the worst case, a secret. In fact, it would be more entitled to talk about the agreement between the European Union and the Naphta, not just the agreement between the European Union and the Mexican, since this agreement himself presents is the most important agreement that the European Union has ever committed with the third country, but not only with our relations with this country, but with all our relations with North America and Central American countries. The Ferrer report defines the goal of creating a new framework in this Parliament, clearly in the style of fashion, so that European companies can compete on an equal footing, especially with the United States and Canada. Under no circumstances can the goal be achieved in the near future and it is easy to see who, in terms of the interests of the text, has been drawn up in the text. In fact, who would not notice that the recession of European exports to Mexico is the result of a NAFTA agreement, which makes the entire area one and only free trade? Thus, who can seriously think that, for example, European textile products and cars, which are currently taxed 35 % and 23 %, can soon compete with similar American export products with 1.8 %, regardless of the details of the created tool? Who, in these circumstances, is able to justify that the opening of the parties' market is at a different pace at the expense of Europeans? Who would, after all, would not be afraid that the effects on European employment in areas opened in Mexican products, on the contrary, will be immediately reflected, especially in the eager areas - only the textile industry - which does not need extra competition with the opposite of the opening of the American -closed market? In addition, terms concerning the protection of the rules of origin and, more generally, the rules applicable to mental property, which are intended to calm us, have the opposite effect, as their confusion and form seem to be threatened rather than Warranty. The Mr President, the outcome of the trade negotiations between the European Union and Mexico, from a positive point of view, could mean a new and sustainable framework for stabilizing political dialogue and cooperation if this trade agreement works for both parties. Unfortunately, the experience gained from Naphta shows that this goal was not automatically achieved because there is evidence that free trade has affected the opposite of the lives of many people, aggravated environmental damage, and replaced a large number of Mexican population - the more, since the Mexican human rights citizens have also reported the human rights.allowed Mexico to protect sensitive labor -intensive sectors and minimal environmental standards. For these reasons, we cannot be optimistic because the procedures followed in recent negotiations, which the Parliament and the Mexican Senate have been effectively monitored, provide a wealth of evidence that the agreement lacks the absolutely important mechanisms to ensure that the current damage will not be repeated in the future. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, we are going to vote on a topic that is another step forward on the new path we began to travel in mid -1995 and later, as in all new issues, had a lot of criticism and reservation."	fi
"Europe today has great difficulties. Whether he wants it or not, he does not represent the citizens of the Member States the brilliant road he would like to embody. It gives the image of what is, that is, a distant and oppressive mechanism, the only mission of which seems to be the issuance of detailed regulatory rules, with the obvious aim of achieving greater concentration and uniformity. In this context, as every year, the debate on human rights in the world and the Union, which this year is linked to the fight against racism in the Union and in the Countries, appears again. This could enable it to acquire a ""soul"" a set of horrific lifeless. But it didn't happen. The rapporteurs, the Committee on Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs and the plenary have served us ""inanimate"" texts. These supposed defenders of human rights have forgotten that man is simply not an abstract concept, a point in a political program. Human creature has a dignity, a mission that is much superior, even opposed to what they are proposing to us today. I respect human creature means I acknowledge that his legal rights correspond to legal obligations, that his freedom must be exercised in a way that his physical dignity presupposes moral references. The point is not to limit freedom but, on the contrary, to realize that man lives in the midst of a community, the family, the nation, of humanity that imposes rules without which culture becomes synonymous with barbarism. I would not say that the European Parliament missed an opportunity, but probably that once again remained faithful to itself: a fan of ruthless freedom and, after all, his killer. I was unable to vote in the Ludford Baroness exposure and I want my abstention to be perceived as particularly contemptuous, due to the injection and exaggerations contained in some excerpts in the report. Various excessive declarations and claims, especially with regard to third -country nationals residing in the Member States of the European Union, are provocative and provoke reactions that the report characterizes racist, while the majority of our member states often do not understand why we do not understand why nationals have to do so. Those, including the right to vote, as long as there is no reciprocity for the citizens of the Union who reside in these third countries. I know that with these remarks I run the risk of being presented by the media as the personification of evil and falling into the trap that set some parts of the exposure to those of us who still dare to express their opinion on the exaggeration that begins to increase the racism of racism. The European Parliament today presents us the young man in a new world. The Ludford report is not a finding of real situations, good or bad, on racism in the Union, it is the political program of a far left that supports ruthless freedom and, in the end, is not too worried about human rights."	el
In addition, the claim that monetary union could be a counterweight to globalized capital is affecting credibility. The resolution makes the request to increase the influence of the European Parliament on the Intergovernmental Conference. However, it is important to emphasize that the intergovernmental conference is and should be a conference between Member States. Those who will direct the evolution of the treaty are the parliaments of the Member States or the peoples through referendums. Therefore, it should be ruled out that the European Parliament will be granted some established influence on the process of negotiations or ratification. Mr President, the Constitutional Affairs Committee has proposed a truly positive text, which I will vote, although I had proposed many amendments to enlarge myself. What happened, however, these days show that they were right all those who had been reviewed by the way in which enlargement and revision of the conditions had been launched. It is not possible to expand the Union to 28 states without first addressing the question of whether Europe has some principles, some common values, if it is nothing but an economic zone of free exchanges, or if, on the contrary, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways of being a new union. This is what we meant and mean when we ask for a European Constitution. The amendment of the conditions has been limited to a revision of certain internal rules, a necessary and important revision, but which does not previously respond to the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and what are its objectives and boundaries? Politics, however, is angered, and, although abducted by the debate of a limited agenda, it is now making its triumphant re -entry in the case of Austria, as it is heading to the government a party that appears to be back into tendencies of intolerance, xenophobia, and forms of racism. And this is not a bond problem with the past. It is a problem of prospects for the future, and there is nothing wrong with separating, in this regard, in the right and left. I belong to the world of liberal Catholics, which does not belong to the Left, but is linked to the values ​​of tolerance and to common European values, as well as everyone else, and has nothing to do with orientations that deny these values. It was correct for the Council to raise this issue in Europe and the world, and if we do not remember these values ​​on a map of fundamental rights, in a European Constitution, we will build a Europe without constant and constant bases. I know, Barnier Commissioner - or at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: take advantage of the margins left by the December conference to include these issues and these principles, because we will only build a Europe that will build a Europe.	el
"We know the rest.It would then be necessary to establish a reliable technical control like the compulsory technical control in France for vehicles of more than five years.It would be necessary to regulate the use of pavilions of complacency, require the double hull for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, innovate in technological matters to manage to treat or collect hydrocarbons at sea. It would be, I think, a minimum, at the dawn of the third millennium.It would be necessary to prohibit the non-compliant ships access to European waters, determine the responsibility of polluters, shipowners, charters in the name of the ""polluter pays"" principle, strengthen maritime surveillance to avoid degassing, impose a serious and reliable control of tankers, restore a budgetary line ""natural"" consequent "", for member countries, and in the meantimeeligible for structural funds the disaster departments.I also deposited on behalf of the EDD group a resolution on this subject.The President, in recent years, of disasters involving oil tankers have regularly occurred around the world, without taking measures worthy of the name or effective.This time, it is particularly serious, and this too because it affected a great European state, an event that can happen at any time.To limit these dangers, we have the urgent need for a directive.Fifteen manifestly are not enough for it.Without claiming completeness, it would guarantee at least three points: no cargo or oil will no longer be able to wet in a port of the European Union if it is good for breakage;All those concerned, including the transportation of transport, are responsible for the damage that may occur;And these people must contract sufficient insurance.It is only in this way that the victims will have a chance to see their requests for compensation.However, we must see that the long -term objective must still go further.This means that we must really establish the truth of costs for the entire energy supply system.Mr. President, let me start by thanking Ms. Palacio Commissioner for the appropriate, clear and firm answer that she gave.I thank him very, very sincerely.This means that I also have the biggest esteem for the information note that she sent us on January 10 but also for the actions that she announced today.The Erika disaster highlights the fact that when strict transportation regulations are lacking at European and international level, nature and the environment always suffer.The resulting damage, especially from an ecological point of view, do not express themselves in money.This is also why the debate takes place in common with the colleagues of transport and the environment.During the Christmas holidays, when the Dutch media looked at the disaster of the Erika, I went to throw a stroke of the Internet to get an idea of ​​the situation and see what measures it would be necessary to take, especially after Prime Minister Jospin said that Europe should be more active in this area."	fr
The fact that the Russian battle tanks retired in 1994 was often quoted: 'We will come again!'It did not contribute to promoting the understanding between the peoples of the Baltic and the Russians. Despite these burdens, after the recovery of their independence, there has been no incident of a violent confrontation between the majority and the minority of the population in these countries. We should therefore express to the Estonians and the Latvians our unequivocal recognition who nevertheless maintained their temper and are open to our arguments when it comes to adapting important points of their legislation to European standards. For this reason, I am of the opinion that the explicit appeal in Article 14 of the Belder report is not needed, which calls for the continuation of the measures to integrate Russian minorities. That is exactly what is already happening there. When explicitly stated, the incorrect impression that is not already there may be there. Mr President, it is a fact that in recent years, at the same time, at the same time as an increase in migration, a climate of prejudice has begun to serve and racist violence became more and more frequent, and even political parties were created on the basis of racist ideology. That is, a social climate is created that appeared in a wing of our parliament this morning, which suggests that the protection of human dignity, respect for diversity, democratic values ​​and social solidarity have not yet been fully conquered. For this reason, our action to respect human rights and the creation of a just society with creative coexistence of people should be part of a wide range of policies and measures aimed at improving economic and social conditions for all, combating unemployment, poverty. The new multicultural reality in Europe needs to be accompanied by a policy that will ensure the integration of immigrants and various social groups and minorities into the social, political and economic life of national societies. We certainly need a common European asylum and immigration policy on the basis of European humanitarian values. The field of education is also important, of course, and there should be great improvements in the education of immigrants and gypsies. At the same time, the media is called upon to contribute to the fight against prejudices, demonstrating the beauty of the multicultural and multiculturalism of modern societies. Of course, in this context, respect for those who cite reasons of consciousness, for example, should be given. On the occasion I would like to assure the European Parliament that the problem that has existed in Greece in the past no longer exists, after adopting and implementing legislation from 1.1.1998. So the relevant reference to Mr Haarder's otherwise excellent report is today. I would like to express my indignation that the United States, the strongest country on the planet, which claims to be personifying the vanguard of culture, applies the death penalty to a large extent. Regardless of the risk of judicial error, what can one think of a society, which in order to take revenge for nasty and barbaric acts committed by some individuals, puts a real judicial machine in order to commit deliberately, cold, an equally barbaric act? What can you say except that in this way this society adopts a behavior worse than it condemns? The requirement to abolish the death penalty everywhere is the least that one can do if it claims to protect human rights.	el
"Especially in view of the acceptance of the Directives by the Council, I call on the Commission to fully adopt the amendments accepted by parliament, even if they are partially divergent from the Commission's original proposals. I am absolutely convinced that on this basis we will be able to more easily conquer the consent of the Council. I will now refer to the most important amendments we propose. One substantial difference consists that instead of the system of ""service card, plus any case of service case"" no longer provides for the possibility of a prior announcement in the host country of each individual award. We consider this system unsuitable for practical reasons. However, all possible obstacles should have been lifted before the issuance of the service card must be lifted and compared to the committee's proposal, more stringent conditions should be met. Conditions: Regular employment, legal stay and social security should not only be met at the time of the card issuance but for the entire duration of the card and three months after its expiration. This ensures the host state that the employee or self -employed will return after completing his work in his country of origin and that it is covered by insurance in the event of illness or accident. Entrance and stay should have been clarified by a legal point of view prior to the granting of the service card and even in the context of the objection process. It is envisaged that the application for the 'service card - is needed for all States, but it can only be submitted for one particular state. I also find that this system also responds to practical needs. I hope that the same will apply for the proposal to reduce the time of previous employment to three months and the validity of the service card - EC to be flexible to the time of the previous regular employment. We remain, however, that the power duration should not exceed 12 months. In the case of the self -employed, along with the amendments we have already presented, we suggest that the criterion of staying should become stricter and it will also be provided for a possibility to address the possible abuse of the right to free traffic by only seemingly self -employed individuals. I will soon refer to the amendments that are moving further than the amendments submitted by the Committee on Legal Issues and Internal Markets. Of course I would like to emphasize that I still support all the amendments to the Committee on Legal Issues that had been unanimously accepted. I also submitted four amendments on behalf of my team that essentially refer to the correct way of referring to the Council decisions. I must say that I have received very contradictory information from the services of Parliament on the correct way of referring to the Council decisions, that is, only the number should be stated, or only the date or both and how extensive the referral should be. The services canceled two amendments because their content was allegedly taken into account in the report."	el
I therefore delighted that the responsibility is attributed to individuals without the commission relieving its responsibility.In practice, experiences - only 9 files have been refused, 94 % of the cases that the Commission had to deal with were not formally settled but via unpublished administrative letters, legally non -binding, or simply by expiration of the time -clever period clearly that at the age of globalization and the enlargement of the EU, the work of the Commission is limited by temporal, personal and financial constraints.To conclude, I would like to say what I expect from this reform: fair competition and the same conditions of competition for all, legal security for all businesses, a uniform application of competition policy, a simplification of procedures in accordance with the principle of the one -stop shop, the coordination of the national authorities that I believe I should be independent, close cooperation of the authorities and national courses with the Commission as well as a clear distribution of skills andnationals in the application of European competition law and agreements.From the Commission, I expect that it focuses on the essentials by accomplishing its main guardians of European competition policies.I look forward to seeing what form will take the vast discussions in the first legislative proposal.The Commission's report confirms that, aside from Germany, state aid to businesses are increasing.This only worries the Commission from the point of view of the conditions of competition.For our part, we place ourselves from the point of view of the interest of laborious classes.The company does not gain anything from these enormous transfers of public funds to private companies.Look at the automobile, where subsidies and various aids of states increased by 24 % during the reference period.What to do?It is not to preserve jobs.All of these companies have made job cuts, or even layoffs.It is not to improve working conditions, because by producing more workers, working conditions worsen.Do these companies need the help of states to survive?No, car companies have had colossal profits for years.State aid is not only perverse, because, as the Jonckheer report recognizes, they lead to a hunt for subsidies by relocations from one country to another, they are unacceptable because they devote public money to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders.It is because everywhere we promote the richest with state money that everywhere in Europe we reduce social protection, we abandon public services, we close hospitals.The meaning of my vote against the Jonckheer report is to assert the need for another policy, that is to say the cessation of all aid to private companies and the use of money thus saved to develop public services and hire staff.Mr. President, the debate that we hold today is of extraordinary importance because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the domestic market.Pursuant to the principle of competition, the regulations have developed articles 85 to 94, properly said competition policy, the revision of all state aid and tax provisions likely to distort competition.	fr
Mr President, the Member of the Commission, the good colleagues, I would like to say that I am particularly remote areas, and among them the French seafood department, have been taken into account in the Interreg III initiative, which gives them new cooperation opportunities in their own geographical area, although it is true that they are. Undoubtedly, as the remnant of colonial power, our region has long been catching up with or even disregarded or even despised their neighbors. This time is already part of the past. Our regions have become aware that they belong to the surrounding area not only for geographic reasons but also for the culture of these areas and the history of the peoples living in these areas, which is why our regions have a strongly expressed effort to commit to this environment. This awareness does not only apply to the identity of the regions. It is based on the legitimate appreciation of our own good qualities. Thus, for example, the island of Réunion is located in the area of ​​southern Africa and Southeast Asian countries. It cannot be excluded from regional groups operating in this area and takes the risk of losing a historical opportunity, and the same applies to our Caribbean regions. So we are convinced that our young people can see a way out of the great unemployment that plagues it if we can take the skill knowledge they have acquired with the support of the European Structural Funds. Using Interreg's funds, our regions can make real European Union bridge heads in these areas and thus give the Union a global dimension. I rely on the Commission, and especially on roads, the consignment member of the Commission, in the efficacy of the efficiency of the actions in these areas. Mr President, good members of the Commission, I am very pleased that cooperation between Europe areas can be increased within the Interreg framework, but I am worried that the proposal offers less opportunities for sea areas than in other areas. I understand the Commission's own view that distance can be harmful to effective cooperation. However, connections have already been established between many sea areas. Many local authorities in the North Sea region are an excellent example of this. Interreg could well increase such cooperation. As a result, I would like a few small repairs to the guidelines to get a little more flexibility and take into account the foreground aspects of sea areas between A and Alan B. By these corrections, I mean to find out about the opportunities for cooperation between the sea areas and give the opportunity to develop more practical projects, especially if they concern infrastructure. Such measures will make sea areas and island areas equal to other EU regions. I hope they will be accepted. The Mr President, our group, is positive about the horizontal endeavor of the Equal initiative, that is, that as a British Limble, some of the need for an excluded category would no longer have to choose: their own expertise and experience can be used to solve problems. Specialized organizations have a lot of expertise to tell others. We are also pleased that the need to evaluate and distribute best practices to promote internationalization has been recognized. That is why we are concerned, like others, of the number of checks that aim to drive even more discriminating even more discriminated against through a narrow refugee definition. My group is not going to support such checks. Nor do we like the many checks that, under the guise of greater flexibility efforts, may obscure liability issues related to the management of the Equal initiative. Mr President, I am happy to see that the Urban initiative takes into account a more integrated approach and that it tries to solve dependent problems. Mr President, however, there is a risk of decentralization: when you drive many goals, the whole thing remains ineffective.	fi
There has been an obvious imbalance in the operating conditions of these markets, which, of course, definitely requires significant corrections, which in turn also require new options for development policies. Therefore, a new model of development policies is needed, and I would like to emphasize that it requires us to work for four key aspects: first, it requires improving cooperation between all international actors at the level of the donors, coordination, consistency and connection between humanitarian aid and development policies, multibetter consideration;However, in countries that are currently receiving development aid, there is definitely a need for some new ways of working, namely the fight against corruption, taking democracy and good management as the basic principles of their political systems, and in addition to drawing special attention to their own policies to relieve poverty. The second aspect of this new model of development policies is that we need to have a more comprehensive view of development cooperation and not a view that is seen as the only area of ​​this policy. Other politicians, such as economic, trade and investment policies, are also increasingly increasingly increasing, but it is also necessary that this holistic view of development cooperation will be adopted at the level of both global policies and policies of different donors. The third aspect of this new model, which I would like to emphasize, is related to the politics aimed at achieving goals. While the most important international donor states had reviewed the matter in 1995, especially at the level of the OECD's Development Aid Committee, it was possible to define some important goals that should guide the targeting and implementation of development policies at both nation states and international levels. According to these goals, poverty is being reduced by half the 2015, as is known, promoting the proliferation of compulsory schooling, reducing child infant mortality considerably and influencing social well -being in different ways so that this goal could indeed be achieved. It would mean to alleviate extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world's population lives to alleviate the living conditions of nearly a billion people living in extreme poverty. Achieving this goal cannot be considered impossible, but it really requires strong participation and intense intervention from the entire international community. Here is the fourth aspect of a new kind of development cooperation, which I would like to emphasize: development policies are nowadays, especially in recent years, in a more global context that has no strong international leadership. It has been significantly influenced by the joint measures of the institutions of the United Nations, but also the Bretton Woods system. In particular, it is important to mention that this debate has been significantly promoted by the World Bank, especially in its Comprehensive Framework document and the International Monetary Fund: For the first time, such an institution will take the problem of poverty relieving the problem of political guidelines and commits to relief of debt and dismissal. International organizations also deal with problems related to development cooperation in this new role, so we must consider the role of the European Union in this context. The Presidential State Portugal has emphasized that the European Union has to better reconcile its very important international role as the most important contributor and leading and more active role in these aspirations for international development policies and improves connection and coordination, especially with the United Nations system and Bretton Woods. In order to strengthen the role of the European Union in international development policies, we find it necessary to take three types of actions in particular. First of all, the effectiveness of its development policy must be improved. As is known, the overall assessment of development policies was made in 1995 and the conclusions of this overall assessment could be submitted during the German presidency. The main conclusions emphasized that the European Union needs a more consistent policy and a general strategic view of problems related to development cooperation. They emphasized aspects of increasing coordination and supplementation between politicians, harmonizing and simplifying the current development policy of the Union's organizational framework, enhancing and renewing its support mechanisms, and enhances the assessment system.	fi
It will then be necessary, as I pointed out, to change the paradigm and to forget the post-colonial paradigm to give a more European dimension to development policies.From this point of view, I think (like some stakeholders) that the new convention called to replace Lomé conventions constitutes an important instrument for renovation and new dynamics in the approach of a partnership with such a large group of countries in the South, at the time when there is stability around the negotiation processes on an international scale, like those who characterized the first cycle of Seattle negotiations.I feel a certain degree of frustration in many contributions to this debate.I made before you a declaration on behalf of the commission which, I think, offers a useful framework for this discussion.We will provide more detailed information directly linked to all consistency issues.This debate is not new.We are working there for the time in the Commission and, the work completed, I will present a report in the matter, since many were those who asked if it was possible to see the report on consistency.I have no doubt that, due to the growing political attention granted to these problems which clearly emerged from today's debate -it will be easier for the Commission and the DG of development to place the question of coherence at the top of our work order.This also requires the introduction of new additional mechanisms within the commission system which may very well include, as some political groups of this Parliament suggested, the establishment of a special interservice working group and a form of coherence control within the Commission.I read - and heard during the debate - that consistency is used as a kind of miracle formula that suits everything.I think it is important to leave it to the relatively well defined discipline rank aimed at trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and there are most certainly.This is largely linked to a real disagreement between sectoral interests in each Member State, as has been said with great honesty in this assembly.People identify in a way with their spheres of interest, which is legitimate.However, I would like to warn against the illusion that the inconsistency results from a certain mechanical disability of the system.This happens but represents only a small part of what we are talking about.Most of the debate relates to the well -known differences in interest established between the sexes and so on, and there is the problem.Mr. Mulder said that no farmer will begin to produce anything if the price is too low.This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective.They are farmers, not only to earn a living, but also to live, that makes a difference.	fr
Mr President, therefore, I hope that the chairman Prodi will explain to us tomorrow what he wanted or wanted to mean with these words, so that no one, definitely, could use this message in an unusual and inappropriate way, and in addition to the will of the chairman Prod to promote his dangerous political action in Austria. Thank you, member Wurtz. Good colleagues, I ask that you do not start to argue: this was a procedure proposal. I will remind you, member Wurtz that tomorrow Chairman Prodi will submit a statement on the Commission's work program. Of course, in the discussion after this statement, you are completely free to ask her, as well as the chairman Prodi is completely free to answer you. I recommend that you thoroughly investigate this if you want and if the chairman will want. Mr President, I'm very sorry that I have to strain you again with something I have taken here twice before. I have told you a few times that we Dutch Parliament members would like a Dutch television channel. This parliament now shows 28 channels, two of which are Greek, one Portuguese, one Finnish and one Belgian, but there are still no Dutch channels, even though there are seven English, six Germans and six French. I was promised in September that by January, one Dutch channel would see. Now it's February and nothing has happened. I would like to ask you to do something about it again. I wonder what medieval bureaucracy is in the barrier to the Dutch channel to be transmitted through satellite. Good member of the Parliament Plooij-Van Gorsel, I'm really disappointed because I was absolutely convinced that the matter would have been resolved long ago. Yes, I have heard that you often make requests for this issue and I think a member Banotti can answer you. So I will give a member Banotti a speech for the procedure proposal so that he can respond to you. Mr President, like a good friend of mine Elly probably knows, I do my best to make him and my Dutch colleagues happy. I would like to convince you as a Quarter responsible for this that we have had different technical discussions on television and radio channels, and I have already sent mail to colleagues in this context. If it helps, I can tell you that even the Irish have not yet received their own channel. It seems that we have difficult technical problems, but we are seriously working for the job. Thank you for giving me the opportunity to make this clear. I do not know if this was calm our Dutch colleagues, as our Irish colleagues cannot watch the national channel either. I think we have to look at what can be done so that all our colleagues have the opportunity to watch their own channel. Thank you, a member Banotti, and thanks to the other Quartors for trying to do something about it. Mr President, I would like to tell a member Wurtz that the Commission does not follow Brezhnev's limited sovereign doctrine and that until the other other matter is not covered by Articles 6 and 7. Austria thus has a full right to form a government, and the chairman of the Commission is in full right and even the obligation to congratulate Austria warmly. Member of Wurtz might be worth remembering that it is not a long time when his party friend, the Communist leaders of the French cities, sent butt tractors to destroy immigrant homes in France. Order of the Proceedings of the Presidency Meeting in accordance with Article 110 of the Rules of Procedure has been divided into the final version of the agenda.a) Sessions 14.18. February 2000 in Strasbourg Wednesday: President. As a council representative cannot be present on Wednesday evening, many groups of the European People's Party, the Socialist Group of Parliament, the Liberals, the Greens and the Left have requested that the Council of Cyprus' statement and Brok report on the Cypriot and Malta strategy would be discussed in the Cyprus and Malta. The report would be postponed.	fi
In my opinion, it is important to refer to one thing: Leader+ -related expenditure can be supported from the time the program is under consideration of the Commission. It is also possible to order the date of the eligibility of the eligibility to be retroactively retroactively on 1 January. In paragraph 20 of the draft resolution, the concrete proposal for the guidelines will be discussed. After a thorough consideration, I can tell you that the Commission can accept proposals 2, 4, 5 and 7 and include them in the guidelines. Proposal 6 will also be partially included because it is confirmed that the time limit for approval of the programs of the Leader+Initiative is up to five months. In the meantime, the proposal for change 1 has already launched, as this paragraph was already converted to the will of the Parliament to the will of agricultural structures and rural development in the administrative committee after discussions with Member States. Therefore, only a proposal for amendment 3 will remain. However, I have to add that Member States believe that the cooperation of our action groups with similar groups outside the European Union has gone too far. Therefore, the Administrative Committee decided to change, but in the modified version, the Commission now takes into account the request for Parliament and proposes guidelines as such. It also further efforts to accept Member States. I will briefly address thirteen checks. The Commission cannot accept only three of them, namely 3, 12 and 13. All others can accept either fully or in a content..(EL) Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, is an exceptional coincidence that the European Parliament is currently dealing with the Equal initiative. Recently, due to the political development of Austria, there has been a growing political concern in Europe, and there have been political demonstrations and political dialogue. It should be emphasized that both Parliament and the Commission have proposed concrete policies, legislative proposals, and proposals for action programs that reject discrimination and concerning the construction of free and fair communities. So I speak of an anti -discrimination package and, from this point of view, I urge the committees responsible for the parliament to appoint rapporteurs so that the anti -discrimination package can be taken forward as soon as possible. I move on to the Equal initiative, which of course is based on Article 13. According to Article 13, the Equal Initiative concerns the combat of all forms of discrimination, ie gender, breed, age or injury. I would like to congratulate Member Stenzel in particular because he has had a very difficult and complex task to bring in a consensus on the Equal initiative, because the responsible committees are looking at the issue from a very different perspective and because the subject is politically very sensitive. The first attention, which many colleagues have highlighted, concerns whether women should be mentioned separately. I agree that we cannot fully agree with the content of Article 13, but in this form the establishment agreement is currently, and there is equally emphasizing discrimination on the basis of gender. Thus, on the basis of the current agreement, the Equal Initiative is built in this way. However, I would like to remind you that there is a special focus on the employment strategy for women and how a special program, the fifth program between women and men, is being prepared. I have divided things into four classes that the valuable parliamentary members have dealt with. First, expanding the theme sectors. There are four theme sectors, as in the employment strategy: employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities for women and men;And we agree to expand these theme sectors in accordance with the proposals made by the European Parliament. As for the concern that a country receives all the funds assigned to a particular type of discrimination, I say that the initiative clearly states that Member States must present the theme of each group suffering from discrimination.	fi
"Mr President, I have to say that the principles presented by the Commission member made a particular impression on me. If we can restrict the changes to the rules of the qualified majority related to the activities of the internal market, to the practices and minimum rules created by court decision, I am indeed from us that these changes will be successful if all countries are accepted. At the same time, I can conclude that if the Commission wants to adhere to these three good principles, it must at some point disagree with the presidential remark. After all, the Presidium has submitted a proposal to use the majority decision to be used in matters dealt with in the third part of Article 137 (3) of Article 3, which relates to the protection of employees and employers' interests and in the second part of Article 137 (3) concerning the termination of the employment contract. It is difficult for me to understand how the reasoning can be given on the basis of these three principles, which the Commission member raised. On this basis, can I draw a conclusion that the Commission does not want to follow the remark of the Presidium for these proposals? Member of the Commission, you are careful and therefore support your approach. I would just like to tell you the justification of the principle of subsidiarity that in my opinion, it is also important to emphasize the justification of citizenship on these tax issues. After 50 years of construction in Europe, it is impossible to accept that European citizens are not equal in front of the law because of the separation between permanent residents and temporary residents. Thus, the concept of citizenship is a common interest, for which it is necessary to override failures such as the Helsinki Council of Helsinki. I would like to ask you three accurate questions: First question: Do you think the system you propose to us may enter into force, given the integration of the money economy and their necessary tax regulation? Another question: Is your proposed system planned to decide on environmental taxation by a qualified majority? Third question: could the Council do the final majority of the eligible majority of the tax havens within the European Union? Member of the Commission, thanks for your communication. I am not sure that no one here is opposed to the intervention of fraud and tax evasion, but I have to say that it is imperative that citizens' confidence in the Union will remain, and I think many Member States would like to consider quite carefully all kinds of majority decisions before consent. The matter directly touches on what is considered to be the opportunity for Member States to deal with their own affairs. I mean, in particular, issues such as withholding tax, as it would have been quite impossible to accept a majority decision. I hope these things are kept in mind when looking at the practical level of carrying out a package. We are quite pleased that we reject fraud and tax evasion and to develop legislation in the field of social security, but there are some points that would be difficult to convince all Member States to convince them of their compliance. Dear Member of the Commission, I would like to ask you a couple of very simple questions, both questions only require ""yes"" or ""no"". Can you guarantee that the Commission does not seek under any circumstances to use the majority majority to set up a withholding rate? Can you give the same guarantees for the proposed tax on the fuels on the proposed airplane, which was discussed this week in Ecofin and can you guarantee this with regard to corporate tax in the European Union? Is it possible in some circumstances that the Commission would seek to use the majority majority of the above? Can you guarantee that the Commission does not intend to use the majority majority of the new subject? Mr President, I can imagine that, according to some colleagues, citizens are delightful to address the community level in tax and social issues. I can tell you that in my country, many citizens are concerned that Europe does not actually do anything about social and tax issues because of the requirement of a consensus."	fi
However, factors in the sector complain of the limited role played by the EU and the confused nature of funding for the neutralization of the mines. Is the Commission able to provide detailed information on the EU resources in activities related to the mines against persons? How much money is being granted for mines's neutralization programs and how much for the mines of neutralization technology? Would it be in a position for the committee to develop an annual program for the policy of neutralizing the mines in order to cease to exist today's opacity? Is it possible for the Commission to state what progress has been made in the training sector, for the mines of persons, a regulation that will provide a legal basis to these activities and will integrate all these activities into a transparent context? Question No.113 of K. (H-0251/00): Subject: Action of the European Union against the use of mines against staff at the budgetary level, the programs of action against the use of all kinds of mines, should be funded exclusively by position B7-661, the legality of which has been enhanced? What measures will be taken to ensure actual access to NGOs to Union funding? In the context of the assistance provided the accession and implementation of the Ottawa Convention, what will be the criteria and ways of implementing EU actions, so as not to cause the victims of the most exposed to the most exposed to the problem? I hope you forgive me that in order to answer the questions together I will need a little more time. I am very pleased that I am given the opportunity today to answer Mr. Van Den Bos's question about staff mines. I will also take this opportunity to answer Mrs Carlotti's question. The Commissioners today approved a statement and a draft regulation on the European Union's action against the mines, with the aim of achieving better cohesion, as well as greater efficiency and promotion of the very important activities of this sector where we are already involved. In this way we respond and exploit the Parliament's initiative to create a specific budget for action against the mines. The mines against staff cause tremendous accidents in many of the poorest parts of the world. But they are not just a constant and insidious threat to people's life and physical integrity. They are obstacles to economic growth and implementation of a series of Community programs to support reconstruction, rehabilitation, and development. That is why the Union is already involved in many actions against mines across the globe and the reason why we were so active in the negotiations and the conclusion of the Ottawa Convention on the prohibition and destruction of mines by personnel, which came into force a year ago. For the last eight years, the European community's support for the action against the mines exceeded 180 million euros. We made interventions in every corner of the world. We have supported the action of national authorities, international organizations and mainly NGOs. We have contributed to the neutralization and destruction of the mines, but also to the strengthening of victims and the investigation into new mines. To date, however, we have not followed a coherent comprehensive approach to our action against the mines. In order to take full advantage of the variety of instruments and financial mechanisms we have at our disposal, we must ensure a framework within which we can shape the necessary horizontal guidelines and priorities in order to ensure efficiency and consistency in what we do.	el
However, the problem is how to find the right solution to enhance women's chances of gaining trust and thus involved in decision -making. In some countries of the European Union, compulsory quota systems have been reinforced by law, which immediately balance women's participation. However, this is generally not the best solution, as there are not always enough women who want to join the difficult, competitive world that they consider strongly to be masculine because traditionally it has only been for men. In political parties, women are not 50 %, nor in work or social life. It is much lower, and in order to increase women's influence, women's share should be increased at this basic level. The fact that more women are capable and ready to take responsibility and commit commitments in political life, that is, decision -making, also requires a strong and real political will. The group of the People's Party is not completely unanimous that the compulsory quota system should be supported. Some people even oppose it. Personally, I wouldn't want to feel like a quota and think that I was in a particular job because I was born to be a woman. Men never have this feeling and is a significant difference. Mr President, I would like to thank the chairman of the Council and the members of the Commission for their good speeches, which I think give real hope, especially because both women even radiated the will and interest in this matter. In my opinion, a member of the Commission gave a brilliant example in saying that it would be impossible to imagine that 15 Member States would not be equal to representing, but that nothing is noticeable when it comes to women's representation. It could hardly be expressed more clearly. I also hope that a member of the Commission - after all, is young and strong - is tireless enough to take the necessary reforms in the Commission. I am convinced that it is really hard work. If a member of the Commission requests support from Parliament, he or she may, in any case, be sure of the liberal group support. In our opinion, it is very important that the Commission becomes equal and ensuring the necessary decision-making provision is to ensure that a member of the Commission is able to fulfill his or her equality perspective. I would like to tell the Portuguese minister that I fully agree with him that equality will not be realized without the distribution of power. It's quite crucial. At the same time, however, we must remember that no one voluntarily abandons power, and it applies to both men and women. Men have never wanted to give up their own power, but very few women have voluntarily giving up their power-in this context I think about the power of children in particular. I would also like to say that this may be one of the reasons why so few men are present today. Of course, for the same power political reasons, we also have to have more or less of this debate. In other words, I would like to emphasize that it is about having both parties to dispose of power. A member of the Commission emphasized that we need a kind of combination of different policies, and he mentioned in particular in Finland and Sweden. I just would like to say that he could have mentioned Denmark as well. Of course, I say this because I am from Denmark myself.45 % of the Danish Board members are women, which is actually slightly more than in Finland. We do not have female presidents, but on the other hand, we have a queen, which can be considered to level the situation in certain contexts. I would like to deal with a few points mentioned by the Commission member, the first to be the issue of financial funds. We must definitely accept that it has a price if the equality of women is to be implemented in the short term.	fi
The presidency takes note of its concern and will forward it via the corresponding channels.Violence between the population groups in Mitrovica and the location of the Albanian prisoners in Serbia, especially the Flora Brovina case).(Fri) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!We have not signed the present compromise closure application for two reasons.First of all, one of our colleagues, who is known for his open and tolerant attitude, made Mr. Sakellariou - as not to name - inserted his vehement veto against it because he wanted to defend their moral values.I do not doubt, and you will probably not doubt that this is a newly important contribution that he makes to the fight against racism and against intolerance.Second, the present application for a resolution is unfortunately not of very large scope.Through a number of tricks, it was possible to carefully avoid the treatment of the central question, namely the final status of Kosovo.Probably none of them should assume that Kosovo could one day belong to Yugoslavia.Likewise, none of them will accept that Milosevic could last for a long time if the international community would finally find a solution to the question of the final status of Kosovo.After all, none of them will believe that in the current situation Milosevic will have no interest in doing everything possible to destabilize Kosovo, which he does and what we have already experienced.Finally, in my opinion, none of them can believe that the current status quo only contributes to the stability and thus to the development of Kosovo.Incidentally, it is interesting to read a lapsus undertaking in the compromise application, which has undoubtedly missed them.They condemn the first immediate attack on KFOR members.I don't want you to be misfortune, but I'm afraid that you will ultimately be if you don't treat the real problem, and I make you fully responsible for what can happen.In my opinion, we have to ask the Commission and the Council, which is unfortunately absent today, to emphasize the question of the final status of Kosovo, the growing number of small states in this region, the development according to Dayton and finally the question of real stability, which finally enables the development of democracy in these countries.In conclusion, I would like to point out that we had asked for a determined action on the part of the Council and the Commission for the release of the 3,000 Kosovo-Albanian prisoners as well as Ms. Brovina, Mr. Kurti and Mr. Hoti.I find that the Union is facing a certain relaxation of the sanctions without so far only one of these prisoners have been released in return.For what reason?Mr. President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is terrible and reprehensible.Violence leads to violence, revenge creates revenge.The police forces sent are not strong enough to put an end to the processes.The senior police commissioner, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his despair that he can only have over half of the agreed forces.	de
We do not know very well how the responsibilities between governments and the committee are distributed, what role does the labor unions play in civil society. Therefore, we would like to take into account additional analyzes and make clearer commitments, to have a special point to enhance employment and social cohesion in the information society - because the Commission's announcement includes nothing about this issue - and to have a strategy with instructions and instructions. We want to talk about adults, and not just young people, to talk about disadvantaged social groups, we also want to remember the equality of opportunities. The new society cannot be a reason for a new inequality between men and women. We are given, Mr. Commissioner, great opportunities, but they must concern the whole population. And we want the European social model to be supported. Therefore, we ask you to take a step forward, make clearer commitments and make much more specific political and financial efforts. Mr President, Mr Commissioner Liikanen, dear colleagues, the e -Europe - the information society for everyone - as the European Commission's initiative is called. It is undisputed that new technologies will lead to profound changes not only in professional life but also to all aspects of social life. It is also righteous that the evolution of industrial society to intelligence society cannot stop and therefore it can only be political to prepare Europe in the best possible way for information society. Consequently, I expressly welcome the statement contained in the e-Europe initiative that its primary goal is to accelerate the positive change in the direction of the Information Society in the European Union and to orient it to social and regional integration. In its announcement on the E-Europe Initiative, the European Commission presents ten measures aimed at gaining the ground for Europe's course to the information society. As commendable as the individual measures are, they need to be structured in all of them and clear priorities for politics. This implies that clear differences should be made of the duties that the European Union itself and the duties that will be under the jurisdiction of individual Member States itself should and should perform. It should be borne in mind that some Member States and some regions have been promoting new technologies and their acceptance by citizens for years. Consequently, the Council Summit in Lisbon should make recommendations in individual states, but not imposed wide liabilities and particularly not excessive financial burdens. What should the European Union do as part of the e-Europe initiative? From my point of view, the Union corresponds to the following priorities that Mrs Read should have mentioned as central points in her exhibition, which I would like to thank warmly. First, we need to create an open, modern, high -performance multimedia infrastructure. It must be a task of policy to ensure that high quality communication services can be provided and demand for high quality communication services, computer and television. It should also become cheaper for all citizens to access the internet. Therefore, competition in local networks should be more promoted, eg through the release of local loop.	el
"The first principle refers to the preparation of a new ""agreement"" between a farmer and society, which makes the farmer become a ""rural administrator"", which means that society pays for environmental services in order to keep the countryside as an opportunity for leisure activities. The second principle is based on a statement that today most of the rural jobs are outside the traditional agricultural sector, for which a complete development program must be developed, which includes rural development and agricultural policies: rural development thus becomes one of the columns of a common agricultural policy. The Leader Community Initiative was introduced in 1991 to support a new strategy for rural development based on activities from the bottom upwards and differentiation of different initiatives by adjusting them to meet local needs. The objectives set are as follows: Improving the development of rural areas on the basis of local initiatives, supporting the acquisition of rural development information, and disseminating the above information to other rural areas. The Leader I Initiative was aimed at rural areas that included target 1 and 5B of the Structural Funds. The program participated in 217 local action groups and funding was EUR 1,155 million. Unfortunately, the Leader II initiative, which has extended to 1994, has not yet been finalized in 1999, but the program was wider than the Leader I. There were more than 800 supporters, and the amount of subsidies granted after the redistribution was more than EUR 4 billion. In October 1999, the European Commission decided to continue the initiative with the success of Leader I and Leader II initiatives. Unfortunately, for the years 20002006, a total of only EUR 2,020 million has been planned and guidelines are given to distribute it between different Member States. The Leader+Initiative differs from the previous stages in that this time it includes all rural areas. This initiative is also more ambitious than before and is more responsible for future challenges in rural areas. Basic changes apply to the following aspects: All EU rural areas are part of the Leader+program, the selection criteria for local actions will be stricter in the future, the topics that need to be prioritized and the integrated local development plans may be based, such as the use of information technology or impaired. So I consider continuing the initiative to be a good thing because, as I have already said, innovative development strategies are more evident, and as the initiative is even more ambitious, although it is still necessary to make more flexible criteria that define cohesion areas and not sparsely populated areas. I believe that networking is crucial for the exchange of knowledge and skills and the implementation of joint projects in different EU regions, and I remind you that, among other things, existing tools, such as so -called. Carrefour information centers. I support the Commission's proposal and consider comprehensive subsidies to be a better alternative, but I emphasize that accounting obligations on national and regional authorities must be properly defined. I am sorry that the Leader initiative, like three other initiatives, has been introduced to the Parliament late, and the delay in delaying the whole process. Finally, I would say that I am concerned about the lack of allocated appropriations, especially given that this time the program is open to all areas of the Union and will be applied for a year longer than the previous Leader II program. I thank the implementing commission units for their sympathy and their willingness to cooperate and my colleagues sitting in the Agricultural Committee for participating in the report by submitting their reviews..(De) My President, Good Colleagues, Equal Program Reports is a statement in nature that is part of the hearing process related to the new community initiative, which aims to promote new methods to prevent discrimination and all kinds of inequalities in the labor market. The report was very laborious because it includes the statements of the Committee on Industrial, Foreign Trade, Research and Energy, the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee, Women's Rights and Equality Committee, the Committee on Civic Freedom, and the Committee on Legal and Interior."	fi
That can't go on like this.In the event of a crisis, it must be clear from the outset that the polluter is liable.President!It was a very good white book and not a word from me to the authority.My questions affect the positive list for feed.You are unclear in your white book.What is your schedule, how quickly will you come with a positive list?When are the same requirements for feed and generation placed as in the production and control of the production of food?The last part of my question: When will BSE tests be binding in all member countries?Also there they have remained somewhat unclear in their white book.I would like to thank the commission member for his statements.I think the criteria set for the food authority are a concession to reality.The Member States would not accept an authority with regulatory powers, so such a proposal would therefore have little sense.Some areas of the food industry clearly need better regulation, and this applies in particular to feed.As chair of a committee, which will probably deal almost exclusively with food in the next three years, I have to ask the following question: If Europe, as you said, has the safest food control system, what do we need 24 new guidelines and regulations and 20 new guidelines to change guidelines?Secondly: Will this not increase the problem of over -regulation by Brussels and the lack of implementation by the Member States?To expand: How do the commission's plans for the involvement of the candidates to be included in the debate about these new laws, especially since the Commission clearly assumes that the laws provided for in the white book will be part of the common acquis?Mr President, first of all I would like to thank Ms. Ahern, Ms. Roth-Behrendt and Ms. Jackson for her support for the white book.I find that encouraging, and I look forward to further discussions with you and other MPs of Parliament on the topics mentioned therein.Ms. Ahern asked about liability.This question is not expressly dealt with in the white book.It is only mentioned that we will make regulations regarding traceability.There are already some of them.Then we can devote ourselves to the problem of liability.Despite my own background, I have not yet dealt with problems with the question of liability, but I believe that subsidiarity may play a role here.But I have taken note of your proposal and will check this question again.Ms. Roth-Behrendt asked about the positive list.We will deal with this topic in the appendix to the legal regulation.It is intended to set up a positive list for feed.There is currently a negative list, so to speak, that is completed if necessary.The establishment of the positive list is one of the measures for which an appointment is mentioned in the appendix, and this will be in 2002.The quick warning system for feed is one of the points that, in our opinion, represent a weak point in food law.There is a quick warning system for food, but not for feed.It's a shame, and that's wrong.Regulations must be made to close this gap, and that will also happen.	de
In addition, the Commission member Bolkestein will meet the Parliament Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee next Monday to hear Parliament. The studies were sent to the relevant committee in September 1999, as well as to those who have requested them and are always available to those members of the Parliament. These studies can be found on the Commission's website. I am sure that a member of the Commission Bolkeste will pay the necessary attention to all the considerations made by Parliament. The Mr President, the Commission, is strongly convinced that it is necessary to make a new proposal to further develop the postal industry. In addition, presenting the proposal constitutes a legal obligation. I can confirm that the Commission member Bolkestein has a strong intention to submit such a proposal to the Commission so that it would then be transferred to Parliament and the Council by the end of the first half -year of the year. The Commission is strongly striving to implement the agreed next step, which begins on January 1, 2003. The proposal takes into account the studies conducted, and in particular the need to ensure universal services, the development of consumer -efficient forms of protection, creating a positive atmosphere for new jobs and solving competitions. With the help of the new technologies throughout the Union's postal services, the importance of the market opening is also considered by taking into account the potential benefits of the market as a whole. When presenting the proposal, it takes into account the views that have been presented by Member States, Parliament, Service Users, General Services, their competitors and other relevant entities with whom there have been thorough consultations. The aim is to guarantee good operations in the internal market of the postal services for the benefit of consumers and companies in the European Union as a whole. Mr President, old, time -lived monopolies, are still allowed to operate in the mail industry because there is no competition in that field. In the absence of an operational commission, the situation has been for far too long. The EU Competition Authority has intervened in all other areas. We have been waiting for the Commission's proposal for 18 months. Today, I would like to get an answer from the Commission to the following question: When will we get a modern postal system that could come into force throughout the EU? One of the most important principles of the EU is that we have a common internal market. We are currently working hard to expand it so that it will cover more Member States in the future. It sets efficiency requirements and efficiency requires competition. More and more areas are required to dismantle and release regulation. The EU often leads this activity. The Commission promotes development exemplary. The Commission does this because we have a great deal of experience that old monopolies do not meet the requirements of well -functioning services required by modern society. It also works to stay involved in technical development. The Commission is also doing so in order to calculate prices - all of this makes it fully convinced that goals are more easily achieved in the free market market. After all, things are in many different fields - unfortunately only the postal operation has so far deviated greatly from it. This is hardly because customers are happy. Everyone knows that criticizing price increases and delaying postal distribution are constant topics of discussion. If we really want a working internal market, we cannot constantly consider the Post's operation as an exception. Many states have already begun to release competition in the postal sector. The most advanced is the Netherlands, Finland and Sweden. During the 1990s, these countries have shown that many benefits can be achieved. In Sweden, this development has also taken place in a significant political consensus. It is important that such development is allowed to continue and that it will receive the necessary encouragement. Experience has shown that old monopolies do not meet the requirements of a well -functioning service that customers have the right to demand. Just before the start of this discussion, those who supported the monopoly launched a letter.	fi
There are many haiders in Europe. There is a haider - to only mention a small example - as happened in Rome last week, when the mayor's consent of the mayor are deported without distinction of Bosnian gypsy refugees, sending them by force again to places where conflicts are raging without their children. They are persecuted without even giving them the time to wear something, by graduating from school children born in Italy, and have now been integrated and loved by their classmates at school. One turns into a haider when, in Rome, right -wing opposition parties and the new center push the population to hatred and forbid the municipality from giving up space to the Gypsies in protected places, with water and light. And I say this without in any way accepting the illegal activities of many gypsies and immigrants. I would like to be able to share with everyone and all the feeling that in our countries no one is a stranger. That is why I particularly support the proposals contained in the resolutions: to give strength and reinforcement to all these actions that apply a culture of cohabitation and citizenship. Mr President, I would like to focus above all aspects of the Belder exhibition that is a good analysis of the current situation in the countries' candidates. As far as these countries are concerned, and this has already been said, we should avoid the impression that we are demanding from them more stringent criteria than those of us. We must not compare the real conditions there with our flawless legal texts but with our own realities. Otherwise the candidate countries would get a lower and lower score. It is certainly indisputable that the countries that wish to join and which have regained their independence just before, such as Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia, that these countries have the right to re -define their own national identity and express it. Since the communist dictatorship that made these states suffer in the past did not naturally promote the cultivation of the pluralistic dialogue, today it seems to us that some forms of expression of national identity are excessive or are indirectly addressed against minorities in these countries or against it. We should not condemn these phenomena in advance, using haughty ethics, as much as transient phenomena in the course of these countries for their self -determination. On the contrary, in their path to the EU we should provide them with the required specific assistance so that this necessary self -determination does not mainly be made through a negative demarcation against minorities and neighboring countries. I will refer to the situation in Estonia and Latvia as an example of positive developments between two groups of populations, which are in no way self -evident. It is not self -evident, taking into account the historical burden of these populations by the illegal possession of their territories, the violent movement of their populations, the politically targeted transfer of other populations to these states and the oppression of any national self -determination by the end of the 80's.	el
Criminal action is within the competence of Member States. Because both legal aspects often overlap, and since the offense of the Union's budget, which is also committed by organized crime, is increasing throughout Europe, the competence between Member States is unclear. In addition, there will be differences in individual national provisions, as well as lengthy and even non -implemented mutual legal aid requests. Nor was this the European Council, signed by the European Council in 1995, on the protection of financial interests, nor afterwards. The entry into force of the Agreement requires that all 15 Member States ratify it. So far, only four Member States have done it in five years. This stagnation that threatens to weaken the credibility of the Union has made Parliament propose to establish a European General Prosecutor's Office. It is by no means intended to create a supranational criminal and procedural system. Rather, the aim is to provide the Union with special tools to protect its financial interests in accordance with the principle of subsidiary. With today's report, we will revive this idea and demand that the Commission proposes billing proposals for this goal. In this context, it is also discussed in its entirety of the matters presented in the statements of the Committee on Legal and Internal Market Affairs, civil liberties and rights, and the Committee on the Committee. We make two recommendations that are the result of Olaf's establishment and are expected to ensure its functional and legal efficiency and transparency and the protection of individual rights. For this, we need - this is the first recommendation - a legal text that takes into account the offenses that damage the Union's financial interests and to which have the basic principles. In one review proposal, I stipulate that the Commission will be granted time to draw up a proposal until September 30. The second recommendation applies to the criminal proceedings. The Commission should - and in this respect, have changed the deadline until May 31, 2000 - proposes an independent body under the Commission's institutional responsibility, which includes the proposal for the establishment of Olaf's investigation and the control of Olaf. The existing control system can only monitor the independence of the Agency's Director. Such a proposal for a regulation should include the independence of this body and to determine the tasks that are limited to the internal investigation and legal action of Olaf's financial interests and its relations with national authorities. This still does not affect the law of the Member States. The Court of Justice is to be responsible for the control of the legality of action. In addition, we encourage the future inter -governmental conference to set up a European General Prosecutor's Office, which is intended to protect the financial interests of the Union, in accordance with the potential research and, in the meantime, a widely recognized collection of Corpus Juris, and the chances of implementing the Corpus Juris. Additional support for this project is also provided in another report of the Expert Committee. The Commission, the Commission members Barnier and Vitorino, as well as a few Member States, are also open to this idea. I ask you, good colleagues, to accept this report, which has been approved by a large majority of the budget control committee. In this respect, we can again act as a trendsetter so that Parliament is active in preventing poor economic care, and especially fraud, and to punish where it is necessary..(ES) Mr President, I am pleased to use the speech in the debate on this report and congratulate the presenter Theato. I believe that cooperation between the committees has worked very well with this report and that the end result we are dealing with today is a moderate and clear report on a particularly sensitive issue. Moderation and clarity are needed, especially in the development of Article 280 (4). Namely, if we had to reward the most difficult, most unclear and mixed article - how we want to call it -, competition would undoubtedly be very equal, as the establishment agreement is a treasure trove of complex articles, but the article I mentioned is undoubtedly one of the best candidates for that prize.	fi
It is she who is competent in terms of technical security against false coinage.As we have already pointed out, the Commission presented in the summer of 1998 a communication drawing up the list of all areas where measures are required, namely the field of information, the field of permanent training -an important point -, the field of cooperation between the states of the euro zone and of naturally cooperation beyond this simple framework and in the field of criminal measures.This is what it is in the framework decision subject to your exam.Madam Rapporteur, I would like to thank you very sincerely on behalf of the Commission and, before anything else, I also thank Parliament for having been able to develop an opinion in such a short time.I attach a Grand Prix to it.In the framework decision, it is a question of ensuring that the member states use the definition of false coinage crimes.Having the same definitions is obviously the essential condition for reacting in the same way everywhere, because, as we have already pointed out, it is essentially to ensure that the euro will be protected even before being physically put into circulation.Of course, the Commission is also grateful to Parliament for having made its decision quickly -I hope that the text will be adopted just as quickly -which now allows the entry into force of the framework decision as soon as possible.As a result, implementation measures may be incurred.The Commission is now invited to present, during the first half of next year, a report on the implementation of the framework decision in the Member States, so that the importance of the subject is reflected in adequate actions.It has been noted that this framework decision is precisely criminal law.It is therefore advisable to recognize this innovation, this advance, even if Mr. Schulz pointed out that by completing this fairly old convention, the advance of which is rather timid.To the question asked whether the Commission is of the opinion that the framework decision is based on a legal basis sufficiently solid in accordance with the Treaty, the Commission is of the opinion that the applied legal basis is the right one.However, the framework decision must then be supplemented by other laws of law.The Commission will propose a proposal for the cooperation of all the competent authorities and on cooperation with Europol.This proposal must provide for a duty of cooperation and must also force the national authorities to report the cases of counterfeiting to Europol and to subject the counterfeit money to the ECB for identification and classification, which will make it possible to take effective measures in this area.As for the question of coordinating the various measures, since 1998, the Commission - and subsequently the OLAF - has worked with the experts of the Member States, the BCE and Europol, in order, in advance, effectively fight against the counterfeiting of euros.For its part, the Commission has already presented - as noted Mr. Karas - a campaign proposal on the Euro whose proposed budget is still rising to 32 million euros.This is an amount that can be spent in a judicious manner, a substantial amount.This campaign will of course focus on the security of the euro in the face of the false coinage.	fr
Consequently, any proposal suggesting a major reform of the system for applying the competition policy must be carefully examined.The truth is that the single market is not yet completed.During the six months that I spent as a deputy within this parliament, I became fully aware of the determination of many deputies to promote what is called the European project.We intend to say daily that we must promote a broader and deeper Europe.However, in reality, all this is from rhetoric in view of national, regional and local obstacles which continue to hinder the functioning of a real European single market.It is in this context that I want to assess the commission's proposals.I would like to say clearly that we grant the greatest confidence to Commissioner Monti and that we respect him deeply.We consider that he is the appropriate man to dismantle the cartels.However, he must recognize, like everyone else, that his specific proposals should be assessed and subject them to a rigorous examination, a work accomplished by our rapporteur of the Economic and Monetary Commission, Mr. Von Wogau.I would like to congratulate him, in his absence unfortunately, for the exhaustive and meticulous way in which he undertook the preparation of his report - as well as for having supported me, as a source of constant irritation!He mentioned earlier the fact that the report was adopted by a large majority but without my support.Although I do not share his conclusions, I believe that he illustrated, in his report, a large number of questions that the commission must take care of.First, the possibility of renationalization of competition policy.I know that the Commission is not favorable there but the possibility exists.I remain worried about the capacity of the jurisdictions and national competitions in matters of competition.I remain worried about the entire operation concerning the judicial process.I asked Commissioner Monti a few days ago what would happen if he was wrong and that a renationalization really took place.Mr. Von Wogau declares that we can turn to the European Court.Well, in Great Britain, that's what we are doing for the moment.We see that the European Court is not able to set provisional measures with regard to a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, for which we have the support of the European Commission.Unless it is estimated that this constitutes a purely nationalist argument, the European Court took ten years to render a judgment with regard to the Factortame affair, in which the British government was the defendant.So, from a judicial point of view, measures should be taken.I ask the Commission what can be undertaken to accelerate the implementation in this particular area.As for legal certainty, I approve of the argument put forward by Ms. Thyssen.It is important that companies enjoy legal certainty.I said it again to Mr. Monti recently.He said we shouldn't always have lawyers.	fr
"Finally, it should be remembered that the real solution of the comitology problems for the European Parliament in any case and in principle in the change in the procedure provided for the implementation of the regulations and the gradual abolition of the committees, the existence of which is an abnormality, by which the authority authority of the Commission is severely restricted and the legislative law of the European Parliament can be impaired.President, dear colleagues!Comitology is a term with which most people cannot do anything, and very few people know what is meant by it.It is reminiscent of secret and conspiracies, and so it was earlier.However, there is nothing else behind it than the determination of the modalities for the exercise of the implementation powers assigned to the Commission.The modalities of these implementation powers consist of a limited number of committee proceedings.Until the Treaty of Amsterdam, there were around 20 variations of this committee procedure, which did not contribute to the clarity of the legislation or for transparency for the citizens.On the contrary, even the European Parliament was not even informed for a long time.The first progress in the fight for more transparency in this committee jungle was for the European Parliament in being informed at least about what the European Commission intends to regulate in the context of these various committees.This was done in 1988 as part of the correspondence in Plumb/Delor.Another step towards transparency and participation of the European Parliament was the so -called Vivendi mode on September 20, 1994, in which not only the information was granted to the parliament, but also a certain way of objection.The parliament also received control options.With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation has improved significantly in that the number of committee proceedings - as the European Parliament had long demanded - was drastically limited to three procedures, namely the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure.The information and control rights granted to the European Parliament in the past must now be again stipulated by an interinstitutional agreement according to Amsterdam's contract.Our rapporteur, Ms. Frassoni, has done a very careful work and showed which questions are clarified within the framework of this interinstitutional agreement and which administrative procedures within the parliament may have to be changed.A main problem is the time factor.If the European Parliament is informed, it usually has to comment within a very short period of four weeks if it wishes.In the event of questions that affect the health and security of people in the European Union, the European Commission must be able to react very shortly, if necessary, within a few hours or days, as a guardian of the contracts and the only institution that is entitled to initiative rights.Nevertheless, the law of the European Parliament must remain preserved on information and, if necessary, reaction.For these difficulties, our rapporteur shows very useful solutions that I can only fully support with my faction.I only have one request.In the German text of section 2, a little misleaded, and I urgently ask for clarification, even afterwards by those who are responsible for the pressure.Instead of ""must be continued"" in my opinion, ""must be preserved"" should be called."	de
This proposal is in stark contrast to the current system, in which criminal law and criminal proceedings as the heart of the national legal systems fall under the sovereignty of every people and the exclusive jurisdiction of each state.In contrast, the idea of ​​a European public prosecutor's office aims to push the states into a subordinate role in the long term.In addition, this slope would result in an absolutely unpredictable chain of reforms.According to the Theato report, the European public prosecutor's office would primarily be necessary to guide the investigations of the Olaf Office for Fraud Control.At the same time, however, the report from Van Hulten, who is advised today, can be learned that the European public prosecutor in turn should be monitored by a court of the European Union.This can hide a large reform behind a small European reform and a medium reform.Apart from the fact that a huge reform can be hidden behind the large reform, because soon you will be a European criminal law and why not then propose a European Minister of Justice that would be controlled by an expansion of the powers of the European Parliament.In my opinion, you should think well about the power weight that could be disturbed if one suggests such an apparently punctual reform.Ultimately, it becomes clear that suggestions such as the inability for a European public prosecutor reveal the inability to Europe differently than pyramidal and centralized, i.h.to present in the form of a super state.In contrast, the Group of Europe of the Nations is aiming for a Europe that is poly -centered and in which the nations are networked.As a result of such networking, for example, a better coordination between the national courts and possibly the formation of national structures that specialize in violations of the damage to community finances would be conceivable.The legal framework already exists.It is in order in principle and should only be perfected.President, Ms. Theato, suggests an institutional revolution for two reasons.The public, the 20 million unemployed and thousands of cows affected by the beef madness indifferent, should be worried due to the fraud that allegedly endangering financial interests.And these two reasons should justify a double instrument: a European Criminal Code for violations of community law and a European Attorney General.Ms. Theato probably forgot to mention a European prison because the FBI, the European police, already exists with Olaf.The whole should be regulated by two regulations, one for the prosecutor, one for the criminal code that is to be passed on the basis of Article 280 of the contract, i.e.h.According to the derived right, because one of the special features of the derived right is that it allows all the absurdities.We are dealing with a double absence.First of all, there is the classic, euro -fermentation ideological absurdity: a uniform market, a uniform VAT, uniform diplomacy, a uniform army and now a uniform criminal law and a uniform public prosecutor.And all of this to fight frauds that make up less than a billion, while the APS, the free trade zones or customs gifts on Chiquita are thrown out of the window many times over and, as a result of the household rationing package, another billions from the fourth source of income, GDP, are lost.	de
Has anyone got a job? How many have got a job last and last year unless you can answer this year? What has happened to education? Are these famous vocational training centers exist for the employment of trainers or trainees? Are there some figures? So do we have the opportunity to somehow monitor what is happening in the employment policy of the Greek government? Mr Papayannakis, Member of Parliament, I can only answer that the Greek government must actually summarize its efforts to create an electronic statistical cataloging system in order to provide quantitative results from the programs to be implemented and to follow the follow -up of the policies. There has been an improvement in the employment figures in Greece and, in my view, the same in productivity. What the Commission can do is related to concrete guidelines. As you know, the guidelines that are evaluated for each country are 22. They apply to access to education, the proportions and special measures of men and women in the long -term unemployed. For all these concrete guidelines, the Commission will try to quantify the information and obtain concrete material on the basis of the implementation of the new Community Framework Program 2000-2006. Question # 36 (H-0782/99): Subject: The Danish premature retirement arrangement Can the Commission declare whether it has approved the entire Danish premature pension arrangement, and are there any other disagreement between Denmark and the Commission? According to Efterløn, the Danish pension system, only those who live in Denmark and meet the required working hours can be obtained. There are employees who have appealed to the Commission because they are not entitled to retirement. Danish authorities believe that community law does not oblige them to pay employees a prior pension when they do not meet the requirements of the Danish law. It should be noted that the current regulation on social security systems does not currently mention premature pensions, and the Commission has proposed some changes to the regulation, which, however, is now dependent on the Council. Until now, there has been no case -law of the European Court of Justice for Efterløn, but it could reasonably be argued that the preliminary conditions of residence do not comply with the current general clauses in force, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of the origin. The Commission departments have launched a procedure for meetings and meetings with the Danish Board to find a common language and approach. The latest meeting on this issue was in November 1999 and we are looking forward to the final proposals of the departments as to whether a violation of Denmark will be launched. I paid attention to the fact that a member of the Commission did not give any direct answer to the question of whether the Commission had approved the entire Danish premature pension arrangement, but indirectly it turned out that the answer was negative. I would like to ask a member of the Commission to clearly confirm that the Commission does not accept the arrangement. In addition, a member of the Commission more than hinted at the Commission seriously considering taking the issue of the entire Danish premature pension arrangement to the Luxembourg court, precisely because it is a real oppressive of non-Danish wage earners who do not meet the Danish arrangement. I would like to ask a member of the Commission if he could give some kind of summary time limits in this matter, as this problem is to be solved in a social policy debate in Denmark. Therefore, I would be grateful if a member of the Commission could clarify this question. Member of Parliament, I would like to emphasize that both Denmark and many other countries have problems with interpretation of directives and problems when transferring directives to national law. This is such a case, and at this stage there will be discussions between the Danish government and the Commission to find the best solution that benefits workers who meet the terms and which are entitled to this pension. I would continue to be briefly from the latter thing. I urge the Commission to make it completely clear that the dissenting views of the Commission do not in any way violate the right of Danish citizens from the system, but that the Commission simply seeks to ensure that the system applies to all EU citizens to which it has the right to under Community law.	fi
The great displacement campaign of the Serbs could be stopped, but almost every day there are unacceptable incidents where people are killed where people are prevented from living there and living as they want.Every day there are attacks on Serbs, Roma, on Bosnier, but there are still attacks on Albanians.The report actually made me startled when he is true that an Albanian doctor who certainly worked in the Hospital in Mitrovic in the Serbian part ultimately gave it up to be there for his population in this hospital because his life was repeatedly threatened.These are incidents and situations that we cannot tolerate.I hear - whether it is true or not, I don't know - that the Serbs still operate a mine in Kosovo, in the Serbian part.There are at least rumors that Serbian militias are still active.For me it is irrelevant whether it is a Serb, a Roma, a Bosnian or an Albanian who is threatened or killed in Kosovo.For me it is irrelevant who is working towards a division and separation in Kosovo.It is crucial for me that the organs we finance achieve what we want to achieve, namely a multi -ethnic Kosovo, a coexistence in Kosovo.We need more police, there is absolutely not enough police.We need an independent judiciary - certainly difficult to build - we also need funds for the high commissioner for human rights.All of this has to happen, and quickly.If we do not help quickly, the situation deteriorates and there may be new conflicts and crisis situations.So I think it is correct that we acted quickly, that we have given urgency that we provide the money.Only, we want to see the actions, and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I ask the Commission to make sure that this money is also used successfully, in particular to expand the police and to build the judiciary.President!First of all, many thanks to the ladies and men and especially the rapporteur for the speed you dealt with this topic.This will undoubtedly enable us to quickly instruct funds for Kosovo and to counteract the concerns that both Mr. Swoboda and Ms. Pack have expressed.In the pronunciation tonight, I think I can see three types of main worries.First: Although we have progressed far, we could mention customs administration, bank management, tax administration, it is true that we have to go forward further.Forward to finance what?Here we have a first little disagreement.In some of their amendments, they require that the type of facilities are being tightered to which the Union's financing contribution refers.For example in amendments 3 and 5. But after our perception, in both aspects of the administration of the United Nations, which knows the reality better than we do, a greater scope of maneuver should be left.We believe that the intended determination of the resources at the moment would create more practical difficulties.	de
"One should not forget that in 1999 there were 717,000 that came to compensate for our low birth rate.Therefore, an immigration policy with social consciousness is essential in the social order, as President Gutierres recently explained in Spain.It is necessary to take special consideration of the situation of those who are threatened or weakened in terms of economic changes, mergers, mergers, takeovers, new technologies, etc.Here, an educational policy for the ability and preparation for new jobs is imperative to secure existing employment or to have a second chance, because sometimes the postman rings twice, as the film title says.I just believe that it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that it rings several times.I mean, Ms. Commissioner, that the Commission is responsible for promoting and coordinating these opportunities.Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Andersson on his really excellent work - that's why there is also extensive agreement - and thank the ladies and men for their contributions.Let me make some remarks about the explanations that have already been heard.First, I would like to emphasize that the debate about social protection between the European organs was admitted a few years ago.In 1995 there was a first message entitled: ""The Future of Social Protection"", reports of the European Parliament, by Ms. Weiler and Mr. Pronk.Today we treat Mr. Andersson's report.In my opinion, we have made a lot of progress, especially since we are already debating on the modernization of social protection.Second, it is important to take into account the legal basis on which the European Commission can work.As is well known, the contract does not result in a legal basis for politics at European level, but there is also an agreement, which is also confirmed at the last council, that measures to coordinate and exchange experiences and successful programs should be initiated among the Member States.Third, I point out that the four goals that the present report focuses on, namely the paid work, the economic sustainability of the pension systems, social integration, and finally the quality of health care, a horizontal approach is pursued with regard to equality issues, because as part of the categories mentioned by women and men, there are special programs tailored to women.It is often necessary to tackle the problems with special policies.Next I would like to take into account the specific steps that we have initiated.As is well known, a high -ranking working group was already used by the Portuguese presidency, which will present their first report at the summit in June.The Portuguese presidency will primarily deal with the two questions in the long term safe pension systems and social integration.In my opinion, the proposal to set up a corresponding contact group at parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute to the fact that after this high -ranking working group has been approved.Several speakers have commented on the role of social protection systems, the costs of social protection and the influence of these systems on the competitiveness of the Member States.I would like to say that with the help of the political attempts to link competitiveness and social cohesion in Europe."	de
With all respect for the Gothenburg protocol - even if it has borrowed its name from the city from where I come from - I must say that this protocol cannot be compared to the directive for which we will decide tomorrow. One can, of course, wonder why the Commission's directive is presented just a month later, about something like a punishment for this UN directive, but this is due to our own slow pace of the issue and not something else. If we were moving a little faster, this directive would be ready and complete long before the so -called Gothenburg protocol. They characterize the directive impossible, but I would say that the situation we are in today is impossible. So the problem lies in the current situation and not in the directive. Mr President, I congratulate Mrs Myller, who I know has drawn this report after much and difficult thought. It seems to me that the discussion is summarized in the following question: Do we believe that the Gothenburg protocol was the best that Member States can realistically achieve? I recognize that the Commission and the environmental groups believe that much more can be done in practice, but despite all these Member States have pledged to significantly reduce air pollution - though this is not true for everything. Some Member States appear to have participated in the negotiations by making few calculations on the back of a file and refused to compromise in any way to establish realistic goals. Others did not even use the same methodology, the same basis for calculations as the rest. Therefore, in many ways the protocol is essentially. It offers us no confidence at all. It is a Tsapatsouli political compromise and nothing more. I do not know what more the Commissioner can achieve, but we should seek reductions in air pollution and support her in her efforts to negotiate them. We should support this report and the Commissioner herself.) Honorable Mr President, my colleague Myller has prepared a very good report and our team believes that we need to move far beyond the Gothenburg protocol. The preparation of this directive has apparently entered national auction and the end result is very moderate if we consider what the real challenges are. In any case, however, it is important that the European Parliament now supports at least the policy chosen by the Commission. The Greens Group / European Free Alliance proposes to set even more stringent goals for 2010 than those proposed by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. We want to emphasize that a comprehensive policy to reduce emissions should be implemented. It should be reminded that in any case we are before the implementation of the goals of the Cyrus Protocol, which expressly presupposes the more efficient use of energy or simpler the restriction on its use. Consequently, in our opinion, in our opinion in this directive, the additional benefit arising from the integrated strategy to achieve the objectives of the Directive in this direction should be taken into account.	el
As part of the next resolution of the CIG, Parliament will have to seriously study the question of differentiation and flexibility.Both the enlargement and the results of integration are threatened if we are unable to create the concentric circles system proposed by the Liberal group.My colleagues, Ms. Frassoni and Mr. Onesta, have already expressed themselves, not without a certain skepticism, on certain aspects of the question that occupies us.I would like to share my concerns about subsidiarity, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own autonomous regions.This subject has not received adequate attention and many elements are a source of concern.Allow me to draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement for this parliament.It was decided that Parliament could not reasonably have more than 700 deputies if we wanted it to remain a deliberative assembly.If we apply the current principle of decreasing proportionality, namely 6 seats per member member plus a siege per half-million inhabitants, we already come to a situation where Luxembourg, with its 367,000 inhabitants, has more deputies in this assembly than the country of Galle, which is a partially autonomous United Kingdom region.Scotland, with a population of 5 million inhabitants, currently has 8 seats in this assembly, Denmark and Finland have 16, for the same number of inhabitants.However, what will happen if we maintain the maximum number of deputies in the European Parliament at 700, if we gradually include 26 % more population, and if we then adopt the commission proposal - which I consider little thought - to know that we should have a European list of candidates.What will happen to a region like Scotland, which I represent here?She will become completely invisible!In these circumstances, the deputies of this assembly should not be surprised in the least that the inhabitants of Scotland and other similar countries require, in these discussions, if the enlargement should not consist in the admission of new member states from existing states.This opinion is increasingly widespread in Scotland.Mr. President, if I say that the Union is at a crossroads, I will not be announced anything new.It has been said many times.But this time, it is true: we have launched the single currency extremely positive and we are considering an enlargement.It remains to be seen whether we will be ready at the time of widening or not.Are we going to expand without deepening or will we widen in deepening?This is the debate and this is to what will all discussion on the intergovernmental conference, its agenda and its method will tend to.It is obvious that, for the time being, the Council has not bet on an enlargement accompanied by a deepening.This is dangerous for enlargement, dangerous for any perspective of political union and, above all, difficult to understand for public opinion.The Council must understand that if we want the future of the European Union to go through a solid enlargement, the next intergovernmental conference must go much further.	fr
The matter is serious. I think our institution must react. Mr President, we disappear at the border, and the attitudes and symbols are of great importance when moving. The justice to be shared can be considered to reflect the political community. That's why this report is so important. It is a step forward in the achievement of an area based on freedom, security and, above all, a court -based area, to which we all strive for. Our goal is the natural Union judging system, and today the issue is a significant step in this direction, and it requires mutual trust between the Member States and their legal systems, and the confidence of the Union of Union citizens. However, it is also a prerequisite for taking the subtle of the fundamental freedoms and rights, and in particular the procedure -related guarantees. In this respect, I think Parliament has successfully shaped the Council's presentation and has emphasized and decisively emphasized in all reviews the strengthening of these procedures related to these procedures. Mr President, as the rapporteur said, has focused his attention on one thing with the intention of eliminating it, and I mean listening to telephone. On behalf of the European People's Party, I submitted a resolution to submit the Council to submit to this topic as soon as possible, as the lack of legislation is not a good thing. The legislation was incomplete in the proposed form and therefore bad. However, the lack of legislation can also cause, and we are certainly aware that it often causes abuse in the field of telecommunications. Another thing I wanted to highlight and have also been done for the use of a video meeting applies to the use of a video meeting for those subject to investigation, accused, offenders or those challenged. For this issue, on behalf of the European People's Party, I have asked the Council to submit a agreement as quickly as possible to clarify and honestly supplement unsatisfactory legislation. Mr President, we members of the European People's Party, with a few exceptions, are going to vote in favor of the Commission's reviews and, of course, in favor of the reviews we submit. The Mr President, one part of European construction, is, in our opinion, the construction of a common legal system that includes an administrative court, both material and procedural civil law, and both material and procedural criminal justice that are suitable for Europe. The Convention on Legal Aid, which we discuss today, is only one part in this large European Corpus Juris collection, with a natural basis for human rights and basic freedom. Thus, cooperation in legal and criminal matters must also be practiced in such a way that they are the principles of our culture and society: I now think about equitable trial, especially the right of defense, the neutrality of the judge, and the duration of legal action, for which My home country is unfortunatefor unfinished legal cases. Legislation cannot and should not include restrictions on fundamental rights that are intended to be explained by the fact that they are related to the incident or assumed criminal offending. The report, which has been widely modified by the Committee on Civic Freedom and Rights, compared to the draft originally presented and has accepted several of the amendments we have submitted continues to evoke a certain kind of confusion that is to be regulated by the interception and video conferencing. In recent weeks, we have received information on how modern technology enables listening to be implemented, and for this information we have to pay more attention: we would not wish that the gloomy prospects described by Orwell will become even more cruel and worrying reality. However, this is only the beginning of a significant work in the judicial sector and must proceed at the same pace as the European development we want. Mr President, the plenary session discusses the reviews of the Commission and the political groups. There are no such checks and cannot be presented by an individual member.	fi
The text of the proposal for the regulation has been changed relatively significantly in the fishing committee.All members of our faction voted for these amendments in the committee as well as in the plenary.The text becomes considerably clearer through change application 1.The recorded data is not only intended for scientific purposes.They must be processed by the scientists and then forwarded to the political bodies commissioned with the decision.However, it is of the greatest importance that the recording is scientifically justified.Amendment 2 includes a change in the original commission proposal.The commission's proposal requires the development of very detailed studies for each individual ship and every single company.In addition to the extraordinary cost loads that such a proposal entails, the cumbersome implementation procedures could also cause certain administrations to take these difficulties into an excuse not to make the corresponding information in good time.There is still a risk that additional bureaucratic requirements in this sector will cause the affected people.For the second part of this amendment, it should be said that it is necessary to determine the job losses in this sector much more precisely and to record it in terms of numbers.It should not be forgotten that the implementation of a common fishing policy must also include a social dimension in statistical-analytical terms.Amendment 3 enables the important aspect to be taken into account in recording environmental data.The particularly negative effects of the lack of consideration of such data is e.g.For example, the decision about the ban on driving nets, which is not justified at all, because it is one of the most selective fishing devices.If this ecological dimension is not included in the data collection, the Commission could prohibit the use of this or that fishing device at will.Amendment 4 includes the obligation of the scientists to process all data in this way and to submit the responsible authorities, including the national and regional authorities, that they are helpful for decision -making.The stress contained in the commission proposal is reduced with amendment 5.The responsible authorities may only request information that improve the operational knowledge of fishing activity without demanding that data are disclosed by the right to confidentiality, such as tax information that does not fall within the area of ​​responsibility of the community.Among the commission in the procedure and monitoring of the procedure causes a more binding design of this article.It is necessary that all data is transmitted annually and the Commission regularly informs about the aggregated results.Change application 7 Finally, the Commission obliges to submit a report by the end of 2001.Since the common fishing policy is to be redesigned in 2002, all political managers must have the information that forms the basis of the commission proposal.Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000) The change in the directive submitted by the Commission is important because it deals with a special contagious virus disease, the infectious anemia of salmon.This is transmitted in the water via organic substances such as blood, faeces, mucus, etc.A vertical transmission of the disease by spawning or milk has not been scientifically proven.However, it is known that other species such as trout, eels or herring can carry the virus without developing it.	de
"We therefore believe that a more realistic date should be found in the mediation process.We voted against the amendments 25 and 72, in which a minimal anthropogenic pollution of the entire groundwater is required.We consider this requirement to be unrealistic in view of the immense costs and the extremely long periods for the restoration of an almost unloaded state.This is the reason for our vote decision.Water is a renewable and limited natural resource, the sensible use of which is of essential importance.The framework directive on water policy will represent an important cornerstone of community policy in this sector.The goals of this guideline are clear and ambitious.We agree to these goals.The guideline determines environmental limits close to zero.In our view, however, it would make more sense not to write unrealistic deadlines that neither our states nor our industry can comply with.Of course we need a schedule, but it must be more staggered.The legal obligation to achieve zero emissions and to stop the introductions by 2020 would be a ban on all identified substances.Such provisions could pose major problems with regard to the cross -border catchment areas, and with regard to the accessible countries, they could make the expansion difficult.Of course, I would also like to address a special sector here, the development of which I pursue very precisely, namely agriculture, which is one of the largest water consumers.She has to - and she already begins - accept her role as a paying environmental sinner, but at the same time you also have to take into account her peculiarities and constraints, especially in the dry regions of the world.As far as the change applications regarding the radioactive substances, I am of course for controls, but this question depends on the legal basis regulated in the Euratom contract.Report Andersson (A5-0033/2200) The EDD faction could not support the Anderson report.In the reasoning (page 15), among others.recognized: ""The different levels of development and traditions of the Member States in the area of ​​social security prevent uniform harmonization of social security systems in the Member States"".However, the term ""uniform harmonization"" is one of those confused names that fully disguise the relevant integration process.It is also correct, as it says in the reason that a harmonization is harmful: ""A harmonization would also be harmful, since this would make higher demands on weaker member states and at the same time more socially developed countries could be put under pressure in terms of competitive states.Harmonization - goes out.In point D it is emphasized that ""the Union can ensure added value by accepting real binding and effective convergence criteria"", and in the following it is pointed out in the report that the development of this convergence process is promoted by consulting between the ecoofin council and the Council of Social and Labor Minister.Finally, point 7 emphasizes that ""the social process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious tax coordination"".Here we approach the core of the matter.This project of social harmonization is not a social policy, rather it is a continuation of the EU WWU project."	de
(The session is interrupted at 11.50 a.m. for a solemn meeting on the occasion of the visit of Mr. Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic, and re-accepted at 12.50 p.m.. Voting (continued) according to the agenda follows the coordination of Ms. Stenzel's report on the Equal initiative (A5-0034/2000).(The parliament accepts the motion for resolution.) Recommendation for the second reading: Report (A5-0027/2000) by Ms. Lienemann on behalf of the Committee on Environmental Questions, Popular Health and Consumer Policy regarding the common point of view of the council with regard to the issuance of the guideline of the European Parliament and the Council for creating an administrative framework for measures in the area of ​​water policy(9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067 (COD)) Before the vote: I welcome the quality and ambition of this report on the subject of life.I would like to briefly remind you that Life is a financial instrument in the service of environmental policies within the European Union and in the third countries, both in the neighboring Mediterranean countries as well as in the Baltic Sea residents or in accession countries.The committee for environmental issues, public health and consumer policy has submitted numerous amendments that were largely included in the joint view adopted by the Council.In the third phase of Life (2000-2004), this instrument is divided into three focus areas: Life-Natur (47 %of resources), Life Umwelt (47 %) and Life third countries (6 %).In my opinion, these are the most important changes: the contribution of Life to the sustainable development in the community and to the development of communal policy in the environmental area, in particular with regard to the integration of the environment into the other policies, and the implementation and the revision of the legal provisions in the environmental sector;the improvement of efficiency, transparency and the methodology of the procedures for the implementation of life, the procedures for the information of the citizens and the distribution among the population and the procedures for cooperation between the beneficiaries;The goal of Life: This program is primarily intended to aim at sustainable urban development, in close coordination with the pilot projects realized as part of the Urban initiative, and I already had the opportunity to report on this initiative;The contribution of the funded projects to the sustainability of the socio -economic measures and consequently to the creation of jobs.In my opinion, it is essential that the financial instrument Life continues to enable the accession countries from Central and Eastern Europe.The other accession candidates (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey or Malta) will also be able to take part in Life as soon as appropriate agreements have been concluded with these countries.The main problem in the negotiations with the Council is of course the amount of the total amount, which is intended for the third phase of the Life (2000-2004) program.The Commission's proposal, which was approved by the Council, is 613 million euros, while the committee for environmental issues believes that the corresponding budget would have to include 850 million euros.I support the determined attitude of the rapporteur.The financial equipment in question has not been increased since the introduction of this program, not even when expanding the EU to 15 Member States.If the report in the plenum is passed, a mediation procedure must be initiated, as is intended in the co -decision procedure in order to clarify the question of the funds provided for this program.This type of procedure is common practice, since the programs or legislative projects have too often a household that does not meet the requirements!	de
Until now, the Commission has only experienced a relative success in reimbursement of the funds unjustly collected.Criminal measures are the competence of the Member States.Since at present, these two legal aspects overlap and that the Union budget damage increases on the cross -border level - and are also the result of organized crime -, the distribution of skills between the Member States is not clear.In addition, there are differences between the national legal provisions and requests for legal mutual aid which drag in length or are left unanswered.The Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests of European Communities, signed by the European Council in 1995, and the two protocols relating to it did not change anything.To enter into force, this agreement must be ratified by each of the fifteen Member States.After five years, only four have done so.This inaction, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, led Parliament to call for the creation of a European public prosecutor.In doing so, there is no question of creating a transnational criminal and judicial order.The objective is rather to provide the union with specific instruments aimed at the protection of its financial interests, in compliance with subsidiarity.By this report, we rekindle this idea and initiate the Commission to present legislative proposals to make this objective materialize.In this area, the requests that emerge from the opinions of the Legal Commission and the Internal Market and the Commission for Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs are fully taken into account.We express two recommendations which arise from the creation of Olaf and should guarantee its operational and legal effectiveness, its transparency and the protection of individual freedoms.To this end, we need - first recommendation - of a legal act which anchors the crimes undermining the financial interests of the Union and the guiding principles.In an amendment proposal, I recommend setting the period at the end of which the Commission will have to advance its proposal to September 30.The second recommendation concerns criminal procedure.The Commission should propose - and, there too, I propose by way of fixing the deadline for May 31, 2000 - a legal act on the creation of an independent organization, linked to the Commission on the institutional level, and responsible for coordinating and controlling the regularity of the OLAF inquiry activities.The existing supervisory committee can only control the independence of the director of the office.Such a proposal should contain an independent status for this organization and define its tasks which are limited to investigations and internal proceedings of OLAF in matters of involvement in the financial interests of the Union as well as to its relations with the national authorities.He remains excluded to influence justice within the Member States.Control of the legality of acts must be provided by the Court of Justice.In addition, we call the next intergovernmental conference to begin the debate on the creation of a European public prosecutor responsible for the protection of the Union's financial interests, if possible on the basis of the now widely recognized study which was produced by renowned specialists, the famous Corpus Juris, as well as feasibility studies that have followed it.	fr
B5-0272 / 2000 Schröder and other Greens / European Free Alliance Group;B5-0278/2000 Salafranca Sánchez Neyra and other European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democratic Group in Western Sahara. Mr President, we have been asking for several years in Parliament for several years, first of all, to follow the resolution of the United Nations;Secondly, the fact that the European Union, the Commission and the Council, would be more involved in solving the problem of Western Sahara;Thirdly, even though we vote for this resolution, which I think is a good unanimous resort asking again for self -evident things, I might have formulated some aspects a little differently in it. I refer to the statement that each party, Morocco and West Sahara, must be done to resolve the conflict. We believe that we have to invoke Morocco more strongly and ask it to put all of their political will to resolve the conflict, as the Western Saws have shown countless times that they want to finally end the conflict. They have released prisoners and accepted what the United Nations have said about potential voters;That is, the Moroccan government is the one who has put the sticks in this conflict in the solving of the conflict. The latest obstacle that has postponed the referendum for how long time was that 76,000 complaints of the voters who may have been approved for the Western Sahara referendum to the referendum. If you continue to put the staples in the stroller, we may need to be responsible for the outbreak of a more serious conflict. Some are horrified by the fact that the Western Ghases say again that if it is not given any other option, it may be transmitted again to weapons. I'm not terrifying this. I understand them;It is a solution that no one wants, but which we force them to do. The Mr President, the European Union and the Parliament is in this respect, to be impaired to avoid the outbreak of a new conflict in the area, which is already quite flammable. We do not want, the President of the West Saw will become another East Timor. Mr President, Mr Members of the Parliament, certain things make Western Sahara's situation very timely and they are very well suited to tonight. The first of these is the urgent resolution issued by the United Nations Security Council on February 29, where it was decided to continue the Minurso term until the end of May. The second is a critical nutritional situation in the desert camps of Western Haastoan refugees. Serious recent events must also be mentioned in the occupied areas of Western Sahara, where the Moroccan authorities have suppressed demonstrations for referendum. We also have to mention the visit of the Magreb delegation to Morocco next week and the willingness of the Moroccan King to make its first visit to the West Sahara area next week. The unstable situation in this African continent may have detrimental effects on some particularly remote areas of the community, such as the Canary Islands, and many of us citizens want a peaceful solution to the Western Sahara situation and that the people of Western Sahara can maintain a free, open and impotent referendum. Finally, one of the goals of the European Union's foreign and security policy is to preserve peace and strengthen international security. Therefore, it would be appropriate for the YUTP's high representative to SOLANAN to act more actively to give the people of Western Sahara to be adequately guaranteed by actively present and directly attending the different stages of the peace process and referendum. Therefore, we are in favor of a resolution. Mr President, first of all, it is important to emphasize our concern on behalf of the Western Sahara people, a people who have lived for many years in conditions that have often been marked by exile and suffering. In order to solve this problem of the people, it is important to follow the timetable for the referendum, which has already been deferred time and time again. In other words, it will certainly be postponed again, which would lead to a serious worsening of the situation.	fi
First, indirect tax provisions;Recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, direct provisions and, in particular, the code of good conduct.This system has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca, time passes and it is necessary to adapt the regulations that we have applied to date to new circumstances.In this regard, I noticed an important consensus in all interventions.First, it is necessary to define clear and complete standards in terms of the development of the regulations.The existence of confused rules, normative voids or rules which only devote indeterminate legal concepts is probably more shocking in this part of the regulations than in others.And this, all the more as is the case in the second part of the reform that is recommended the application of the ordinance to the national authorities.Third, the role that the Commission must play against the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission to guarantee a uniform application by international organizations, seems important to me.Fourth and I will thus finish certain speakers have already referred to it, the international legal order has changed.We noticed it during the aborted conference of Seattle and we see it in our bilateral conferences with various regions or countries of the world.The principle of competition must already be applied universally.And we must ensure that the standards in environmental and work are respected in order to avoid dumping in this sector, so that property rights are scrupulously respected, that state aid is reviewed, because as has been said in this assembly they distort the competition in many sectors and destroy employment within the Union and, finally, so that identical conditions are applied to prevent aidsOther countries do not extend internationally through traps, ultimately.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the Jonckheer report contains many good ideas on state aid to industry and several other sectors.First of all, it shows the resolution of the Parliament to impose a reduction in state aid in order to ensure the impeccable operation of the domestic market.Among the conclusions, several still arouse serious concerns within our group.For example, the fact that the amounts and the reduced level of public aid vary from one Member State to another prove the usefulness of this kind.Aid resulting from national selfish concerns give companies unjustified advantages, distort competition and lead to a European scale on an ineffective and non -profitable distribution of meager resources.It is no longer the same thing at all, here it is forms of atypical aid.It is necessary to promote the forms of state aid requiring efforts on the part of the beneficiaries.I am thinking in particular of the state guarantees about which the Commission recently took a position.They must obviously be considered as state aid, but in my opinion are a better solution than a direct aid.The competition report highlights the commission's confidence in strict legislation instead of insisting on economic arguments interfereing on competitiveness.	fr
"I believe that there are circumstances where the question of the principles and institutional rules is erased.I encourage the Council and its presidency to continue to defend the fundamental values ​​of the Union.I invite the commission to be less cautious.By this resolution, our parliament takes responsibility.That said, in my eyes, the resolution adopted today is a minimum minimorum, the least we could do.Personally, I defended an even firmer position, and supported amendments 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment proposed by the socialist group.I believe indeed imperative that the Council accepts only technical relations with representatives of the Austrian government where members of the FPö would appear.Associating Jörg Haider's party in a government coalition will trivialize the far right in Europe, and constitutes an extremely serious precedent which could generate important training effects in other members of the Union or in candidate countries.The Austrian Conservative Party takes a historical responsibility there.Our fundamental values ​​are in question here: as a democratically elected representatives by Europeans, we have no choice.We must, our voters demand it, refuse the unacceptable.Because when the spectrum of barbarism resurfaces, ""do not oppose, it is already capitulating"".I abstained during the vote on resolution.I condemn the racist and xenophobic line of Jörg Haider.However, I cannot approve the fact that an EU organ intervene politically in the internal policy of a Member State.That said, I cannot approve paragraph 4 of the common resolution and I cannot vote in favor of the resolution, even against the far right..(SV) It is obvious that European political leaders have the right and the duty to react against Haider and his party.European political leaders have the right to express their opinion on the political evolution of another Member State, as well as a Minister of State can express themselves on racist politicians in a local authority.Finnish experience shows, however, that integration is a better way to combat undemocratic forces than isolation.This is the reason why I voted against point 2 of the resolution.However, this assumes that all parties respect human rights.The ""common reaction"" of the EU presidency in the formation of the government in Austria is legally incorrect.The reaction of the 14 Member States lacks support in the Treaty.Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria who want to work for the defense of human rights.Despite my objection vis-à-vis the way of acting the council and my opinion that it would be better to work for integration rather than isolation, it was essential to clearly show the position of the European Parliament on questions of racism, which is why I voted for the resolution in the final vote.Thus ends the time of votes.Interruption of the session"	fr
Of course, one could also make progress if it succeeded in reaching the government conference on this question.It remains to be seen whether there is a consensus here.Then you will continue to see.We will take note of the suggestions on this topic.Mr President, I agree with the previous speakers and wish Portugal a successful council presidency.You said that this special topic is not on your agenda for the next government conference at the moment, but if this would be desired, you would consider it.Well, I and my 35 colleagues from the British Conservatives in the European Parliament would like to ask.It is clear to me that this is a provocative question.It should also provoke because it is a serious thing: some countries do not respect EU law as they should.We have to find a way to force such countries to comply with the regulations so that we regain the trust of our citizens.I can't imagine a better way to achieve this.Do you have a better suggestion?This is about whether the European dimension is more or less strengthened, especially through their involvement in the contracts.You will understand that this question must be examined at the government conference, and it is one of the topics in which only a special summit of the European Council can authorize the Portuguese chair to pursue it because it is one of the questions that are outside the institutional framework in which the next government conference is carried out.Now government conferences are something of an event, and they can also be something like a Christmas tree.Therefore, the possibility cannot be ruled out that these questions, which have repeatedly arise and have been served by one conference to the next, are brought up again.The problem is whether there is currently a consensus in the European Union to take up this question again, although one must take into account that if such a topic occurs, other, similarly received topics will extend the agenda of the conference.Mr. Dimitrakopoulos has the word for rules of procedure.I ask you to briefly grasp yourself.President!I see that I have to hurry.I really liked what Mr. Seixas da Costa said about Santa Claus.In Spain one speaks of the letter to the three kings.I just want to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent the letter to the three kings with its reports.Now it is at the presidency and the advice to bring gifts requested in our letter to the three kings.As I suspected, it was, strictly speaking, no question about the rules of procedure, but a conclusion of the pronunciation.We thank Mr. Seixas da Costa, but he too can write a letter to the three kings.I just want to say that this question of the Christmas customs that the Lord raised MPs plays an extremely important role.Only that Santa Claus has someone who determines him in this case, and that's why Santa Claus can only give gifts if they are approved by someone else.	de
The Commission cannot accept the first part of the amendment proposal 14. If the phrase not processed is deleted, then it will no longer be able to use a mixture of household waste in the co -operation facilities, which will also apply to waste that has undergone an extensive pre -treatment. The second part of this amendment proposal is in principle accepted. This leg can be made more clear if an explanation of the phrase not processed. The proposals of amendment 1, 2, and 7 of the European Parliament, aimed at adopting waste processing regulations, cannot be approved for reasons of principle. The Commission's proposal aims to establish marginal prices for pollutants and setting operational requirements for all types of waste or co -operation and this will not affect the law on the treatment of waste. The Commission may not approve the proposals of amendment 5 and 15, which seek interconnection with regulations on air quality and water. Such legislation already exists or is currently in preparation, such asThe instructions on the quality of the air and the coordination of measures to prevent and limit pollutants, as well as the proposed Water Framework Directive. The amendments would result in duplicate or less clear the regulations of these legislative acts. Amendment proposals 3, 16, 30 and 33-35 are not in accordance with the structure of the Directive and therefore cannot be accepted. There was some confusion over the proposal of amendment 13, where changes were made in many languages, but not in English. However, this amendment proposal cannot be accepted by the Commission. Articles 12 and 15 of the proposal relate to access to information and reporting. Are now stated in a way that guarantees the access of all stakeholders to the information they need. For this reason, the Commission does not consider that the proposals of amendment 20 and 21 are necessary. Amendment proposals 36-39 are intended to make the conditions concerning the measurements more stringent. They cannot be approved by the Commission because this would result in an additional burden on those responsible and because their true value cannot be justified. Finally, as you know, Annexes II, IV and V are the essence of the directive. These determine the marginal values ​​of pollutants derived from syncosis and incineration. As I have already mentioned, the Commission approves the proposed 500mg threshold for sulfur dioxide in the new cement-collar, which is justified in the point of view of cost-ranking analysis. Any further modification to make the marginal values ​​more strict or remove the right to exclude certain installations threatens the sensitive balance achieved in the common position. For this reason, the Commission cannot accept the proposals of amendment 23, 26, 28, 29, 31, 32, 40, 41 and 42. As for Mr Jackson's question about the incineration of carcasses on farms, I would like to clarify the following: Based on the exceptions specified in Article 2.2. The incineration of animal carcasses does not fall under the directive.	el
When implementing inter -governmental conferences and changes to the establishment agreement, we must take into account that the EU is developing every day, including contrary to the establishment agreement, as we have just seen. I welcome the Commission member Barnier and the Presidential State Portugal here today. HVK will be launched on February 14 and is expected to be completed by the end of 2000. This is a big task, but it is possible. I think that all groups here today, in general, agree that Helsinki's agenda is not enough to cover the reform needed to expand the Union. In other words, we need to go beyond the important issues that have not been solved in Amsterdam. These include expanding the majority voting - my country accepts it, but not its extension of the tax area - a new emphasis on votes in the Council in favor of major Member States and the number of commission members in an expanded Union. For the latter, Ireland wants to maintain his right to appoint a full and equal member of the Commission, despite the number of new Member States. We are ready to consider the new emphasis on the votes in the Council of Ministers if large Member States are willing to agree that each Member State has a full and equal member of the Commission. I think I'm talking about many small countries in this matter. At HVK, we also need to discuss the possible division of the establishment agreements into two parts - the area of ​​policies and the Constitution. We would accept the division of the establishment agreements, as long as it did not restrict the power of small Member States to re -negotiate a agreement on the policy of the establishment. In other words, we are unless we are fully represented in the Commission, we cannot participate in political discussions. So we keep an eye on the whole issue very carefully. We look forward to the fundamental rights book and want to see its content. Mr President, according to the Amsterdam agreement, has a maximum of 700 members in the European Parliament, and Parliament must discuss how that number is distributed in the expanded Union. Mr President, I also warmly support the approval of the report of Dimitrakapoulos and Leinen. It clearly highlights both the disappointment of the inadequate agenda and we want to keep the inter -governmental conference as soon as possible. Besides, this is favored by the schedule we decide. In my view, according to the current rules of the Treaties, the European Parliament does not have much to overcome the politics of confrontation. Instead, we need to focus on developing convincing proposals on the necessary reforms in cooperation with the Commission, as its proposals are valuable. Of course, we must, of course, also read the dialogue at all levels of politics. This creates an atmosphere of cooperation that promotes the quality of the reform. At the inter -governmental conference, representatives of the Parliament must make it clear to their negotiating partners that with the changes in the Union's institutions, we have the responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union. For this reason, representatives must be aware that such questions cannot be decided solely by political trading. The topics of this inter -governmental conference are very sensitive. It may be easy to develop solutions, but it is about how sustainable these solutions are in historical review. I will highlight two possible disputes. So far, the first is a guaranteed balance between big and small states. Europe is not a classic federal state and it cannot become one. The decisions to be selected must comply with the basic idea of ​​the European Union, which is the Association of States and Nations. Another level of confrontation is more difficult. As the number of members of the European Union will increase in the future, its institutions are required to have greater efficiency. This means a simpler and faster activity of the institutions. However, the European Union is and remains a complex structure consisting of many states. Of course, there are opportunities to speed up and simplify the operation of the Union, but the chances are not unlimited. If these limits are exceeded due to one -sided efficiency, then the base of legitimacy for the European Union will be shaken. However, I'm optimistic.	fi
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four essential principles of the internal market, freedom of service.There is no doubt that the new regulation relating to the provision of cross -border services will improve both the operation of the internal market and the competitiveness and the efficiency of companies.The strict conditions linked to the establishment of the service provision of lifting services - and I support our colleague Wieland on this point - are essential because they avoid crimes such as clandestine emigration and fictitious contracts.Why do I consider this directive so essential?For three reasons: the economic importance of the workforce from third countries within the EU, the competitiveness of companies and the proper functioning of the internal market.So I am delighted, on the one hand, to establish a strict framework and ask, on the other hand, that the controls carried out by the Member States be organized in the most efficient and simplest way.To conclude, I will ask the following question to the Commission, because I am regularly apostrophe on this subject: will the directive harm the membership negotiations?What interpretation do you make of article 1, since it plays an important role for our country located on the border of many new states and in membership negotiations?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, so far, businessmen should find that two of the important freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, were not applied for them.Indeed, they still had to submit to bureaucratic and endless immigration procedures imposed by the Member States in which a service was to be carried out.About thirteen million nationals from third countries stay on European territory.Although we do not know the exact number of businessmen among them, I start from the principle that their number is certainly not reduced.Until now, their access to the whole territory of the Union was therefore not governed by Community law.The two proposals for a directive directive aim to promote the free movement of services within the internal market through the introduction of the service provision of lifting services.In this regard, it seems important to me to emphasize that the issuance of this service provision will be flexible, namely within five days of a simple notification made to the Member State in which the service will be carried out, and that in addition, this document will benefit from a limited validity period and will not be automatically renewed in order to combat abuse.I also carefully became aware of the reserves advanced by the Commissioner.After examining the amendments introduced, I found that we could largely approve these reservations and we will behave accordingly during the vote of tomorrow.To conclude, allow me to thank Ms. Berger for the great meticulousness with which she examined the various amendments and, in doing so, the important meaning she has given to her report.	fr
If the purpose is now to draw up a list of listing or searching for legal investigations, we could also find them among the presenters, including the author of the report on this Convention. So I think the member of the Parliament, Schultz, could have not made certain comments. As I said, there have been numerous checks that guarantee the right of defense - in my mind that the judge's permission to interception of telecommunications is always necessary - or that the activities of joint investigative teams prohibit the accumulation of research and legal activities to the same persons. Parliament therefore wanted the Convention to apply solely to criminal matters;Restrictions on basic freedoms and rights intended in the Convention shall be limited to criminal matters. We need clear rules. In this case, the Council has certainly acted scattered, changed as the work progresses, it is absent. On the other hand, I would like to thank the Commission Member Vitorino for his presence here in Parliament during this discussion. As I said, we need clear rules in order to create a fair legal practice in Europe - without the enormous increase in telecommunications, without illegal use of video meetings - because Europe should no longer be repeated in the leadership of officials who, instead of managing law -use policies, and must be guaranteedunpleasant..(EN) Mr President, a proposal for the conclusion of the Convention on Mutual Legal Aid of Member States of the European Union will soon be accepted in the Council. Most people think it's time. According to the April 1997 action plan approved by the Council in April 1997, the Convention on Mutual Legal Aid should have been concluded by the end of 1997. Even more time will be spent before the Convention actually enters into force as it requires ratification of Member States. Although, according to the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty, the Convention enters into force when at least half of the Member States have ratified it, I would ask Member States to do all their butterfly in order to rapidly ratify the Convention. Unfortunately, previous experiences of the Ratification of European Union Conventions on Criminal Consortium have been disappointing. This Convention does not create a new or different system of mutual assistance. Instead, it aims to develop systems that have been used for a long time, tested and well-tested systems, such as the systems referred to in the Convention in 1959 by the Council of Europe and the Benelux agreement. The proposal drawn up by the Council contains provisions on different issues that several members of the Parliament have raised. A significant achievement of the Convention is that the requested Member State shall comply with the formalities and procedures required by the requested Member State whenever possible. This is particularly important when thinking about accessing the evidence obtained in court. In addition, competent authorities may submit requests directly without the need for central authorities to intervene. Generally speaking, there are two types of provisions in the Convention: those who oblige legal aid, such as telephone and video meetings, supervised breakthroughs and telecommunications listening;And those who do not have such an obligation and form only a legal framework for Member States who want to cooperate in a certain way, such as joint investigative groups, covert investigations and the sending and information of the courts. The Commission is very positive that the Convention contains provisions on new or modern research technology, as it is an effective way to combat the form of crime that has the best access to borders to open up organized crime. An obvious need to enhance criminal investigation can very easily lead to excess. However, the rights of defense should not be overlooked for all measures relating to criminal proceedings. I very much appreciate the fact that one di Pietron, which I congratulate him in his very short time, for the excellent work he has done in a very short period of time, at the key points of the report is the rights of defense.	fi
It is an instrument that does not always lead to optimal solutions.The basics of the economy tell us that the market is failing in many ways and anyone who denies such a fact is nothing other than an ideologist.Competition should bring the balance between supply and demand, ensure an optimal distribution of economic resources and facts.However, optimal efficiency does not necessarily flow from source.To avoid abuses, a general framework is essential, for example via the law in terms of agreements.But, for the most part, this only makes it possible to avoid abuses and is not enough, as such, to achieve socially legitimate objectives.Competition: Yes.The limitation of aid: where it is necessary and possible.But, given that the aid occupies most of the 1998 report on competition, I still want to say a few words about this, without prejudice to our colleague Jonckheer.The aid granted to small and medium -sized enterprises in the research and development sector and those aimed at training in regional and environmental policy are undoubtedly possible and must be achievable.As long as they do not lead to unacceptable distortions of competition, aid aimed at such objectives should be authorized.That decisions made in these specific areas can be executed is even more important than it is for the law in matters of agreements and mergers.We should not be content to nail the aids to the pillory: they must be considered in a differentiated manner, they must also be assessed according to what they contribute to achieving the aforementioned objectives.The latter remark was less addressed to the commission than to our colleagues from the PPE group.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, my dear colleagues, the report that I have the opportunity to offer you today is an opinion on the annual report of the Commission concerning the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the community is competent under articles 87, 88 and 89 of the treaties.The Commission's report is an essentially descriptive report which describes the evolution of state aid in the manufacturing sector as well as other sectors, according to different typologies, such as the mode of financing and the objectives pursued.I allow myself to refer to the presentation of the reasons for the quantitative part of the report and I will content myself with indicating here that the annual amount, on average, for the period under review, is around 95 billion euros, which represents a decrease in the order of 13 % compared to the period 1993-1995, decrease which, essentially, is due to a decrease in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.Clearly, the level of declared state aid is, roughly, stable on average during the period covered and is around 1.2 % of community GDP, it is a coincidence, more or less the equivalent of the community's budget for a year.	fr
What happens if more women actively and equally take part in the political decision?From the previous development it can be said that the agenda has changed - and if the agenda changes, the type of decisions will of course also change.If there is talk of odds, then the word competence is always mentioned.It is interesting, however, that the competence requirements are rarely defined.Instead, it often looks as if the men always have the highest, non -defined competence, just as before.It would be the most competent to be a man.I consider this view as evidence of the great incompetence among many decision -makers from the present.At the beginning of this year we made the demand in this plenary to declare March 8 for an international holiday.In anticipation of a positive decision of this question, I would now like to take the opportunity to wish all social democratic women every success with the Women 's World Marches, which will start in spring on international women's day.This global action wants to put violence against women and the poverty of women around the world into the focus of attention.Finally, I would like to underline what Commissioner Patten said at the end of the previous debate: The ideal policeman would be a black grandmother.We don't have that yet, but they exist!Mr. President, the position of women in politics is an important question that deserves more attention than this politically correct mutual that we are now experiencing.Undoubtedly, too few women are involved in politics.This is certainly not just due to the men's dominance in the party apparatus.In France, 95 % of MP local politicians are.Most of them do not belong to any party.In the leading bodies at department level, the non -partisan MPs, other rights or other leftists, represent the largest group. In order to be elected as local politicians, one only has to run.Access to national responsibilities often depends on the influences that open such mandates.Our faction is committed to equal representation of men and women in the organs of the European Union.That is why we are against quota policy and the positive discrimination, be it in favor of women or so -called social minorities.The minority policy, which makes superficial divisions under disregarding the deep unity of the human community, threatens the cohesion of the social structure and the balance of our democratic model.On the one hand, when we set up women's quotas, why not quotas after age or co -affiliation, odds for Catholics, workers, glasses wearers.The introduction of social quotas in favor of the lowest income categories would also not be more brain -tear than the creation of women's quotas.With such a philosophy, no elections or job advertisements in the administration were no longer needed.It would be sufficient to statistically calculate the composition of the ministries and parliaments.The quota policy would only increase the disenchantment with politics of voters by once again giving them the feeling that everything happens behind their back.On the other hand, such a policy is a sign of deep contempt towards women.	de
Investments and goals must be invested in the environment in the environmental sector.The future of future generations depends on it.Mr. President, Ms. Commissioner, I will undoubtedly repeat what my colleagues have already said, but I think the advice has to be told again and again what we think of life.So I will also emphasize - as the rapporteur has already done correctly - that Life is the only specific financial instrument for the development and implementation of the environmental policy of the European Union.This instrument is of fundamental importance, because there is an impetus for really new measures in favor of nature and the environment in Europe, which are then taken up and expanded by the Member States.It is also deliberately democratically designed because it is equally open to government and non-governmental organizations.For this reason, I am asking them to vote for the amendments that in no way correspond to the spirit of Life.In fact, Life can be used directly by the European citizen for measures through the associations.For several million - I underline: Millions - Members of NRO, the Union will be visible in Life to carry out an ambitious policy in favor of the natural environment.Life is also the basic instrument for the Natura 2000 network in Europe, for which the Member States in accordance with the community directive to preserve natural habitats as well as the wild animals and plants and the migratory bird directive are committed and which enables the protection of biologically valuable areas in our states.I would like to add that those who make this policy in their states are responsible for the fact that nature conservation policy is slowed down in Europe.This is unfortunate, because everyone in this hall knows that the financial instrument Life is not sufficient to realize all projects submitted by the Member States, many of which have to be rejected due to a lack of means.It should not be forgotten that Life is currently only equipped with 100 million euros per year, which does not even make up 1 per thousand of the Union budget.For comparison - for agriculture that has real effects on the environment, as we all know - 37 billion euros are spent.In view of this, my faction is of the opinion that the center equipment of Life must be increased, and supports the proposal of Ms. Lienemann to increase the budget to 850 million euros, because we know - you simply have to say - how high the expectations of our fellow citizens in the environmental area are and how half -hearted and unacceptable the compromise of the Council is, because the Life is moreLife programs have exceptionally high execution rates and have made an effective contribution to the development of new environmental practices.This undoubtedly also includes the first sustainable development projects.Mr. President, the environmental program of the European Union, equipped with considerable means (613 million euros), raises numerous questions regarding the proper use of public funds.A financial instrument of this extent must be transparent and efficient, which for the following reasons is not the case: poor criteria, dubious and unauthorized projects, no publication of balance sheets, the lack of evaluation measures.	de
The Mr President, all those who arrived here by car, train or airplane, could see how much damage to Europe at the end of last month has been caused by unprecedented severe storms, especially in France. What can members of the European Parliament do to remedy a major disaster? First of all, I would like to give my greetings to all my mayor colleagues, local representatives who have had to calm the population daily, organize relief activities and work in cooperation with public service sectors. They have deserved the trust of their neighbors. In addition, I would like to thank the rescue services and armies of the Member States of the Union, who, within exemplary inter -governmental cooperation, have come to support the efforts of their French colleagues. I would also be amazed at the mischievous situation that we have had to provide emergency assistance. If this disaster had occurred in Guatemala or Turkey, we could have immediately used budget budgets to help the victims, but nothing can be done in our own corn because the budget for a similar issue is missing. We also need to ask the Commission that it does not prevent local authorities and states from helping with disaster companies by interpreting the competition rules of the community too tightly. In particular, I refer to companies in the fishing and mussel cultivation, which have caused a lot of damage. As you said, a consignment member of the Commission, a mandatory suspension of operations must be replaced, and it must be possible to apply for a body support for fully renewed investments. In other respects, I believe that the mechanical application of perennial control programs is no longer in place in the damage that has been injured. On the other hand, I ask the Commission to give up it and help those who have a living from the sea to make the investments that they need to take urgency. Mr President, good colleagues, French storms between December 26 and 27 are said to have claimed 90 deaths and caused the 75 billion Francs, or EUR 11 billion. Almost three weeks after the devastation, several millions of people were still devoid of electricity and phone, 500,000 hectares of forest land and 100 million cubic meters of wood were destroyed and the historical heritage was also damaged, as the sad example of Versailles Castle Park shows. It is quite natural for such an accident to demonstrate national and European solidarity in favor of damage to the areas and the most in need of help. But as the previous speakers have said and, the Member of the Commission, as you said in your response to my colleague Jean-Claude Martinez with another accident, in November with floods in southwestern France, you have taken disasters in mind, but you may not be able to remind you thatThe speaker emphasizes the scandalous contradiction that helping victims of natural disasters is easier, much easier outside the Union than in the Union. Mr. Member of the Commission, for understandable reasons, to propose us an uncertain opportunity to support the remote future on the basis of a new objective of the Structural Funds 2 or on the basis of a transitional period for objectives 2 or 5B. You used these words to my colleague on January 11, 2000 in a written answer. I have a copy of it for you. We understand very well that you cannot say anything else when you have an irresponsible attitude that is not only characteristic of the Commission, but that has also been characterized by Parliament that you cannot do anything without a legal and financial framework. But I do not ask me and I do not say this to the attack against you, do not provide a support for the victims of the storm as a result of the appropriations that have previously been given in the regional policy that have nothing to do with this. Therefore, the budget point for natural disasters must be urgently returned to the amending budget. Grants decided at the Berlin Summit must be introduced and the forest policy pursued in most Member States in most Union Member States must be changed, but this is another problem.	fi
"However, I wonder: If Turkey is offering a brigade, do we also have to give it the right to have a say in this policy?According to some ""Haider"" in the government, in Turkey.That seems questionable to me.Second, the Baltic states are also ideal.Are they also included in our defense policy?That is at least a very interesting position.Mr. Hoher representative, you have strongly reminded of the progress that we have achieved in this area from Amsterdam to the Helsinki summit, and also to the resolutions that have already been made according to Helsinki, for example to create the three committees or to plan a 50,000 to 60,000 men strongly, which were recently taken during the informal meeting in Sintra.However, this rapid procedure makes the gap between these decisions and the ongoing government conference even clearer.In my opinion, in this context we have to find a sustainable compromise between those who rightly urge this policy area to accelerate this policy area, and that, in the opinion of which such progress must continue to be achieved at the intergovernmental level.I would like to say the latter: be careful because this policy needs great democratic legitimation!We know about the weight of public opinion when it comes to the areas of external and security policy.Therefore, I ask you, of course, only in keywords whether, according to your opinion, some of the following questions can be treated within the framework of the reform: redistribution of the double structure between the Commission and the high representative;A clear and unaffected differentiation between civil and military crisis management.For example, this could mean, for example, that the Commission is involved in the Committee on Politics and Safety Questions that the responsibility of the community for non-military crisis management is strengthened, the Minister of Defense is created and the EU contract, NATO contract and WEU will be coordinated;Further questions would be the legal capacity of the European Union, the increased cooperation in this area, parliamentary control and finally the financial resources.Do you think that some of these questions can at least be included in the agenda of the current government conference?Mr. Solana, I sit close enough to be able to look them in the eye.I think you aged, your face is full of wrinkles.I'm sorry to see her like this and I could despair when I hear her talking about the sandpit games, as Ms. Maes said while at the same time keeping other things.They appear here and do not say a word about the blood that is shed in Kosovo at the same moment.They are responsible for huge responsibility, because under the pretext of ethnic cleansing now flows in other ethnic cleansing in Kosovo.You are Spaniards, you come from a large country, Mr. Solana.Spain was not the same as Franco, it kept its unity and kept the Basque Country and Andalusia and Catalonia - and that was quite the case.Nobody equated Spain with Franco, and nobody has jeopardized Spain's unity, putting a fascist dictator.But today they identify Yugoslavia with Milosevic, they are jeopardizing the Wojwodina, they jeopardize Montenegro, they jeopardize Southern Serbia - they are responsible for the resulting situation."	de
24 and not against. Secondly, I would like to point out that there is an arrangement here, a common practice, that on Thursday votes last until 13.30 and that, for what is left, votes are made in the afternoon at 18:00, following the emergency votes. We have been following this practice for years and it is not possible to change according to our fun. It should probably be given to all colleagues. Colleagues should simply work here until Friday, so that at noon we can deal with our visitors at noon. Mr President, maybe I can help. The rapporteur said she agrees with your proposal - that is, the president's proposal. And I recapitate: The President said we would vote at 17.30 on the postponement of the vote for the next plenary session. Please follow his proposal. Sarah Ludford said she agrees. So I ask that the Ludford report for the next plenary session be postponed at 17.30. There is absolutely no problem with that. Agrees with the regulation. It can be done immediately before voting. It is the usual process. That's why I can't make the decision now. According to the Regulation, the postponement decision is taken before the vote on this issue. The votes ended. VOTE JESULTS - GRAEFE ZU BARINGDORF (A5-0044/2000) (GUE/NGL) report, in writing.(PT) The issue of animal health, and in particular of bovine and pigs, is something that is worth dealing with very carefully. That is why it is important to carry out health controls on animals of these species in the context of intra -Community transactions. Such an approach is also needed in view of the need to make further efforts to permanently eliminate diseases such as whipping, tuberculosis and brucellosis, as well as to implement appropriate health procedures. But we should not miss the need to provide proper aid to producers, with particular care for small farms and family productive units, as, as in the case of Portugal, very often the already low income of small farmers are not severely affected by the deceased. It is therefore necessary to have an intervention in the future that allows for both consumer and producers' interests to be properly guaranteed, and above all small farmers. Ferrer report (A5-0066/2000) we cannot vote in favor of the report, as human rights in Mexico are grossly violated. This was demonstrated in the report of Amnesty International in December 1999, which highlights the serious problems in the Chiapas Region. We consider it positive that the trade agreement has incorporated the demand for the promotion of democracy in Mexico - as well as respect for human rights - but as long as this requirement is not followed by a specific action, the words of the air remains. And in the old trade agreement with Mexico there was a clause for democracy, but it was never implemented. For this reason, pressure should be exerted in Mexico through international organizations, such as the UN, and through individual states, and only after there are substantial improvements in the human rights sector do we believe that we can conclude a new trade agreement with Mexico.	el
I see the commissioner smile, but I speak with the authorization of all the political parties in Northern Ireland, whose views may differ in many issues, but they are identical to this. The European Union must admit that, when making such drastic decisions in relation to conflicting scientific elements submitted by the fishermen themselves, which were immediately rejected in their entirety and concerning the preservation of their own fishing stocks, serious problems will arise. On a recent visit to Brussels, duly accredited representatives of those fishermen who traveled from Northern Ireland were threatened with miscarriage from the meeting when they tried to develop their arguments on a matter for which they had prepared very well. This is scandalous, their case had to be heard. It must be recorded, and I would like to record today in the minutes, that I was attending a meeting where our scientists reported that soon Claus Clerphin was to disappear from the Ireland Sea, while at that time the reproduction of this fish in the area was not a special increase. As I said, all the parties of Northern Ireland have a common stance on this issue and those responsible for this regulation on the quota of the Gadu must review that decision that will not only mean the disappearance of this fish, but also the destruction of the fishermen of Northern Irish. Mr President, the reports of our colleague, Mrs Attwooll, are of great importance, as is the fact that we can have the largest possible number of data in the Member States' fishing areas, especially when we have the obligation of the Commission to draw up the Commission, in accordance. That these information and sending obligations are simply optional and refer to data and areas very different from each other may undermine the final objective of the committee's proposal. It was therefore obvious - as already noted here - in the context of the multi -year orientation programs that there was a significant damage to the states that strictly and sent the corresponding data to the Commission, against those who did not adhere to them or simply did not send them. It is necessary to point out, above all, that not all Member States have the same number of data. Some have different areas, and given the volume of elements to send, they could be damaged against those with a smaller volume, if the same deadlines are set. Consequently, it is necessary in our opinion to modify these deadlines for submission. Many of these elements are also confidential in nature, as it was also pointed out here, as they influence the competitiveness of the stakeholders and their businesses. It is therefore necessary to act very wisely in this field and to ensure the confidential nature of these elements. Some of them are unacceptable from a legal point of view, as well as noted, e.g.those mentioned in business taxation. In any case, and since I do not want to expand much, Mr President, aware of the time limitations, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Mrs Attwooll, on the important work he has done within our committee.	el
I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements. I agree with the Commissioner's statement that it is time for the fine words to be done. We all know how low women are represented at all levels of decision -making, because we have the statistics and they speak for themselves. I agree that the exact statistics are just as important, because only when we see the figures change will we know that we are starting to overcome the problems. This will also be revealed by systematic monitoring. Providing equal opportunities is a long -term commitment and process. At the same time, it is necessary to take positive actions on our part and this means the recourse to participation rates and other measures. We can learn from the successes mentioned, not only by looking at the actual number of women who have been elected, but also considering the influence it has on the nature of governance, in order to make it clear that everyone is benefiting from a real representative system. I am pleased to tell you that in Wales, which I represent, 40% of our members of our National Assembly are women thanks to the positive actions of the political parties, but on the other hand, we only have 4 female MPs from Wales in the House of Commons, which make up only 10% of the total. Consequently, statements by authorities, support in principle are not enough, because they have not been rendered. If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision -making, we must commit, taking the actions necessary for its implementation. Mr President, the position of women in politics is an important issue that would be worth something better than the politically correct bidder we observe. Undoubtedly, women involved in politics are extremely few. It is not certain that the only reason for this is the dominance of men in party mechanisms. In France, 95 % of elected representatives are city councilors. Of these, the vast majority is not affiliated with any party. In the Prefectures, the first party of France is that of the irrepressible representatives, some from the left or others from the right. To elect a local government spokesman, it is enough to want it. However, access to national responsibilities often depends on the seat of these posts. Our team wishes to encourage equal representation of men and women in the organs of the European Union. For this reason we reject the policy policy and the positive distinction which, after all, is expressed in favor of women or supposed social minorities. The policy of minorities, overwhelming the deep unity of the human family, in order to establish superficial divisions, dangerously threatens the cohesion of the social trunk and the balance of our democratic model. On the one hand, if we introduce female quotas, why not create age or ethnicity quotas, quotas of Catholics, workers, binoculars. The creation of social quotas in favor of the most moderate categories would be as ridiculous as the introduction of quotas for women. With such a philosophy we would no longer need to organize neither elections nor administrative competitions.	el
The report is not only a masterpiece of hypocrisy, but also an indication of some degree of illusion, for good colleagues, if the negotiations begin tomorrow, the agreement could be signed in a year and would come into effect in three years. I warn you from the thinking that the Balkans' countries in Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia would not be supposed to submit to you properly and appropriate membership applications in three years. A few days ago, Racan announced that Croatia would submit its formal membership application by the end of 2000. I am sure we will receive other membership applications and that this great work and intelligently designed membership architecture will be lost because it has been behind, as we have been behind for 20 years and what has happened in the former Yugoslavia. This would not be serious if the European region in question did not have these modern problems if there were no problems that have been addressed, but which the new Macedonia government has not yet resolved and concerning the coexistence of the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, as well as problems related to Kosovo, or current economic problems,Statical mafia. This would not be serious if there was no problem with Greece's traction right that would be prohibited as such, for almost decades it has prevented Macedonia from using its own name, so I hope that the interpreters did not use that letter of letter when I talked about macedonia. This is absolutely nonsense. In my opinion, using the abbreviation is, first of all, an insult to our Greek colleagues and Greek citizens. This problem requires a quick solution. Finally, I would say that, through a happy coincidence, I got a letter recorded on March 8, which Macedonian President Georgievski had sent to the Commission's member to Fischler and referring to the former Article 4 of the European Union, ie the current Article 49, wished to join the European Union. Why hasn't the Council informed us about this? Why hasn't the Commission informed us at the official Macedonia request? Mr President, a Member of the Commission, Balkan is not just a dark cave, in a political sense. Even though we think about the remarkably positive development of the Macedonia Republic in recent critical years. The terrible ethnic cleansing of its neighboring country did not move to the soil of Macedonia. Paradoxical, but true, the war on the Kosovo Polje battlefield produced the opposite effect: a dangerous gap between the Macedonia majority and the albanic minority narrowed considerably. From the point of view of the former group, the latter group behaved loyally towards the common state during the international expansion of the Kosovo conflict. From the point of view of the Albanian minority, the Macedonian and the Macedonian state fully fulfilled their duties required by the neighborhood towards the extremely tested Albanian majority. Therefore, this significant result of Kosovo's warfare can be rightly appointed to the second state of the Macedonian Republic. Swoboda's balanced and commendable report is concretely linked to this surprising and delightful result. In short, the European Union knows what it should do in Macedonia. It should help this new regional, asylum of many war refugees, to fulfill its role as a promoter of the desired stabilization agreement in the Balkan. Mr President, I have been worried about Macedonia for eight years, and I would like to disagree with the member Dupuis. We are not hypocrites. Things have evolved well, and I think the Macedonians are happy about it. Don't be so disgusting that you ruin their joy. I think we should approach this more positively. There was no war in Macedonia. However, it has suffered from the war and sanctions in the surrounding areas and continues to suffer from sanctions that were rightly launched by neighboring states. It suffered extremely from the Kosovo war refugee stream. Therefore, it must also be said that the development of Macedonia has been amazingly consistently democratically.	fi
"For this reason, I and many of my colleagues support the majority of Blokland's checks because we want to introduce the highest standards. It is not a problem for me if they prove to be technically difficult to implement - it is not a problem, as the UK has a shameful record of low recycling of household waste in Europe and has plenty of room for improvement. Many of us believe that our country's government will always encourage the construction of waste incineration plants instead of encouraging to adopt alternatives. This would mean that the waste would be ""thrown into the oven"" so that they would be out of sight and out of mind, which I think is the wrong approach. We need to focus on reducing waste, recycling the remaining amount, and relying on incineration plants as a last resort. Mr President, I, too, would like to thank Parliament's member Blokland for his report, which aims to improve the Commission's proposal, as well as other reviewers. However, waste incineration must be regarded as the last resort and, as already stated, - waste reduction, reuse and recycling should be our main goal. I only wonder about the need to reduce, recycle and reuse waste from Parliament Bowe's need. Does his position remain unchanged when he discusses the Packaging Directive? It is interesting to see if he then holds on to his principles. Waste incineration only causes it to encourage it to increase waste, as Evans said. In order for incineration plants to be economically viable, the amount of waste must be sufficient to maintain them. We also need to remember that the waste does not disappear. They turn into dioxins and toxic ashes - what do we do for it? In Ireland, a few operators have suggested that it be used in building materials. What would be its long -term consequences? Despite what my colleague Hyland said, we have a shocking record in Ireland in the waste management sector. We belong to the countries where there are most landfills in Europe. Now it seems that the government is moving on to the use of landfills for use by waste incineration and is presented as a green alternative. The government says, ""We will transform waste into energy - isn't it great?"" When it actually tries to cheat on citizens to believe that it makes sense for the environment. A recent decision of the Irish court that a waste incineration plant should not be located in the agricultural area was very important. It is very important that we prepare for this well that we first look at waste management first and primarily. If the government proposes the introduction of a waste incineration plant instead of a landfill, it is completely wrong. We need to look at the basic reasons why waste is generated at all. Mr President, the revision of the Committee on Environmental Health, Public Health and Consumer Policy generally emphasizes the high level of environmental protection and therefore many of these reviews are acceptable. However, there is a different infrastructure of waste treatment and waste incineration in different countries, and as a result, the same regulations are not actually the same for everyone. In Finland and in some other countries, sorting waste close to their place of origin has been taken far. So we do not burn mixed waste as in some countries. Mixed burn is a bad environmental policy. Sorted waste can be effectively burned as so -called co -incineration with other fuels. The revision of the Committee on Environmental Affairs combines unjustifiably combining mixed combustion and parallel burning. It may impair indirect economic effects through the level of waste protection in countries sorting the level of environmental protection. Therefore, checks 14, 17, 18 and 27 should not be accepted. Finally, I point out that the cement industry lobby should not be placed in a better competitive position compared to the actual hazardous waste plants. Mr President, I find myself agreeing with Grossetête and Paulsen and - which is quite alarming for both of us - including Bowe. However, I would like to note in particular one of the actual concerns presented by the UK agricultural representatives in recent days."	fi
They have first -hand knowledge of social needs, have a better sense of problems, and they also know how to design projects and implement them effectively without burdening them with unnecessary bureaucracy, thus getting the best results. Finally, I would say that two of the four of our reviews have been approved and two abandoned. Therefore, we have been forced to refrain from the final vote because we do not understand why environmental aspects cannot be taken into account when deciding on projects to be financed and we do not understand why each Member State could demonstrate the funds of the URBAN projects that it has not used in accordance with community programs. Mr President, I would like to recall that we have discussed a lot about Urban initiative in the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee. There are many thoughts there. I would also like to remind you that it was the smallest community initiative, and that is why we proposed to add its budget in the check that was rejected. We apologize for this because the money under the Structural Funds had indeed been used in some Member States, and this money could have really helped pilot projects because I recover that projects under Urban initiative are specifically pilot projects that allow you to develop real urban politics. I would also like to draw the attention of the Commission's attention to the consistency between different policies, and I would also like the Commission to carry out projects according to the URBAN initiative and the projects that are known as a sustainable urban policy to be coherent. Mr President, I would also like to recall that the European Union does not even have European city policy even today, and I want to clarify that maybe this could be further discussed within the Union's reorganization and the inter -governmental conference, so that the European Union will finally have a real urban policy. Mr President, I would like to recall that I voted for this report on sustainable urban development called Urban. It is very positive, like all other community initiatives. Europe shows that it is present when something is done on behalf of all European citizens, not just for the development of an individual Member State, no matter any state. Urban's goal is to find solutions to urban degeneration, and this is of great interest to the elderly and is therefore very interested in the pensioners' party. There is no worse situation than the situation of an elderly person living in the city. I hope that this community initiative could be an example of how the problems of elderly people living in cities can be solved..(DA) Five members of the European Parliament Liberal Group are in favor of Leader+, Equal, Interreg, but not Urban. The next time these programs are reviewed, the EU contribution must be concentrated in cross -border tasks and shall take into account the EU expansion..(DA) We have supported a report on the Commission's Communications to Member States in the economic and social revitalization of cities in crisis and suburbs on strengthening the guidelines for sustainable urban development (Urban). In principle, we oppose such programs and structural funds, but since the vote is merely how - nor to what extent - these resources are to be used, our statement is only based on the content of the proposal and we are generally believed that the proposal to revive the urban areas in the crisis contains reasonable attention and good project proposals..(FR) This report proposes over -the -art of what the report calls the strategy to revive centers of cities and suburbs that have suffered from the crisis of the capitalist economy and its consequences: the increase in unemployment, exclusion and crime. This report emphasizes that, in order to ensure sustainable urban development, the purpose is to develop an urban policy that does not reject the main victims of the economic crisis: unemployed, immigrants, women, women and marginalized. However, this report does not say anything about the causes of this crisis and its causes.	fi
"Our general policy consists, however, in recognizing the inherent dignity and the exceptional contribution of native peoples to the development and plurality of society, which we consider particularly important in the context of the Nordic dimension that we are trying to develop and which we discuss with North America.The commission shares the growing concern due to the disappearance of the Russian journalist, Mr. Babitsky, and under the conditions of the independent media of Chechnya in general.This subject is at the top of our main concerns in the face of the critical situation of the civilian population of Chechnya, which Mr. Posselt has just spoken.Alarming news talks about human rights violations.It is obvious that there has been a disproportionate appeal to force in this conflict.The commission delegation in Moscow participated in a troika approach in the European Union on 11 of this month.She underlined her strong concerns about press freedom and freedom of expression and insisted that the Russians clarify the circumstances of Mr. Babitstky's detention, taking into account their obligations in the field of human rights.We expect Russians an appropriate response.In the meantime, the conclusions to which the ""General Affairs"" council arrived at the start of the week confirmed the message I gave today.We are willing to repent on the subject during the ministerial Troika UE-Russia which will take place in Lisbon on March 2, if necessary.Finally, with regard to Cambodia and Khmer Rouge, we fully agree that we must continue the highest leaders of the Khmer Rouge for the crimes for which they are responsible.I totally agree with the arguments that Mr. Morillon has advanced.We energetically supported the procedure of the Troika company with the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Hor Namhong, on February 4 of this year.The European Union stressed that it completely supported the UN efforts as to the need for the court to continue the former heads of the Khmer Rouge.In addition, we also salute the continuous dialogue between the two parties.The optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary General of the United Nations, on the chances of achieving an agreement concerning the proposed court, is encouraging.The Commission will continue to remind the Cambodian authorities the problems with regard to the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights, through the CE-Cambodge cooperation agreement which entered into force on November 1.Debate human rights twice in a few days will have been useful.I hope that we will still have the opportunity, but I hope that we will have less examples of their violation during the years to come.Thank you very much, Mr. Patten.The debate is closed.The vote will take place at 6 p.m.Environmental disaster in the waters of the Danube The agenda calls for the common discussion on the following resolution proposals: B5-0164/2000 of Mr. Leinen, on behalf of the group of the PSE group, B5-0167/2000 of MEATEN and Thors deputies, on behalf of the Eldr, B5-0168/2000 of the OOSTLANDER and GRANDETEVER deputies, on behalf of PPE-DE,"	fr
However, I need to be informed, so I told you that I can't answer you today. Not knowing the answer, I sent a letter to the Minister of Economy and Finance on December 14th. I haven't received an answer yet and I am looking forward to. I will pass it on to you as soon as I receive it. I am sorry that Mr Commissioner is once again trapped in an inventive, and in this case passionate, speech. In Spain - I want to remind you all - it's not that we are in the pre -election period, it's that in twenty -five days the elections are. It is comforting for the Chief Commissioner that these elections will be held in twenty -five days, which means that such questions may not be asked again. In fact, I find it important to say that Andalusia is going to receive a 50% increase in the Community context and that Spain also holds a record in absorbing the amounts from structural funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the regulations of implementation and that it is decentralized through the regional development planning. Finally, would I like to ask a specific question to the main commissioner: Does it consider a change in the regulations of the implementation of structural funds or does the existing distribution criteria considers acceptable? I find the discussion emotionally charged. I clearly understand that there is a dimension that is not exclusively Community. This should be used to the idea that there are permanently elections in all countries of the Union. What makes me happy is that the resources of the structural funds are essentially discussed in Greece and Spain. We were talking about citizen discussions here recently, public discussions. The more we talk about Europe and what Europe does about everyday life, even if we disagree, the better, it is enough to speak objectively. I will not express my personal opinion, Mr Member, about a possible change in the regulation of the structural funds. It was just approved last year in Berlin, and I will apply it for the next seven years. We will discuss this on the occasion of the consistency report, which I consider an important appointment here, with you and before you, to report and at the same time to chart prospects. At the beginning of next year, the time will come to refer to any adjustments or modifications. Currently allow me, please, to implement the regulation that has not yet been implemented if it is dated from the Berlin Summit. That's what I can say today. Thank you very much, Mr. Barnier, for your answers. Questions No.48 to 50 will be answered in writing. Question No.51 (H-0049/00): Subject: New Facilities of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today, the internal market harmonization is still working on the old, temporary, facilities, despite the fact that its new building was inaugurated in June 1999. Due to this somewhat paradoxical situation:her? The Parliament's honorable MP addressed a question in November 1999 on this issue, and I would like to refer him to the response given to him at the time.	el
"First of all, I would like to thank my group's environmental colleagues who approached this problem with the group on traffic matters. This disaster applies to both traffic and the environment and is not limited to one area. Once again, we are discussing in Parliament about one accident. I could list the accidents in this area for the 10 years I have been in Parliament, but I only have three minutes. It is now high time that both Member States and the toothless tiger called the International Maritime Organization, and - lastly, not least - oil companies and tanker owners are taking their own responsibility and trying to prevent these ecological and human pests repeated year after year. How many different things do we still have to take before the powerful people are introduced by the actual control of the harbor states throughout the European Union and not just in certain areas? How much pollution do we still have to take before introducing tankers with separate tanks and dual soles in the industry? How many sea birds still have to die before the shipowners stop cleaning their tanks at sea, what, as stated in our resolution, pollute much more than any united accident? Although I admit that, for example, there has been some progressive progress in the area under the control of the port states and minimum requirements for crew, the situation is still the situation of our late colleague Ken Stewart's words to quote that ""shameful vessels sail into and out of the European Union:Member States must act quickly and with determination. Our governments need to give the necessary appropriations to make the control effective, and they must also stop the jerking when it comes to marine safety. Erika did not demand lives, but it may have destroyed the livelihood of many people. Just like Sea Empress, just like Braer. It is certain that all three ships left behind environmental damage. Our group is compassionate about the residents of Britagne, whose area this accident has ruined, just as my group felt compassion for the residents of Western Wales and Shetland Islands the previous time. Isn't it a high time to stop taking part and start sharing enforcement announcements to get rid of these shameful ships and it would be safe at sea? Otherwise, this year we will have to discuss a new resolution presentation, as another tanker who sails under the comfort flag will unfortunately sink and drain the crude oil into the sea. The time for resolutions is over. We need action now. Unfortunately, I am afraid that the Council will not be able to act again and that we will have to discuss another marine and environmental disaster in the future. Mr President, every time such an accident happens, it is said that it must not be repeated anymore. In fact, we can never prevent such accidents at sea, but we all have to learn whenever such accidents happen and apply the teachings we receive so that we can reduce the risks in the future. Erika's accident was serious especially for the residents of Britagne, who suffered the most, but it was also devastating to animals in much of Europe. Some say it was the worst accident ever for the birds of that part of Europe. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds thinks that up to 400,000 birds, mainly south, may have died. Many of us have probably seen scrambling and shocking pictures of how the veterinary authorities stopped oil -stained birds. We all want the highest standards for the vessels, regardless of which flag they are sailing. We need to monitor the rules and ensure compliance with the ""polluting pays"" principle so that both ship users and oil companies are pressured to enable the best practices using fines and some incentives."	fi
"And it is a woman who was elected.The other event concerns France where a law was voted to have that women and men were represented equally, following the declaration made in April 1999 at the ""women and men in power"" congress.The ministers concerned were committed to taking concrete measures and policies that would change power data.We must congratulate the Prime Minister, Mr. Jospin, to have ratified this commitment in the most clear and most formal way.Many have been the statements made and the policies carried out in the Member States.Certainly, the figures tell the truth.And the figures for Europe are still problematic.Women represent 24 % of governments, and 22 % on average for deputies of national parliament, or a rate varying from 6 % in certain member states to 40 % in others.The number of women in commissions exercising power, developing policies, is very reduced.Even in countries like Germany or Belgium, which have precise legal obligations concerning the number of representatives of both sexes, the participation rate of women in the various commissions does not exceed 18 %.It is therefore advisable to promote concrete policies.There is a mixed policy that will include long -term political commitments, as is now in Sweden and Finland where we have a respective rate of 56 and 44 % of women in government today.Organization and statistical follow -up.Appropriate control and structures are needed according to culture, mentalities and specific problems in each region.And, of course, these policies require a budget, financial support.The increase in the number of women, or, as the French Prime Minister said, Mr. Jospin, the increase in the influence of women on decision -making centers, is the best way to renovate political life, to modify the approach of problems, to enrich the political thought of new ideas and experiences - those that women transmit through their different way of life and development.The recent initiative of the Finnish presidency aimed at establishing indicators identifying and reflecting the participation of women in decision -making centers is of great importance.These are indicators encompassing national parliaments, regional councils, municipal councils, and which give a complete table of women's participation in each Member State.I consider that it is a major political question to create and support statistical data, that it is a tool or a political means to set objectives, compare performance and assist our efforts.Such an initiative aimed at systematic monitoring is also inserted in the project that I will submit for the fifth program for women.It should be added that, if the legislative measures and institutional interventions of the Member States have effects on the decision -making centers of political power, we do not observe the same effects in the private sector.Contacts that I had with very large European companies and multinationals on our continent, a dramatic assessment is released.There are companies that employ thousands of thousands of workers at European level at European level, or even often, and in which the participation of women in management and management is less than 2 %!"	fr
I fear strongly that we were once again in an authority that evolves like an anonymous satellite across Europe: I would appreciate a authority like the devil the holy water.I hope we can't get there.I also salute the white paper.But do you think that the food security agency will have enough biting to prevent an event from the BUF war that we knew and to prevent France refuses to lift the ban on?Have you said that the Commission could refrain from granting subsidies to countries that act like France?Would you also propose that the Commission can give provisional payments, for example, similar to those that British breeders are currently asking for?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, you said during the plenary session last week that the future European food agency for food security would not settle in the outskirts, but you did not say what you heard by periphery.For example, the action of the EU unit established in Dublin has shown that a physical distance is no longer an obstacle to the efficiency and the establishment of contacts.The primordial missions of the future food agency have been the subject of data, multiple announcements, all coordination work.We have published recommendations for the development of this food security and - as you have noticed - we have gathered scientific knowledge and we popularized them.With current techniques, all of this can be done anywhere in the European Union.So I ask you where you plan to install this agency.Regarding the composition of authority: first, it will use on -site scientists who will collaborate and lead consultations with expert scientists in the particular fields studied at a given time.In addition, this food security authority will have a council.You will notice that we have not specified the composition of this advice in the white paper.This is a question that I expect to be discussed between Parliament and the Commission in the coming weeks and in the coming months.I plan that the Council will be made up of key players or representatives of key actors.Its function must be established in detail in the proposal I will present to the Commission in September.We haven't done it yet but it will be done in September.I do not expect council to exercise any function consisting in directing scientists in the way of doing their work.This would affect the independence of scientific advice.But it would have a global competence, which would consist, for example, to ask this authority to investigate in particular fields requiring research.Mr. Florenz asks if the parliament will have his say in this area.This is a question that requires examination and discussion.There may be a number of points of view on this subject.Some could estimate that it would not be wise for Parliament or the deputies of the Parliament - or, in fact, the people appointed by the Parliament - to be part of the Council.	fr
I do not forget, we cannot forget that 80 % of European citizens currently live in cities and that is why this Urban funding tool is very important. Once again, I emphasize that we ensure that urban dimension is taken into account in all programs of the Structural Funds. Mr President, next, I would like to talk about Interreg, and as I made Parliament Member for Arlene McCarthy, I would now like to thank the rapporteur Francis Decourrière for his quality and proper work. He has emphasized several passages that we - and many of you - agree: they include the importance of cooperation between this European cooperation and its three areas, cross -border and inter -regional cooperation;The added value brought to the Interreg community, its clarity compared to the programs of the Structural Funds in general, as well as the actual strengthening of programs and actions between countries cross -border and states;The importance of common structures, which I called another conversation that begins today, that is to say, the inter -governmental conference, as a European spirit, which we need to reinforce, that is, how we can strengthen this community through the joint structures and solid funding of the program;The importance of the partnership in ensuring the active participation of all relevant local and regional authorities, as well as private sector organizations and the parties to the labor market. After these general considerations, I would like to focus on the most important observations you have given. The first of them are related to the schedule and content of the initiative. You say that these guidelines have been accepted too late, and especially the rapporteur emphasized that previous programs are in danger of interrupting. It is true, I admit it, and good members of the European Parliament, you know, that's why. Approval of Interreg's guidelines has been delayed to March or April of 2000. I admit it, like you, I note it. However, I have noticed that Member States and regions are already actively designing programs for Interreg III, and the proposal for guidelines was also distributed three months ago. I have also noticed that the cost of accepting costs will be decided as soon as the program is presented and I confirm that the aid can be paid retroactively until January 1, if the program is presented before 30 April. This was my first attention. My second consideration is this: as far as the preliminary list of actions entitled to subdivision B, I can say and confirm that I have requested the Commission to accept and add new specialty areas to the list of actions entitled to sub-area B, particularly related to the development of small and medium-sized enterprises or cultural heritage. Therefore, this list would no longer be considered exhaustive. Third attention: Importance of part of the inter-regional cooperation area C. The Commission agrees with the observations that Parliament has submitted on the importance of part of the inter-regional cooperation area C. As the rapporteur hopes, I will provide you with detailed information about the implementation system of the actions included in this area. Fourth attention: Monitoring Center and possible technical support office. As your request, I have decided to remove all references from the text to the technical support office and its consultation and expect the Commission to complete the debate on the outsourcing system. Good Members of the Parliament, however, if we remove all references and if we later give up the technical aid from the office's assistance, it will surely lead to some posts to be increased in order to be done, because it has to be done, and I cannot increase the work volume of the current staff, even if our mission is to be better controlled by ISPAI answer, often with Member States.	fi
The investment for the equipment needed for continuous sampling controls can therefore be depreciated within a few years. During the first reading, the committee's proposal improved, and even with wide consensus. This has created significant expectations to the citizens. I would like to appeal to colleagues to meet these expectations. A consistent line of the European Parliament will greatly help to gain the confidence of the citizens, and even those who stay close to waste incineration facilities. Mr President, Mrs Commissioner, this directive does not satisfy us at all, as it implies the collapse of two texts, one of which concerns the incineration of dangerous waste and the other the incineration of non -dangerous waste. This creates a problem at many stages of incineration: in receipt of waste, processing and transporting them. So one can wonder what the benefit of this collapse was. The answer is found in the report by Mr Blockland, which strongly opposes the co -operation industry. Nevertheless, here is the paradox, the rapporteur is also in favor of mixing dangerous and non -dangerous waste. Therefore, where is progress for the environment? Our team's desire is not to favor one type or the other, because both are extremely useful for waste management in Europe. We need to take into account the practices of each Member State by maintaining existing industrial balance and see how we can better protect the environment. This is exactly suggested in the common position. Priority should be given to the limits of the emissions of the most harmful substances: NOx, dioxins, furans. After all, the common position proposes for 2007 a marginal value of NOx for the incineration of dangerous waste, which is currently not existing. In terms of dioxins and furans, marginal values ​​become mandatory for all waste. To date, marginal values ​​have existed only for non -dangerous waste. It is therefore sad that the Blockland report does not propose realistic solutions, when we know that a large number of waste management instructions are not yet implemented or implemented by Member States. Wishing to go further, we become counterproductive. The desire to revise the marginal prices of this directive every three years is absolutely impossible if we consider the large investments that industry should make. Industry needs legal security and reasonable time. In fact, the problem we face is that in Europe we do not have a clear definition of waste. Therefore, there is a constant confusion when we need to review a text on waste or when we have to make new proposals. Therefore, there is an urgent need, a lady commissioner, a complete revision of waste management in Europe. Mr President, I would like to start congratulating Mr. Blokland on his report. We know that the cremation of waste is a very difficult and very technical sector, but I believe that with this particular report we have done a project that is worth recognizing. Unlike Mrs Grossetkte, I believe that the common position and exposure of Mr. Blokland will be a much more important, substantial contribution to the protection of the environment in terms of waste incineration, whether we refer to dangerous or non -dangerous waste.	el
"For the sectors of aquaculture and oyster breeding, which are defenselessly exposed to the unstoppable pollution on the coasts, the consequences are very serious, not only because of the immediate pollution of the first few days, but also due to the later loss of market shares and the rejection of a product with all guarantees, which is affected by the pollution itself, by consumers.It is about outskirts with an unstable economic balance, which was severely damaged by this oil spill, which unfortunately does not represent an individual case.The main resources of these regions - like those of other neighboring areas - are the ones who have nature ready.A nature that is too often caused by human activity, which could be prevented with greater caution and greater control on the part of state power.""Prevention is better than healing,"" says a saying and also says the household.Ladies and gentlemen, preventing is very inexpensive compared to the costs of disasters like this.Mr. Fischler says he is always there when the parliament calls him.In the case of the Erika, however, he gave the appearance - maybe not with us, but yet with the inhabitants of Brittany and Vendée - as a commissioner for fisheries or only to be temporarily on hand.As this parliament showed in its first resolution of January 20 of this year, the needs of fishing, oyster breeding and tourism, which are particularly affected, must be taken into account.That is why we asked the Commission to adopt measures for the fishing sector through the mobilization of special funds.Galicia and Brittany, both the end of the world in Europe, have also been siblings through this oil spill.We also cannot understand that experiences such as those with the Urquiola or the Amoco Cádiz have not led to strengthen legislation in the field of maritime traffic in terms of security in dangerous goods and with regard to the low-cost flags.We demand that this time is the last one.We demand that we pull all teachings and quickly change our laws and fill the gaps that always confront us with the incredible and make the incredible reality.The cause principle seems to be appropriate and beyond that.It is now time that the polluters will start paying, because so far those affected and taxpayers have paid.And the polluters should not only pay, but also to clean the affected areas.Therefore, I am pleased about Mr. Fischler's answer, especially that he recognizes the need for retrospective measures and the rapid reaction to the request received.In the name of my faction, the socialist fraction, I would like to address a solidarity message to those affected, to the fishermen, the breeders and the entrepreneurs who make it possible for the sea to put its products on time on time, to the mayors and the politically controllers as well as the volunteers who were involved in cleaning.They should all be insured by our solidarity.I would like to ask the Commissioner two questions.The parliament has assumed a resolution in which it is required to apply the pollutant principle in this case and to make both the ship owner and the owner of the freight liable for the damage."	de
"Mr. President, I agree that from the point of view of efficiency and analysis of the services offered in relation to costs, progress remains to be made.But why always under the brand of ""privatization"" and ""liberalization"", I absolutely do not understand it myself, and I am a business leader.If it is that we do not care to ensure for all conditions of access identical to postal services but that we are only concerned with the conditions for the development of capital for companies in large agglomerations.However, deputies must be the representatives of all citizens, and this means that they are in the obligation to reflect not in terms of business economy but in terms of political economy.Very concretely for postal services, this means, first, that the question of employment must be a priority.I have nothing against liberalization and privatization, but the premises must grant themselves.Second, we must have the guarantee that there will be no decrease in postal services for the citizen.Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this threat is very real.Mr. Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country where after liberalization, prices have radically exceeded those of all the other member states of the European Union.It is precisely also a possible effect.We must ensure that it does not happen.Third, it remains essential in the first place to ensure a universal postal service at a reasonable price for each citizen, in any place.Secondly, a single price should be observed for all Member States.And thirdly, it is necessary to guarantee a distribution of mail and a lifting each working day.Regarding the question of the price/service ratio for respective postal shipping categories, it is possible to consider other price reductions.This is what La Poste also declares itself.It should not remain more than 300 g, the analysis shows that a minimum limit of 150 g must be guaranteed so that it can still count.I think that today's debate has been beneficial and important insofar as Mr. Bolkestein knows the position of this Parliament and can also take into account the problems from the start.Mr. President, the 1997 directive, published on January 21, 1998, which initiated a partial liberalization of postal services in Europe, provided for a later revision, in a form of elsewhere complicated, since it was to be the subject of a commission proposal before the end of 1998, then be decided before January 1, 2000, to finally enter into force before January 1, 2003.zero.The first two steps were not respected, which, logically, should compromise the third.First question: anyway, were the expected deadlines not too short?Obviously, yes.We really do not see how the Commission could have evaluated, before the end of 1998, as provided for in article 7 of the directive, the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year."	fr
This position reminded that the fishing agreement that ended in November 1999 was in force for the Moroccan fishing zone, which is defined as the waters on which Morocco has sovereignty or jurisdiction. This definition in no way affects the regime of the Western Sahara and its coastal waters. This is an issue that is subject to international law, and in particular to various UN resolutions, as well as the responsibility of the UN Secretary -General, whose efforts to find correct, fair and sustainable solution is steadily supported by the European Union. I would like to begin expressing my gratitude to Mr. Commissioner for his kind answer, but noting that I find it inadequate in every respect. In the letter in which I was referring to the text of my question, the European Commission's perception of the coastal waters of Western Sahara was little clear. Nevertheless, you mentioned it with excessive clarity. Of course, the Kingdom of Morocco is at the moment a force that holds the western Sahara, a territory where a process of self -determination is underway. In any case, under international law we should consider that the Kingdom of Morocco exerts control over this territory, but in no way has sovereignty over it. Since it has no sovereignty over the territory, it does not even have it on its coastal waters. It would mean that we are prejudice to the future of the area, as there is a possibility of a referendum on self -determination to decide the independence of this territory. In what position would the Western Sahara government be then in terms of territorial waters that would - in this case - really - dominate? I totally agree to reach a fishing agreement with Morocco that favors the interests of the European Union fishing sector, starting with the Spanish fishing sector. But I believe that this is otherwise contrary to a legal interpretation of international law, which I ask to do with all types. Does the Commission are committed to carrying out this official consultation with the UN Secretary -General? Yes or no, Mr. Commissioner? I have regretted many things in my life and one of them is that I did not become a lawyer. So - let the honorable gentleman allow me a biblical image - I acupid to these waters with some nervousness! But I realize that international law is absolutely clear and that the issue of territorial waters is directly linked to the issue of the domination of the region itself. This issue is currently being considered in the context of the referendum and the initiative of the Secretary -General of the United Nations. As the Honorable Lord knows, we strongly support this initiative and, if there is a way to help the United Nations Secretary General, then we would definitely like to do so. This, of course, also applies to his special representative.. Since they refer to the same issue, questions 40 and 113 will be examined jointly on the basis of the Commission's request. Question No.40 of K. (H-0241/00): Subject: Minds against persons in a recent statement at the United Nations General Assembly, the Council Presidency stressed that the EU is the key body that contributes to the promotion of mines of the hosts on the world.	el
"Undoubtedly, the events in Kosovo and overall moved our hearts and thinking in the Balkans;There were important things in the Middle East, where the Parliament President played an important role on her last trip;Some important things have happened to clear the way for the summit between Europe and Africa, in which I was able to participate together with the Portuguese presidency;There was the big conference in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America, to establish closer relationships between the European Union and the countries of Latin America.Undoubtedly, we were also close to the heart of Chechnya, and I will have the opportunity to say a few words at the end of my explanations after I had an important conversation with the representative of the European Council, Mr. Álvaro Gil-Robles, about his recent visit to the region.But I assume that you asked me here to tell you directly about foreign policy and, above all, security policy in Europe in Helsinki.I will go into that briefly;If you would like to address inquiries to me in the question time, I will be happy to answer you.Allow me to remind me that the summit in Helsinki did not take place under the Finnish presidency a century ago, but only two months ago.In Helsinki, fundamental decisions were made on our continent for foreign and security policy.It was mainly three types of decisions, and I would like to respond to them.The first was the decision on the formation of triple committees in the European Union to make decisions in the field of crisis management: first, a committee for political and security issues;Second, a military committee as representation of the head of the general staff of the fifteen states of the Union;And thirdly, there were decisions about the relationships that the European Union had to entertain with third countries and other organizations.Above all, I refer to the relationships between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and the relationships between the European Union and those countries that geographically belong to Europe, but not or at least at the moment not belong to the European Union.I will essentially limit myself to these three points to keep them up to date with the events.For the first and as far as the decision -making bodies are concerned, this morning, on March 1, 2000, the committee for political and security issues (APS), which had been used on the last council ""general affairs"", met for the first time.So two months after the explanation and the decision made in Helsinki, we have a conference of the committee for political and security issues for the first time in the European Union.I had the opportunity this morning to meet him and be at lunch with the representatives.I can tell you that you can be satisfied.The fifteen states have named knowledgeable diplomats at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important topics that we have to face in the coming months.Second, the military committee, which represents the various chiefs of general staff of the fifteen states, will hold its first session a little more than two months after the explanations of Helsinki.As you can imagine, this military committee has several obligations.In a preliminary, an interim stage, his main task will be to advise the advice and myself and to make the first decisions on how the final organs are to be used, which we absolutely want to make at the end of 2000 or early next year."	de
Whatever the system adopted, the cost will eventually come to the consumer. The best way to implement our environmental goals is to use manufacturers for both money collection and to withdraw and recycle cars. Manufacturers cheated Mr Florenz and Mr Lange to submit amendments here that seriously weaken these proposals. Don't be cheated on car manufacturers! If you want to take full advantage of this Directive, use your vote to reject these amendments. Mr President, Mrs Commissioner, Dear colleagues, this discussion, contrary to what we could think of, is not a technical character. It has become extremely political. Yesterday we honored our institution with a political debate. Today we will be degraded if 314 Members fall under pressure from the lobby of some car manufacturers. Asking consumers to pay half of the cost of withdrawing vehicles, as set out in amendment 38, while the common position calls for the entire cost of withdrawal the producer, parliament is in danger of presenting a picture of a non -defendant of the interests of consumers and consumer interests. We cannot accept this. It would be a previous one that would leave the door open to any kind of pressure in many other areas. It would also be the first time that the European Parliament would weaken a position of the Council, and as a rule I think we are mainly criticizing the position of the Council. The system e.g. Free withdrawal of old vehicles and the increase in recycling rate will lead to a similar increase in recycling activities and jobs created in this way. Therefore, for the good of the consumer, the environment and the new jobs that will be created in the field of recycling, we must in no way modify the common position of the Council, which, as it is, is absolutely acceptable. Mr President, I believe, like so many others here today, that this measure is right. This is a useful measure and it is something we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. Some details need to be resolved, but most technical issues have been resolved. We reached the final question. During the first reading, only the Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy raised this question, and only I as an author of the Commission as an opinion of an opinion on the part of this Commission, raised this question to Parliament. It's just about the question who pays. The Council's joint position has achieved a reasonable compromise, according to which manufacturers have to pay a significant part of the cost, not all, as Mr Bowis mistakenly said. In fact it may be as small, our lawyers say as 20% or 1/5 of the cost. This is not unreasonable. If you take the consumer in the United Kingdom, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange said, or any other car brand in the United Kingdom and who has been paying excessive prices for these cars for years, higher than all similar prices in other parts of Europe, why should he pay? Has already paid.	el
Although I have signed this question as a selected representative, in fact, I have to say that I am not behind it. As a member of the Commission may guess, the questions are asked by farmers in the Union, who, in the current situation, ask whether they have to pay an invoice due to expansion through their income and through community subsidies. A member of the Commission has not spoken unequivocally. However, your unit, the Commission, a few colleagues in the European Parliament, we all know that there are studies and estimates. A member of the Commission is sometimes a master to give round answers and circulate the answer and not respond. However, if the Commission wants to support its positions in the field, it must fade the ambiguities and be unambiguous. That is why I ask a member of the Commission, even if he does not want to talk about his information and research that he at least try to calm farmers who really have worries and whether farmers would have to pay the invoice of the expansion by compromising their income and whether a member of the Commission could not be impacted by the Community. Mr President, Mr Member of the Parliament, I also believe that you are aware that the income of farmers is not just about subsidies, but must be purchased mainly in the market. Therefore, the comparison you use in this context is not suitable. Second, they are two completely different questions. In your question I have answered, you inquired what the expansion costs. The other question is whether a common agricultural policy will be changed in connection with the expansion. I can only tell you now that a common agricultural policy is in force in the form that it was decided in Berlin for seven the next year. In addition, Berlin also decided on financial views, that is, how much money we can spend. You talked about potential studies: The first studies have existed for many years, and we have delivered them to Parliament. We are currently conducting new studies. As soon as we have the same results, we are happy to be prepared to give them your use. Question No 50 (H-0190/00): Subject: The EU Fisheries Agreement The Fisheries Council of Northern and Southern Fisheries, the Fisheries Council, met in October 1997, analyzes the balance of fisheries agreements in northern and southern, as at the same time as the shipowners in the southern contracts have to rely on the extent. The Fisheries Council also investigated the underlying use of the northern contracts, which will occur, despite the fact that other Member States are interested in using these fishing opportunities. Therefore, the Council asked the Commission to investigate decisions to allow the transfer of quotas from one Member State to another. Similarly, it asked to investigate how the financial cost of the agreements should be divided between the community and the shipowners equally and discriminatoryly. Can the Commission tell you what studies have been conducted on possible transfer of quotas and what have the results been? What decisions have been made to balance the financial cost of contracts in northern and southern? What is the Commission's assessment of this imbalance in contracts in northern and southern? I have prepared a question because I have previously inquired about some decisions made by the 1997 Council of Ministers, which concerned some measures that were intended to take on fishing agreements and which I understand have not been implemented in the European Union for the time being. I would not like to be a prime member of the Commission, because I would just like to ask if the next time the fishing agreement is reformed with Greenland is intended to be renewed with the agreed efforts, they will not know that it does not use or leave much fishing quotas without using fishing equipment that is currently not able to use fishermen.used only in part. After all, I referred to it at the beginning of my answer. It is indeed a problem, and a member of Fraga Estévez, the Commission, in principle, agrees with you that unused quotas should be able to transfer. However, we are now still lacking the formalities that are possible, as the Member States have not given proper approval.	fi
It is true that economic aid, in this regard, is a certainly essential element of the possibilities of action which will be given to those present in the field.I take up here the statement that Doris Pack has just made us, and I insist that we have, in the European Parliament, to hold our responsibilities in this regard, but obviously by asking not to be the only ones.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to warmly thank the rapporteur, our colleague Brok, for his report.If the council had worked as quickly as Mr. Brok did, we would actually be much more advanced.You really have to deplore the negligence of the council in this area.In his report, the rapporteur is very important to the principle that we have a duty to provide rapid help but also, rightly, from the principle that this aid cannot be offered without limits and without discernment.In this regard, I would particularly like to emphasize the amendment 5 proposal which very clearly establishes that the credits of exceptional financial aid can only cover the budgetary needs of public, semi-public and municipal Kosovar administrations and institutions which are controlled directly or indirectly by the Minuk.It must be clear, Mr. Commissioner, that we support the mini, that we support the institutions put in place by the United Nations - in particular, of course, the fourth pillar - and it is unacceptable that we support the parallel structures which formed and continue to exist in Kosovo.What to do with this money?I would particularly like to emphasize human rights.In Kosovo, the West fought for human rights.What's going on today in Kosovo?We have been able to put an end to the great expulsion action carried out by the Serbs but, almost every day, unacceptable incidents take place;People are killed, people are prevented from living there and as they want.Each day, there are attacks on Serbs, Roma, Bosnians but also, as before, against Albanians.If this information is correct, I was really frightened to learn that an Albanian doctor, who worked - certainly at the cost of great difficulties - in the hospital located in the Serbian part of Mitroviça, finally gave up operating there for his fellow citizens because his life was regularly threatened.These are incidents and situations that we cannot tolerate.I heard - I don't know if it is correct or not - whether the Serbs even continue to exploit a mine in Kosovo, in the Serbian part.Rumors claim that Serbian militias are still active.It doesn't matter if threats or crimes are committed against a Serbian, a Roma, a Bosnian or an Albanian.I don't care who works on the dismemberment and the partition of Kosovo.What matters to me is that the organs we finance reach the objective we want to achieve, that of a multi-ethnic Kosovo, of a coexistence in Kosovo.	fr
"However, I would not want to start this reflection before our present initiative on everything based on the products, after talking with our commercial partners, at a rather advanced and reliable stage so that we can move on to the next. Finally, I clarify that market access is not everything for countries that sometimes have sufficient exports for domestic reasons, whether it is the possibilities of distribution or material infrastructure or transit potential. That is why we must also consider the issue in terms of what we call capacity building, that is, technical assistance measures that we should apply so that this access is not only theoretical but also meaningful. This is my answer to this issue with regard to the future. Thanks to Commissioner Lamy for his answer, to the point he reached. Of course, I agree with what he said in the last part of his answer on the need to develop the potential of the least developed countries as well as the need to take asymmetric measures, which will result in a certain level of protection for the purchases of these countries without we seeking any consideration. However, my main reflection when I asked this question - and I feel that this issue was not fully examined - is about the question of what ""all the products basis"" mean. Commissioner Lamy speaks of some agricultural products, but it was precisely the protectionism of common agricultural policy that hit the growing countries more and delayed the development of many of these countries in agricultural production. What particular comments can he make about what products and areas will be about measures and for how long? We want to hear such a message. I wonder if a better way to move on - both to gain the confidence of developing countries and to set an example for other commercial partners - it would be to say as Europe ""now is the time; we will offer these things now. We do not want to wait five years;The answer to this question will have two legs. First of all, I think I have clearly answered your question by clarifying you that the difference between the ""whole"" and ""all basically"" was a certain number of agricultural products, indeed limited. I am particularly referring to sugar, which for many of these countries may be an additional resource. You know that the community, in this case, the Commission, thought of the detailed review of the sugar regime. These are issues where we will undoubtedly come back. This is about us exclusively. Concerning the general initiative we took, I would like to try to convince you that at this stage it is more important for these less developed countries that the Community can persuade the United States, Japan and some developed countries to follow our initiative, because we are in terms of real export."	el
Once again I would like to express my thanks for the quality of the work done, not only the rapporteur, but the entire committee.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Closing the annual session period I declare the annual session 1999-2000 closed.(The session is closed at 10:41 p.m.) Opening of the annual session I explain the session period 2000-2001 of the European Parliament to open.The agenda Mr. President, as the second item on the agenda for this morning we have the recommendation for the second reading of the cocoa and chocolate products for which I am the rapporteur.Yesterday at 8:30 p.m. I found out by chance that the coordination should take place today at noon.It seems to me, however, it was planned for tomorrow at noon.I am therefore completely unprepared and did not even have the opportunity to prepare the list of voting and check whether or not.As you know, this topic is quite controversial and also plays a major role in the media.I have been a member of this parliament for 10 years and have always been informed as a rapporteur when the order of voting has been changed.I would therefore ask that this vote will be postponed to tomorrow.This would solve my problem without, I believe, to affect someone, because it is a relatively short coordination.President!We have nothing against this shift in the vote.I just want to insist on the fact that the other votes that are intended, especially over the summit of Lisbon, will also take place tomorrow.Under this condition we have nothing against the shift.According to the communication of the responsible departments, the list of the upcoming votes tomorrow is quite long.President!Like Mr. Lannoye, I was also surprised by the news last night that the vote on my report in second reading was also planned for 12 noon.The political groups urgently asked me to request them emphatically not to have the vote takes place at 12 noon, but tomorrow, since the political groups had no opportunity to apply for separate and namely votes.It was a big surprise that the vote was planned for 12 noon.In the name of many others, I would also like to ask to set the vote for tomorrow.Mr. Blokland, the officials of the responsible departments, let me know that your report is already provided for tomorrow's coordination.I now ask the plenum whether it agrees to postpone the vote on the Lannoye report.If so, this is considered agreed.Annual legislative program (continued) According to the agenda, the continuation of the pronunciation is followed by the annual legislative program of the European Commission for 2000. Mr. President, Mr. Commission President, my dear ladies and gentlemen!If the citizens of Europe are looking for this Europe, they are particularly looking for it in Brussels and especially the Commission.I am not happy as a parliamentarian, but at least I have to take note of it at the moment and until further notice.But that also means that an extremely challenge is on the commission.If you want to bring about the big turn that you, Mr. Commission President, have spoken, then you have to start damn quickly.	de
I am also happy to be able to confirm that I will take part in the next meeting of the parity assembly, which will take place in Nigeria in March.The Commission would like to assign a more important role to the parity assembly, especially with regard to the promotion of a more intensive political dialogue with our development partners.The Commission agrees to the rapporteur that combating poverty is still the most important goal of developmental policy and will always have a key role.In order to develop, however, the countries must be actively involved in the global economic system.As far as trading in our development partners is concerned, the Commission would like to guarantee that the special economic and social restrictions of the AKP countries will be taken into account with every new measure.Ms. Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmine system should be continued.I don't agree.This system has not proven to be effective, since it is actually only used very few of the 71 countries.I think it's too slow.It is therefore understandable that the developing countries welcome the new system because it will be more flexible.With regard to the future accession of countries for the Agreement of Lomé - z.B. from East Timor - I can only repeat what I recently said in the European Parliament Committee for Development and Cooperation, namely that the door is open.The applicants decide whether they want to knock.Then we take a stand.As for Cuba's application to join Lomé, the Commission notes that the AKP countries support Cuba's application according to their latest declaration.The EU has always been of the opinion that a constructive attitude is appropriate to Cuba, as is expressed in the common point of view of the EU.However, one has to admit that the negotiations will be difficult.As far as the ivory coast is concerned, I can say that the total amount of EUR 28 million has been repaid, as has been agreed after checking the irregularities.As for the financing of the European development fund through the budget, I can say that this is currently being checked.The Commission is for this, but we cannot provide any further information at the time and procedure at the present time.I can say about Article 366a that during the negotiations on a new partnership agreement, a new procedure for the treatment of violations of human rights, the democratic principles and the rule of law was introduced.What it looks like at the moment, the parliament will be informed about all decisions on the basis of Article 300 on the basis of Article 300, and the Commission will continue to observe the decisions of the parliament in this matter.It is not intended to apply the approval process in parliament in connection with such decisions.This would be necessary to change the recently decided contract of Amsterdam.Finally, a note on the South Africa agreement, which was also mentioned by the rapporteur.I am happy - I would almost like to say that I am happy - to be able to tell you this evening at the end of this discussion that the South African President today promised the solution to open problems, as South Africa was proposed by the EU Foreign Ministers last Monday.	de
It is advisable to set correct environmental specifications, but this does not ensure their respect. Respect and compliance are concepts that require effective controls and proper monitoring. Think about e.g. What would happen if we set wonderful specifications on hazardous substances, such as dioxins, but we left at the same time that would allow for various obligations to monitor emissions. This would mean that we are finally not making any progress and the quality of the air we breathe does not improve. In addition, we need to ensure that they do not occur with some years of dangerous consequences for public health because we did not impose emissions of some dangerous substances. Who else will then be responsible if cancers or leukemia occur because we did not impose the measurement of the hazardous substances from waste of waste? The Florenz colleague also emphasized, among other things, that clear rules for measurements are needed. I expect that we will make every effort to ensure the right methods of tracking. As for the scope of the directive, I find it satisfied that we have come to a good wording thanks to our effective cooperation. Of course, we should find that in this wording we removed quite a bit from the first reading, as we had considered it as the only exception that we could accept raw wood. Regarding the definition of incineration installation, unfortunately we were not able to agree in advance at this point. After many discussions with various colleagues and the European Commission, a simple solution was found with amendment 43, a solution that I believe can be accepted. If waste is used as raw material substitutes, e.g. When recycling glass, inter alia, the procedure is not covered by the Directive. However, if only one part of the waste is used as a substitute for raw material, the procedure falls within the scope of the directive. Concerning the recovery of waste from waste, I would like to remind you that the European Parliament approved a resolution on November last November on the integration of the environment into total energy policy. This resolution calls for particular attention to the application and development of optimum energy recovery methods. The Environment Committee therefore constitutes the recovery of energy and in the cremation of waste. The Environment Committee requested that ammonia measurements are made. Due to error, however, the specifications for ammonia cannot be applied to all facilities. That is why I suggested for the sake of consistency a specification for ammonia to the cement -backed and common waste incineration facilities. In terms of constant sampling tests for the measurement of dioxin, I believe it is absolutely possible to perform. Following the crisis with dioxins in Belgium, this country applied a good technique of measuring them. For a month, samples are accumulated in which measurements are made and the result of these measurements gives a precise picture of dioxin emissions during the previous month. Obviously this method of measurement is better than making measurements twice a year. According to experts, this method is no more expensive, as the measurement in the accumulated sample is much more economical.	el
This must contain minimum requirements with regard to the age and properties of the ships for access to the waters and ports of the community, also a general environmental liability principle that enables a clear determination of the liability of the individual actors, in particular the agony, and the hard punishment of violations.The Commission must pay attention to the coordination of information activity, must not shy away from disputes about the negligence of certain large ports or shipowners and must focus on the question of low -cost flags at the center of the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus.I would like to remind you that the Erika was registered in La Valetta.However, the states must not pass their own responsibility to the Union, because the accuracy and effectiveness (and thus the means) of the port control depends on the safety of everyone.We have to and will be particularly vigilant in the coming months to ensure that the victims, who undoubtedly do not affect the slightest complicity of this catastrophe, are completely compensated by the cause and thus really the teachings with regard to marine safety are really pulled out of the oil spill, so that the polluters are finally put off by the lives of our people in the coastal regions.The most effective prevention is given if every potential cause threatens the hardest financial punishments.Report Katiforis (A5-0017/2000) We agree that fishing is one of the economic areas with the greatest interest in protecting the marine environment.However, one must invoice that many causes contribute to the damage to the marine environment: pollution and contamination by oil tankers and other maritime traffic, industry, the pressure of man's activity on the coastal strips and of course the uncontrolled fishing.However, it should be emphasized that the small coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing can be reconciled with a sustainable and not destructive development for the world.We consider it possible to reconcile a policy of management of fishing stocks based on the conservation of the sea environment with the interests of the fishing sector.However, it must be taken into account, however, that there is an interdependency between the income from the fishing activity and the increase in fishing effort.As a result, measures must be taken within the framework of common fishing policy and corresponding financial resources must be provided that are suitable for securing the income of those who live exclusively from fishing, especially in times of standstill or reducing fishing.This results in the importance of the proposals we have made with this goal.In the Commission's communication, a number of goals and suggestions are listed in which the need to continue the efforts in the area of ​​control and surveillance, to enact new technical measures with regard to the selectivity of the catching procedures, to check the application of the legal provisions, among other things.In its communication, however, the Commission reveals at the same time that it does not see itself able to enforce compliance with these legal provisions.There is no lack of existing measures and suitable means, because the Commission has a whole range of binding regulations, measures and decisions (international and community origin) for the areas of fishing and protection of the marine environment.	de
Unlike Ms. Kaufmann, I am not for strengthening control over the European Central Bank because I am for the independence of this bank.But on the political level, control must be established appropriately.It is also a question of setting up the Triangle Commission, Council and Parliament in the field of foreign and security policy, a domain where everything is far too concentrated on the only side of the Council, and to particularly look at the primitive measures to manage crisis for which the skills are incumbent on the commission alone.All this has not been sufficiently included in this general concept.We must examine whether changes are necessary for this purpose as part of the intergovernmental conference.The Portuguese Presidency of the Council said that it would start reflections on this subject in order to consider an extension of the mandate.I would still like to point out another important point.The debates that we are carrying out these days, for example, on the government of a European country, still show that we must establish that the European Union has an intellectual and moral orientation and aims at the rule of law, the community and the common good and that restrictive fundamental rights must therefore also be incorporated into the treaty because this will constitute an important stabilizer.I pray to those who still show large reservations in this area to wonder if the time has not come to perceive this link and to show the necessary courage in order to reach the advances which are imposed in the field of fundamental rights.The European Union does not need - or little of them - new instruments, it does not need new skills.What she needs are the instruments allowing her to use her skills.This is why we must ensure that the instruments work in such a way that we can pay, in the name of the citizen, the tasks which are now formally entrusted to us by the Treaty.I think it is on this point that the efforts of this intergovernmental conference should be particularly concentrated.If we manage to progress in this area, we will also be able to consider the historic mission of the widening of the European Union.This is what the decisive emphasis must be put.I am convinced that, under your direction, dear presidency of the council, this element will evolve positively.Mr. Chairman of the Council, you understood by listening to various interventions that the idea of ​​trusting the Portuguese presidency, not to increase the task by putting the start of the intergovernmental conference later prevailed, not without contrast, within the Commission for Constitutional Affairs and at the level of the presidents of the political groups of this Parliament.I can assure you that it was not easy to do it last week, in the commission that I chair but, ultimately, we decided to bet on the Portuguese presidency and we would like to win this bet.	fr
"Dialogue on Europe: challenges of institutional reform The agenda calls for the communication of the Commission - ""Dialogue on Europe: challenges of institutional reform"".Mr. President, Ladies, Messrs deputies, the commission is currently being debated and he is very necessary to make his work over today.So I come essentially to talk to you, as indicated to you on the agenda of your assembly, of a new initiative that the Commission offers to provide its answer, which is not the only answer, to a great challenge which must mobilize all the actors of European construction, at the forefront of which are naturally the parliamentarians that you are, but also the commissioner that I am, but also the ministers who sit on the council and the national parliamentarians andcivil servants who work in our various institutions and who are committed and motivated by this European construction.This morning, in the long debate to which I attended alongside the Prodi President, many of you mentioned the democratic deficit, the distance from the European institutions.By saying this, I am not only trying to ask the question - one of you said it with great clarity and strength: Who does what?And it is the least of things that citizens understand that what does our different institutions do.The question is immediately also to know what we do together and what we want to do together in the future, especially with the countries that will join us.Thus, this democratic deficit also challenges us and that is the reason why, the very day after the opening of the intergovernmental conference, during which I will have the honor of representing the commission alongside Mr. Prodi, and by working, I repeat, in close confidence with your two representatives, Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatsos, we decided, earlier, to launch ""Europe and on Europe "", to take our share in this direct contact with citizens.All the commissioners have committed themselves, each time they have to go to a country, and not only to their country of origin, in a region - for my part, it happens to me three or four times a month - to devote a moment of their schedule to a direct dialogue with citizens, not only with the elites or institutional managers that one usually meets, to also establish direct contact, in a high school, in a high school,Go into contact with people, answer questions and listen.This will therefore be the part that we will take, as you will take it yourself, to this necessary effort, to this ardent obligation, which consists in reducing the democratic deficit, that is to say the remoteness of citizens in relation to what we do.This initiative, we want to lead it in cooperation with the Member States, in conjunction with the European Parliament.We will make a regular synthesis, so that the state of opinion is well measured and that one can adjust or redirect.We also wish to lead it in consultation with national parliaments, local elected officials, non-governmental organizations, socio-professional environments and the media.Relays of opinion, political groups and parties, European, national parliamentarians, elected officials, I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of Regions, the Economic and Social Committee and Civil Society organizations, the university environments will be concerned."	fr
I can tell you, the value of the colleague that the Presidium has in principle decided to publish a register in which the MPs have to state their financial interests on the Internet and the quäds are to examine the associated legal questions.However, a decision can be expected shortly.(The parliament approves the protocol.) Reform of the Commission on the agenda follows the Commission's communication on the reform of the European Commission.I give the word to the President of the Commission Romano Prodi.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!In July last year I solemnly took on the commission's reform here before you.I would like to briefly remember what happened in July at the time: the crisis of the previous commission had led to its resignation, I had just been appointed commission president, and they had agreed to this appointment.The highlight of this was the commission that I have taken over by the commission: a thorough reform that must lead to a real revolution in the working method of the Commission.This obligation was finally redeemed today: the reform is presented to you here, in a well -structured white book that has just been assumed by the Commission.I would like to emphasize that the Commission has decided unanimously in this case, with one voice.What are the focus of this reform?First: Determination of the political priorities and, by a targeted use of the resources, their implementation of their concrete actions.This is the key point of the system, because with the help of the priorities and the targeted use of the resources, politics will enforce its leading role and fully assume its responsibility.For this purpose, we have developed a new mechanism completely new in political program planning: a system that enables the Commission to determine annual political guidelines, then on the basis of which the household procedure and to determine concrete goals for the general directorates and - which is of crucial importance - to keep the relationship between available resources and assigned tasks under control.Under this perspective, measures -related management is the key instrument to ensure that goals, activities and resources are coordinated.The second point concerns human resources.They are the support of our actions: the staff is our actual capital, the capital of the Commission.This staff has extremely high qualities, such as you can rarely - or not at all - be found in the individual administrations of the Member States because of our attitude procedures and criteria.I saw this impression that I had won when I started the commission presidency during my daily work.Nevertheless, I found at the same time that there is a very bad mood among the administrative staff: While you used to be proud and happy to belong to one of the institution admired from all sides, you are now demoralized due to the months of criticism.All of this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform.Settings policy, career development, mobility, disciplinary procedures, all of this is regulated according to completely new criteria: stronger consideration of individual merits, credible and, above all, verifiable assessment systems, constant further training and more responsibility for managers.We will be active in these areas.The third point, which is also quite delicate and played an essential role in the crisis behind us, is financial management.	de
"Mr. President, to intervene lastly gives me the privilege, Mr. Commissioner, to tell you that this assembly is mainly favorable to your initiative and has shown that it had total confidence completely justified, in my opinion in the way you govern this boat.But, since we are in the same boat, we want to row too.This is the reason why I believe that it is absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue to arrive safely, tin and qualify this very important reform.The many ideas that have been exhibited in this assembly could be divided into three main categories.First, some deputies and, in particular, Ms. Randzio-Plath, president of the Economic and Monetary Commission, are concerned whether this new legal exception system will be absolutely compatible with the Treaty.I share their concern and think that we have to examine this aspect.Second, the question of the legal security of companies arises.It is true, Mr. Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty.We all agree.But it is nonetheless true and all the groups of this assembly repeated it that the European industrial fabric is a fabric of small and medium -sized enterprises and that the Commission often plays a role of auctoritas, legitimization, legitimacy, of the domestic market.In this regard, I wish to express my opinion on the remarks made by Mr. Karas.There was only nine rejection decisions.But there, I will talk about my experience as a lawyer.How many times a lawyer with two companies and a project does not change this project, faced with an orientation of the ex ante commission, so that it is in accordance with these competition rules!This is an aspect that must be taken into account.Third, the problem of the uniform application of Community law arises.On this point, there is nothing to add to the excellent intervention of Ms. Thyssen.If biodiversity and cultural diversity are, in my opinion, a good thing, it is not the same for the diversity of application of the law, of what constitutes the essential nucleus of the internal market, namely, the law of competition.This point must still be tinned.Only some countries, such as Germany, have a specialized court.Perhaps it is a way to explore, but we need to explore others.What we cannot do, Mr. Commissioner and I would like to finish there is to lend the flank, to provide weapons to those who present European institutions as a case for the big, the powerful, the rich, and not for the citizens, the small and medium -sized enterprises, who would be subjected, in the worst case which will never materialize because the sufficient measures will be applied to avoid this situationDissemblables, very late and without any real possibility of controlling the situation if not by doing what the French call ""the obstacle course"", namely while waiting for I only know how many years the Luxembourg Court, which, as we know, is currently saturated, renders its judgment."	fr
I believe that the president of the Italian council spoke of this point during your interview on February 24.Can you tell us what is your position on this subject?Mr. President, Europe has been awakened with a start by Bosnia and Kosovo.The European Union finally realizes that it cannot afford to constantly let the Americans take political and military initiatives.The decision to set up an autonomous peacekeeping force is excellent.However, if Europe wishes to be able to intervene militarily in critical moments, a flexibility clause in the treaty must be provided.Mr. Solana can play a decisive role.It is not crazy, I can assure you!He is a passionate and competent man.It's just about knowing whether this accumulation of functions does not go beyond the skills.Mr. Solana is not only secretary general of the Council but also secretary general of the EUO, a high representative for foreign policy and head of the planning and rapid alert unit.Does So Solana still find time to sleep, Mr. President?To tell the truth, I find this accumulation of unacceptable functions from a democratic point of view, especially since Mr. Solana was not democratically elected: it is a senior official who has no accounts to be rendered to any parliament.His situation threatens to overshadow Commissioner Patten, as we have seen again today.Obviously, as the European security and defense policy takes shape, the Commission and the Parliament are less and less involved.I find this situation just as unacceptable.It is of course necessary to put everything to improve the effectiveness of European policy, but this cannot lead to unwanted concentrations of power.Solana must hold the eyes of Europe wide open without falling into sleep itself.Mr. President, the European Union was created above all to guarantee peace and I am satisfied that Commissioner Patten and Mr. Solana also underlined him several times.We have also opted for joint development, through the paths of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance.Today, however, we are powerless in the face of misfortune in Chechnya and indifferent to the wars that occur in Africa, in a large number of countries with which we have links since they are former colonies.They are part of our ACP partners.War is the continuity of decadent underdevelopment.We intervened militarily in Kosovo after being unable to prevent a war from breaking into the former Yugoslavia.Today, we are unable to maintain peace there.This is the reason why the European Union is not credible.I do not believe, Mr. Solana, that we can restore this credibility by the military route.As representatives of the European Free Alliance, we are all from nations, regions, who have never waged war with a foreign country but who have always had to defend themselves against their attackers.We are very skeptical about your current rapid training plans of an armed force, not because we would be opposed to a European defense, but because this defense should and can only result from an effective and democratic decision -making process.	fr
With regard to the type of projects to be promoted, one should also relocate the focus of small projects on earnings base, which are difficult to monitor, to investment projects in which the benefits are obvious in the majority of cases.This means that the calls can be met after more transparency when using the funds, and the temptation, the local tax revenue in areas in which corresponding projects are carried out unnecessarily over a long period of time is successfully counteracted.In addition, the parliament makes it clear how serious it takes the call for such reforms.These changes, if they are accepted by this high house today, are in my opinion another decisive step to achieve the historically significant goals, for which the funds had originally been set up, namely the financially sustainable support of the disadvantaged areas in the European Union in which the standard of living does not have to be raised by alms, but concrete help to a decent level.I ask the house to agree to these changes.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for her report developed with so much diligence and care.The structural policies and the cohesion policy of the European Union are undoubtedly the essential instruments in order to create the prerequisites for growth and reducing economic and social imbalances in the regions.Despite the previous measures, these imbalances are still quite pronounced, even unacceptable in terms of unemployment.In order for the goals of these politics to be implemented as comprehensively as possible, they must be coordinated and implemented on the basis of well -thought -out, sensible guidelines.Let us not forget that these policies, if they are effective, also become visible to the European citizen who recognizes an immediate improvement in his quality of life!We also consider that the remote and island regions of the European Union deserve special attention, because due to their geographical situation, they are considerably disadvantaged in their economic and social development - unless the commission intends to build bridges or to create a tunnel tunnel to connect them to the European mainland.Finally, let me note that the structural policies overall have to be made more flexible so that they meet the changed conditions and thus the new challenges and opportunities that the new millennium, for which we all hope the best, brings with it.Mr. President, Ms. Schroedter's report, undoubtedly contains numerous important information, and I would like to congratulate her.However, we should have the focus and the results of the regional policy of the community.Here are some problems: the enormous mass unemployment is not only not broken down, but also accepts worse dimensions within the framework of structural policy.As a result of the regional policy practiced, agriculture and agricultural regions suffer irreparable damage, which has ominous consequences for the employment in rural areas and the living conditions of farmers, especially in the south.The regional imbalances within the Member States potentiate in a scary manner.Based on the data of the sixth report, it becomes clear that the regional gradient has increased significantly in the past ten years.The enormous problems of the island regions of the Union, where the deficits in the infrastructure, traffic, communication and energy sectors lead to a continuous emigration of the population, almost no or no attention is paid at all.	de
Based on this fixed point of view, we also consider the time to demand increased efforts by the Commission and the Member States on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique.The one million euros made available is completely insufficient for the need for $ 65 million by the Mozambican government.The time has also come to demand more effectiveness.We hope that the debate, which was conducted this early afternoon, will lead to greater efforts for all pages in the help of Mozambique.President!The situation in Mozambique is of extreme drama.Every day, every hour of delay costs a lot of lives.There are only a few helicopters available for the rescue of tens of thousands of victims.The water increases inexorably.Farming and epidemics threaten.It looks as if the whole world watch out.The question is whether the Commission reacts quickly enough.To be honest, I have my doubts.Commissioner Nielson left to Mozambique today.This may be quick for European terms, but maybe very late for the emergency in Mozambique.In contrast to a number of member states, the European Union has so far only promised support to a very limited extent.What options does the Commission see to offer effective help quickly?What could immediate aid and the support for reconstruction look like?What can Commissioner Patten say about the previous international coordination?Why was it not possible to offer a larger number of helicopter rescue at an earlier point in time?The international community could certainly help Mozambique with generous debt.Not only because the country runs a relatively good policy, but above all because the extent of the human misery absolutely requires this.President!All reports and pictures that reach us are testified by the extent of the tragedy, which is affected by the Mozambique.Hundreds of thousands of people torn from their surroundings, numerous dead, a lack of food and drinking water, destroyed houses and harvest.And all of this in a country that is one of the poorest in the world and therefore does not have the slightest means to get the affected population groups with the necessary speed.Therefore, an intervention by the European Union and the corresponding Member States is imperative so that this country and this population are helped quickly and unscheduled.As is well known, the Portuguese presidency and Mr. Commissioner Nielson have come to Mozambique due to the drama of the situation.We are pleased with that.But even more than your presence there, it is urgently needed to immediately decide and implement a short and medium-term action program and to carry out in cooperation with the Mozambican bodies with which the help that requires the situation.Incidentally, today I have in this sense and in the conviction that it is now required to be quick and unusual to act, before your departure in my capacity as chairman of the committee for development and cooperation to Mr. Commissioner Nielson and asked him to sit down with us immediately after his return and to inform us about the development of the situation and especially about the immediate measures that have already been taken by the European Union.	de
"In the future - and this is already the case today - retirees will have considerable sums of money.Unlike the young people who are closed, the elderly have raised a capital they want to make fruit and they therefore have interest in this directive.If national governments attached importance - as the European Union attaches it in this directive - to the multiplication of money earned during professional life, the explosive problem of pensions would have already been resolved.Mr. Bolkestein, in your capacity as a commissioner, you carry a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and retirees, a future which, I hope, will be better once we have developed this directive, namely very soon, as Ms. Villiers and Kauppi proposed.Mr. President, that it was first allowed to me, on behalf of the Commission, to send my warm thanks to the rapporteur, Olle Schmidt, and to the members of the Economic and Monetary Commission, seized on the merits, as well as to the Rapporteur, Brian Crowley, and to the members of the Legal Commission and the internal market that I would like to thank for their activity as detailed as it is important in order to refine and expand proposals.Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment fund sector has experienced a long development and it is now important to modernize its rules.The new proposals aim at a maximum level of protection of investors, which forms an essential condition for the integration of markets which stems from the introduction of the euro.Given that the average European family places its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions in terms of prudent management - and I want to insist on this point - cautious management with regard to the investment and risk distribution policy.The two proposals form a coherent whole.The first proposal expands the number of instruments in which a ""collective placement organization of securities"" - an UCITS - can invest.As has already been noted in this assembly, UCITS are among the major players in the modern capital markets.Their presence offers the possibility for a large number of traditional investors to take part in these markets, taking into account the principle of distribution of risks accompanied by adequate control.Diversified investment forms being authorized, private investors can also take advantage of all the advantages of new investment techniques.The second proposal expands the role that these important intermediate institutions can play in the European Union capital markets with regard to the development of the investment fund sector.If we authorize the constitution of branches and the establishment of certain services on the cross -border level, these institutions will finally be able to use freedoms granted by the Treaty of Rome which they were deprived during all these years.The Commission welcomes a number of clarifications proposed by the Economic and Monetary Commission and will resume a large number of its ideas.The Commission will take up the amendments - and I use the numbering in its most recent form - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 in the first proposal and 23, 28 and 32 to the second proposal, since they are very useful clarifications and improvements."	fr
"This is the great challenge, the great importance of the Lisbon Summit. I wish to deal with only a couple of basic aspects that will help us achieve this goal, to make theory act. First, there is a commitment to the existence of real criteria, for a true equitable examination process, to set goals, real achievement goals, for the consent of governments to attempt a particularly courageous process by saying: ""Yes, we will allow us to assess us.""This is indeed a brave decision, because some Member States will obviously find themselves in the last series of the evaluation table, which is not liked by anyone. However, this is important if we want to have a truly feasible result from this Lisbon Summit, rather than starting another course - a course that I know does not want to attempt by Prime Minister Gutnerrez, because he really wants to achieve results during the Lisbon Summit. There are other areas that we should consider. One of them is the challenge for creating an electronic Europe that will include all its citizens and will not neglect anyone. Another is about the process of actually achieving a true single market - which we do not yet - and to acquire skills that will be the key to realizing this society of innovation and knowledge. These are difficult choices, but I would like these people who are here in the theory tonight and listening to this particular debate to leave with the belief that we will really have a society that will be based on full -time employment, that the road to Lisbon will be the end of our journey and that it will be the end of our journey. I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive region. Who could oppose such an ambition? However, I must say that dynamism and entrepreneurship, as well as social cohesion, are a very ambitious goal, not to mention the creative tension between these two goals. I hope we will succeed, but I also express a warning. I note the other ambitious goal of playing a role in the early cyber organization. I can't avoid thinking that it's probably too late! I applaud the emphasis on the strengthening of research and development in Europe, on the development of content industries and to accelerate broad zone networks along with all that our practical pursuit of knowledge society entails. In fact, I would prefer to call it a ""economy of information"" because the economic aspect is the most important. We live in the IDEA (Internet Digital Electronic Age) - in the digital online era of the Internet. This summarizes what we strive to achieve on the electronic side of life. However, I applaud the fact that this summit is also intended to place a wider emphasis on reforms of our economies in Europe to improve competitiveness and innovation."	el
"If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient, and it obviously underestimated, it must be increased.Our resolution requests it.If the increase is insufficient, the polluter will have to finance the balance.It would be particularly unfair to see an oil company, whose profits are rising this year at ten billion francs, refusing to compensate its own victims 100 %, the vast majority of which are made up of small businesses and employees.The populations experienced, the Commissioner, are waiting for the European solidarity brands to be manifested at the European level.Our resolution asks the Commission to take necessary measures to help repair the damage caused in the fishing sector affected by the consequences of the disaster.Bleue Europe, the PCP, must show today that, beyond the constraints it inflicts on fishermen, solidarity is not a word that it ignores.The European Union must also participate in the restoration of environments in wetlands and affected coastal areas whose biological value interests the entire Union.Mr. Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France's requests and I welcome it.We have, in this essential file of marine pollution, to play a role of sting.Twenty after the AMOCO Cadiz disaster, it is indeed always laxity and irresponsibility that reign supreme in Europe in terms of maritime security, with their fruits, new black tides.This time, inertia should not prevail.A general framework in terms of maritime security must be quickly defined by respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and it must finally be put an end to this infernal spiral of generalized irresponsibility.Mr. President, the economy of the Western Atlantic is disaster, Mazoutée by the fuel of the Erika.Fishermen, oyster farmers, conchyls, tourism professionals, local and territorial communities are getting impatient while waiting for aid and the treatment of the wreckage which, apparently, always flees and constitutes a real time bomb.Europe, which has unfortunately removed the budget line, ""natural disasters for the benefit of member countries"", must react.React first in the name of solidarity, but also in the name of its share of responsibility in this umpteenth black tide.Indeed, citizens do not understand why Europe accepts what Americans refuse and why Europe, usually so quick to legislate in terms of environment, has so far ignored maritime security.Europe must legislate as soon as possible and shed light on this sinking.But in the meantime, the Commission must urgently mobilize European funds to help disaster companies, treat the wreckage, clean the coast, increase waste storage capacity, ensure their treatment or recycling, establish a research program on oil collection at sea. Finally, the Commission must restore a substantial budget line, ""natural disasters for member countries"", make the structural funds.What is the opinion of the Commission on these proposals?What are the decisions already made and those that the commission intends to take?"	fr
The European Parliament is in favor of this initiative, but only regrets that we must accept the initiative resolution, even though we have not yet obtained results for the Interreg II assessment. However, we are aware that the implementation of the third initiative is not to be postponed, otherwise we would jeopardize the success of several projects and the continuity of many projects, as Interreg's success is clear, and this is also believed to be the local, regional and national authorities who have participated in joint funded projects. Learning together, renewing, implementing projects together and sharing good practices, understanding and tolerating each other are some of the things this initiative teaches to those who participate in it. The initiative involves many interesting questions, such as the follow -up center, the principle of centralization ... However, I would like to focus on talking about governing bodies. It is important to try to find common regional and cross -border governing bodies, where all local and regional authorities, economic and social actors, could participate. It is no longer worthwhile to carry out similar projects on both sides of the border. It is important to create a cross -border culture, and for this, it is important to make reforms in the field of administrative cooperation and to exceed the existing walls, exceeding the difficulties of each Member State, each area and every municipality. The implementation of the project must not fail to make dialogue difficult. In discussions in the committee, we have also noted the difficulties of coordinating Interreg and other annual or two -year financial instruments such as Meda, Tacis or Phare. The Parliament's proposal for resolution has paid much attention to these problems and the Commission requests proposals to solve the problems and to set reasonable deadlines to make the necessary changes. Mr President, the reason I want to participate in this debate is that the Urban initiative has been quite a success, especially in Ireland, and I think it would be important for the European Union to continue their participation in this area. It is sad that many hundreds, even thousands, living areas in the European Union suffer from severe poverty and poor starting points. Even in those Member States and cities, which are very prosperous, a large number of people live on their own islands without proper services in areas with poor school system where physical infrastructure is underdeveloped and drugs and other nasty phenomena are common. If the European Union wants to show that it has its own role in helping the European Union's citizens, I think it must provide it to Member States to show that the Union works for the benefit of citizens and their families. The program has been very successful in Ireland and I know it has succeeded in other countries. Getting started was quite slow, but the slowness was due to the need to get local people involved in developing these programs. It is important that people use their own initiative and their local expertise to develop this initiative. It would be quite easy to get these programs developed quickly and on schedule by bringing outside professional experts, but that would be contrary to the purpose of the entire Urban program. Before I quit, I would like to mention one thing: we should hold on to where these support money is being addressed and where this program is being developed would be carried out within a serious Urban development policy. Unfortunately, in Ireland, this has not happened to Anna's full support for the innovative approach of the Equal program and the goal of bringing marginalized groups into the labor market. Development partnerships are a pretty good idea, even though they are experimental. However, in the case of development partners, I am concerned about two important things. They should be accessible to small groups to develop, implement and monitor programs in these groups. We need great flexibility in the program.	fi
We discussed how important it is for the Commission to develop a group of main goals for non-military activities related to crisis, and if it is allowed to me, I would say that if this ever applies to a case, the catastrophe that has been tested by a mosambicism is just that. Next, I will be able to deal with the help we provide for the time being. Last week, the European Community Humanitarian Aid Office (ECHO) decided to show EUR 1 million flood help, of which 600,000 will be distributed through the Spanish Red Cross and 150,000 Luxembourg MSF for grant measures and EUR 250,000 through the German Red Cross to Botswana. These NGOs take the most urgent action, that is, to transfer people in danger to safer areas, to provide health services, water and to be responsible for cleaning. Echo is currently preparing a second decision on additional assistance of EUR 2 million. The implementation of this decision is provided by Unicef, Action Contre La Faim, Cosv, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid, which, of course, requires that their final proposals be submitted to us and that they are found to be good. These NGOs intend to focus on organizing water supply, cleaning and accommodation, as well as the supply of plastic coats, canisters and blankets and anything else. They also intend to focus on the repatriation of people who are left home, preventing additional measures to prevent the onset of malaria, cholera and other infectious diseases, supplementing additional food to those with malnutrition and those who are threatening to supply seeds and tools, food safety, the essentials of animal welfare, and the rest of the important structures of the animal's well -being. The third decision must be examined from the point of view of the Commission Member Nielson's trip. The Commission is also currently being prepared by a medium -term community project that combines non -governmental financing with the actions of the European Development Fund to help Mozambique to cope with the crisis situation and get economic growth again rapidly. It is planned that this project would become a reconstruction aid after the current emergency phase. The schedule would be three to four years. In such times, we all know how much more work we need to do to prevent disasters and act quickly in the event of disasters we cannot prevent. I'm not sure that at this point, I have no use when analyzing what went wrong and what we could do better, but it is clear that we have to take all the doctrine out of this terrible accident. I also repeat that the Commission member Nielson is pleased to be able to report to Parliament after returning from Mozambique and accident. Mr President, Dear Member of the Commission, Good Colleagues, Mozambik, is a young African country who, like a Cycloop, has been recovering from the backward of the two decades of civil war and to adapt to democracy. The success story of Mozambique is due to efforts, which must be honored even between its government, its opposition, and especially the people of the Mozambique. But the results of all the efforts made in recent years are in danger after the hardships of the peace agreement we all know to be drowned in the natural rage that has hit Mozambique in recent weeks. The recent numeric information that comes with the dimension of the catastrophe is startling, as the commission member has already said: nearly one million people have remained homeless, over a hundred thousand people are on the roofs of their houses or in the trees waiting for a helicopter to rescue them. There are already a few hundred dead. The European Union and many of its Member States, among them, have already offered financial emergency aid, perhaps a little late, but they have done it, as are the United States and many countries in the area, especially South Africa. At the moment, it is obvious that the most important of the first distress are rescue helicopters and immediately after food grants and other humanitarian emergency assistance. These floods started three weeks ago, and finally the whole world has begun to wake up to the screaming emergency of Mozambique: the spirit of thousands of people will rely on the thread and they will soon unless we arrange for them, above all, air transportation equipment, for them.	fi
The Commission insists on the need to examine the said requests from the point of view of their safety and their effectiveness before granting an authorization.I can only ask you again to keep in mind the technical nature of the commission proposal and to wait for the independent proposal for a new directive concerning the additives in food to approach larger questions.I would like to examine some of the specific problems that have been raised during the debate.First of all, with regard to the observations made by Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, I would like to ensure that we will modify the authorization procedure for genetically modified additives in Directive 70/524 concerning additives and not in the Novel Food directive.It is a directive whose object concerns more particularly raw materials than additives.The text mentioned by the Parliament comes from the directive which was adopted in 1998. However, the vertical legislation of Directive 90/220 relating to the way of evaluating the environmental risks of GMOs has been modified since then and is still today.It is subject to the second reading in Parliament.I am convinced that we should wait for the final version of Directive 90/220 and more particularly, from its article 11. It has also been referred to the question of whether this proposal could generate a risk of establishing monopolies.Mr. Kindermann and Mrs. Auroi raised this question.I would just like to make some comments on this question.First of all, this project has been in progress since 1993, and we cannot therefore say that it has taken short any other producer of goods.Indeed, any applicant of this type can always submit his request relating to a particular product.I also wish to underline the fact that the commission has never approved any request for authorization from GMOs intended to be included in additives.Ms. Roth-Behrendt referred to the question of the appropriate legal basis, namely whether this basis was to reside in article 37 or in article 152. Again, I repeat what I have already declared previously on this point and I assure it, as well as the Assembly, that it would be extremely inappropriate on the part of the Commission to seek a measure taken on the basis of article 37of the provision any reference to public health.It is a problem that has been examined on at least two times by the European Court of Justice, which established the legal criteria for situations identical to the present situation, which require the consideration of the appropriate legal basis at the time of the presentation of a legislative text.The courtyard of the court appears to be completely explicit on this point.As a general commentary on the amendments suggested here, particularly with regard to the problem of the legal basis, it would be inappropriate to base the legal basis on article 152 in these circumstances, because this would most certainly be likely to be contrary to the objective criteria that have been defined by the Court.A number of you - M. Nicholson in particular - have referred to the problem relating to labeling.	fr
The adoption of this report will have serious consequences for European agriculture if the concentration of phosphorus and nitrogen, for example, cannot exceed the basic values ​​for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a value close to zero is established for pesticides in the aquatic environment.European farmers will not be able, for example, no longer produce panic -up wheat containing a high level of protein for the manufacture of bread.This will result in a relocation of agricultural production to other countries outside the EU and there will be significant social costs as well as in terms of employment.I cannot accept the parts of the water directive concerning these points.Mr. President, dear colleagues, water is a precious resource.Millions of human beings do not even have pure water, an essential condition for survival.We must therefore not surprise that the water is at the base of wars.The capitalist world also places its pawns to take maximum control of water reserves.In this area, there is rarely about any general interest or solidarity.Europe is therefore confronted with a difficult task: to bring together community policy in the field of water in a more coherent legislative framework, fragmented both in terms of objectives and terms of means.I must admit that in my country too, Flanders, the road to go is still long.Recently again, the commission hit us on our fingers on this subject.Any sensible person wants this framework directive to be used as a sword in the kidneys of political leaders who are guilty of shortcomings at present.In this regard, the common position is a farce, an informal work, a real affront to the OSPAR agreements.We are faced with an implementation period which can be extended up to 34 years.My children will then be older than I am now.Recognize it: it's not serious.Tomorrow we can vote for a weak and informal framework that will poison the future of our children.Or, we will vote for the amendments of my group, the rapporteur or the environment commission.This is again to conclude.In recent months, we have exerted enormous pressure on us.What strikes in this case is the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers.In my country, it was done as well by the Flemish administration as Walloon in charge of the environment.They opted for the low common position rather than for the more ambitious positioning of our parliament.I really wonder if this approach is known to the green ministers of the environment in place in my country.Dear colleagues, the beautiful words are no longer enough.We must resolutely change CAP.During the vote of tomorrow, we can clearly show that Europe is working on a responsible and future policy in the field of water.This can only increase our credibility.The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	fr
"(In) The Commission supports any efforts to settle the disputes between Turkey and Armenia and regrets that relations between the two countries have not yet been smoothed. In the present political conditions, however, it is not realistic to imagine that the border between Armenia and Turkey, as well as between Armenia and Azerbaijan, could open without arrangement of Nagorno-Karabakh's conflict. Mr President, the Commission will also negotiate in the future the issue of Turkey's accession to the European Union. Will it put as a condition that the negotiations can only start when the financial exclusion is lifted? Because we are all ultimately neighbors and we want to cultivate good neighboring relations within the European Union. So I ask if the Commission will put this condition to improve future discussions.(In) The main issue is to support the efforts of the OSCE Minsk team to settle the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, and we are ready to help in any way we can. We have also contributed substantially to development assistance under the Tacis program for Armenia. Let me link my answer especially to the issue of Turkish accession to the European Union. Turkey's relations with its neighbors will be examined extensively, as the honorable MP calls for, in the context of the pre -accessible strategy. As mentioned in Agenda 2000 - and quoted - ""Enlargement does not mean to introduce border disputes"". This statement could not be clearer. But I reiterate that our most important contribution is to try to help resolve this conflict, which had such harmful results from an economic and humanitarian point of view. Question No.38 by K. (H-740/00): Subject: The impact of the construction of Ilisu Dam on Turkey on human rights as Turkey has recently been recognized as a candidate country, what is the committee's view on the impact on the human rights of the construction of Ilisu Dam?(In) The Commission has no information on the impact of the construction of the Ilisu Dam on the population of the area. However, we will consider discussing the matter with the Turkish authorities, along with other issues related to regional development policies, in the context of the pre -accessible strategy for Turkey. I have to make a relative observation. It concerns the consequences of the dam accessing fresh water throughout the area. As you know, the dam will limit freshwater supply to Syria and Iraq in particular. Given the excellent volatility in the area and the real concerns of many commentators that there will be increased incidents of conflict, the so -called ""waters of waters"", in the coming decades, what is the Commission's opinion on the possible destabilization that will cause it? Can you say whether you really hurt this point?(In), of course, we will refer to the observation made by the honorable MP."	el
"But I'm optimistic. Dear Mr President, the agenda of the intergovernmental conference must be expanded. The most important issue to be added to it is the internal differentiation of the Aegean. It is regrettable that in the European Parliament, not even here, the internal diversification of the Aegoni, which is essential for the Aegosi to be expanded, has almost been examined in depth in the specified manner. Former Commission President Jacques Delors has publicly re -promoted the idea of ​​a European Confederation. He also said that the first wave of countries on the brink of accession should be able to move faster than the other countries, and that for the sake of distinction this wave of countries should have its own institutions. The current President of the Commission Mr. Prodi and the Supreme Spokesman Mr. Solana have expressed similar thoughts. The European Party of Liberal Democrats and Reformers has taken a position on the internal diversification of the Aegean in a statement adopted last November, in which we proposed a system of concentric circles for Europe, the ""onion model"". In the next resolution on the SA, Parliament should seriously and in -depth examine the issue of differentiation and flexibility. Both the enlargement and the achievements of integration will be tested if we cannot create the system of concentric circles proposed by the Liberal Group. Colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken with some skepticism about certain aspects of the discussion. I also want to add my own concern about the auxiliary, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own internal self -governing areas. It was not sufficiently careful, and there are many things that inspire concern. I would like to pay particular attention to one of the impact of enlargement with regard to the European Parliament. It has been determined that the number of Members of Parliament may be safely up to a maximum of 700, in order to remain an assembly of important discussions. By applying the existing principle of intercourse, that is, six seats for each state plus one additional seat per five hundred thousand inhabitants, we are already being led to the situation where Luxembourg, with a population of 367,000, has more Members of the European Parliament than Wales. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in the European Parliament at present. Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen. Imagine now what is going to happen if we maintain a ceiling of 700 Members, gradually increasing the population by 26%, and if we follow, in my opinion, in my opinion, the Commission's proposal, under which there should be a European list of candidates. What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will completely disappear! Under these circumstances, Members of the European Parliament should not be surprised by the fact that in these discussions some from Scotland and other such countries are demanding that the expansion and form of acceptance of new Member States coming from the existing ones are being taken."	el
In addition, Europe is the main destination for third countries, although it must respond to an increasingly tighter competition and an increasingly special and more attractive offer. As the Treaties do not provide for any particular legal basis for creating a real entity tourism policy, the European Union must promote and encourage cooperation in this field, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to demonstrate in practice the resources offered by tourism. Vocational training and labor mobility are essential tools for European unemployment strategy, especially for tourism service providers, in order to meet the multicultural demands of demand and guarantee the appropriate services to customers. Tourism jobs are often very seasonal and temporary, preventing it from sustainable development. Thus, it is even more urgent to achieve and disseminate skill in business management and technology in order to favor new production methods and promote the best -in -market tourism offerings. Member States should introduce favorable tax measures for SMEs in order to reduce the work that is particularly affected by the work, as shown in the report. This would be an excellent way to promote the increase in employment in very labor -intensive sectors and thus in the field of tourism. This industry is also crucial to the economic and social development of the most unfavorable regions: I especially think of the most outrageous areas and archipelago areas, the strengths of which cannot be denied in the industry. We must not forget that in the most remote areas, tourism is the most profitable industry branch. The income from tourism and the resulting employment will significantly reduce imbalances and encourage their economies to converge the middle level of community development. In addition, tourism can promote a certain kind of cultural and economic convergence, as it provides more information about different European cultures and thus promotes the development of respect for European life. So it is clear that tourism, if prudently in the long term, needs to represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while protecting and valuing the wealth of landscape, culture, history and the environment. Finally, I want to emphasize the primary position of the European Union, which it should be in favor of new forms of tourism in new places: I think specifically, and especially that European and continent residents should meet the most distant European tourist destinations, the remote areas of the community. Mr President, we have been discussing a very small issue for a long time, as in the end the discussion is based on the Commission's disclosure, which is a continuation of the high -level group conclusions and recommendations of the high -level group of tourism and employment. And we have not discussed only the little thing, but we have discussed on the basis of a slightly outdated document, as the document dates back to April 28, 1999, that is, it is almost a year old. The document is inherited from the previous Commission and is undoubtedly the result of the work of Papoutsis, a member of the Commission. After all, he did this work throughout his term, and culminated in the Luxembourg Summit and his failed Philoxenia program. In my opinion, this is the first discussion that we will hold in Parliament in the presence of a new Commission and a new Commission in the presence of a new Commission. Nonetheless, the said member of the Commission seems to listen quite precisely about what we discuss. I would like to take the opportunity to ask you two things directly from you. First, the inter -governmental conference is about to begin, and the governments participating in the Conference in Maastrich in 1992 undertakes to include in the agreements of the legal basis;This commitment was not fulfilled in the Amsterdam Treaty in 1997 and has not been implemented, and last June gave a resolution on tourism and employment last June. What are the expectations of a member of the Commission that this issue be taken into account in the new inter -governmental conference? The second question is much more straightforward and perhaps more challenging: If you take into account the failed efforts of the last decade, which Koch commented on, does a member of the Commission, who will be able to do something during his or her term, that this community tourism industry would be the target of proper politics, especially if we consider the prior speakers that have been the same?	fi
"In short, what are the benefits of armed troops if no policy even exists? We are now relying on some degree of a substitute for humanitarian rights, an army who feeds vague thoughts and ideologies, but the history of which has been revealed countless times. We must have a clear understanding of the nature and goals of foreign policy. However, a common foreign and security policy can always be used as an excuse for defending national interests that are already dominating the entire system. Who would not see that this is a couple of London and Berlin, with their tail hanging with both faithful supporters who do not make any difference between their diplomacy and Washington's diplomacy, and at best, small factors. For you, the highly high representative of you, Solan, is a very good idea of ​​this, let's say ""structural brotherhood"", because you put NATO and a common foreign and security policy on the same line as if it was the same thing, but in fact, you think it is the same thing. It is always about pursuing the interests of some great power. It is also quite amusing that you have actually appealed to that pretty delicious, almost delightful argument in the miserable race that puts you against the Commission member Patten. Namely, you may have recently shuffled to a German magazine that the Americans will contact you. You could have added, good solena, that they give you those regulations, because so we see it. Ball and other countries in Balkan applies to the rule that one day Americans demanded us to destroy the Balkans, the other they demanded us to repair the damage. Member Jean-Claude Martinez did it right when he interrupted you, member Daniel Cohn-Binds, because in all these cases it is humiliation. You will definitely consider me an exaggerator! However, our humiliation will receive additional confirmation of daily news. The Echelon Espainfall system is just one example among others, but it gives Europe a completely different picture than what we want to cherish here. Experts talk about a cultural problem, which is already quite affectionate. A high representative of foreign and security policy, I have to say to you on behalf of the European right-wing groups that you do not enjoy our trust. You claim to oppose the war, but as NATO Secretary General you have started one. You started the invasion war and slavery in the US military policy in an area that does not even belong to the NATO Treaty, a country that has never been a member of NATO and has not threatened any international border. The launch of the war meant not only the violation of the rules of international law, which is based on the principle not to interfere with internal states, but also the violation of the rules governing war declaration. Today, even a member of Cohn -Bends has evaluated this catastrophic policy - as he calls it - the consequences. Therefore, we would like to ask you some questions that, to put it mildly, reveal what we are concerned about. First of all, I think the goal of a common foreign and security policy is to protect the safety of the Member States of the Union, as one might think, or can you think that in the name of a common foreign and security policy can you intervene in any country? Secondly, I would ask: What are the rules of international law and political morality that you rely on? I can already imagine your answer: Humanitarian reasons. Serbia's entire civilian infrastructure was destroyed in Kosovo for the name of humanitarian causes. When the United States sees 2000 people by fucking, it is supposed to take place in the name of drug smuggling, not to pushing US politics there. Of course, when the United States attacks Somali, which they are embarrassed, of course, it is not because the United States wants to retain its grip on the country's oil resources, but because it brings hope to the country."	fi
The first sustainable development plans will undoubtedly be here. Mr President, Madam Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would first like to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann on the report she prepared as well as the committee - why not - why this report, this post, generally improves the applicable texts. In addition, it has a more acceptable system and is characterized by greater clarity and transparency. I would also like to congratulate the Commission's services, as the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE program ensure the selection and execution of the programs to a large extent. But there are aspects that I would like to insist on. First, in terms of its continuity, which I do not first dispute. Secondly, in terms of funding. Unfortunately, only 7.2% of the programs submitted receive funding. Of the € 1,919 million, only € 784 million were subsidized. And now only 613 million euros are displayed in the financial bulletin for more countries and more responsibilities. Parliament proposed EUR 850 million, but the document repeats the first proposal, which amounts to 613. Mrs Commissioner, the environmental liabilities are increasing in all areas, and the only financial means dedicated exclusively to the environment is degraded. Is this a contradiction? Do we demand from others what we are not willing to offer? Why are we all happy to talk about the environment, but we are not willing to pay and want to pay and maintain those who always took care of it, those who live there all year? Madam Commission, let's be consistent. The cost of maintaining the environment, from which we all benefit, must be borne by everyone, and the LIFE program is the only financial means intended exclusively for the environment and whose programs have generally been effective. Mr President, LIFE is the community tool since 1992 to support and develop environmental policy both within the community and regional with third countries. Based on the experiences gained over the last eight years, it is sought to increase the effectiveness of the environmental actions in the third phase of development of this financial instrument. Funding actions for the implementation, adjustment and development of Community environmental policy, as well as the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as the contribution to sustainable development, is centralized by the regulation. In the thematic life, which mainly aims at the implementation of the Nature Network 2000, it is important to introduce the multinational approach to drawing up international projects and actions to avoid fragmentation of habitats and to enhance the protection of biodiversity. In the second theme, life -by -case, which concerns more demonstration projects in favor of the industry of small and medium -sized businesses and local authorities, there is clearly the integration of the environment into other policies. Regarding the financial file for the implementation of LIFE for the next five years, I am categorically in favor of increasing from € 613 million to 850, as suggested by rapporteur Lienemann.	el
"Unless you do not take care of the same access conditions for everyone to the postal services, but only think about the capital utilization conditions for companies in large agglomeration centers.However, MPs should be representatives of all citizens, and that means that they are obliged not to think economically but economically.This means specifically for postal services: First, the question of employment must have priority.I have nothing against liberalization and privatization, but the premises have to be right.Second, it must be guaranteed that there is no reduction in services for the citizen.Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this danger exists.Mr. Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which the prices after the liberalization have decidedly gone more strongly than in all other Member States of this European Union.This is also an effect that can arise.We have to make sure that this does not happen.Thirdly: Firstly, the universal postal service remains at a affordable price for every citizen, in every place, secondly, the retention of a unit price for all Member States, and thirdly, a daily postal delivery and collection on working days.In the question of the price-performance ratio for the respective weight classes of mailings, you can think about further price reductions;The Swiss Post itself says.One does not have to stay at over 300g, the analysis states that a minimum of 150g must be guaranteed so that this still pays off.I think the discussion was correct and important today so that Mr. Bolkestein knows how this parliament positions itself so that it can take into account things from the outset.President!In the first revision phase of Directive 97/67/EC, we are about postal services, and further liberalization, as I fear, would lead to a significant reduction in the services subject to the common good.At the hearing of Mr. Bolkestein, my colleague Véronique Mathieu said the wish that impact studies should be carried out for each proposal immediately after his announcement, so that the effects of the planned liberalization are known before the legal provisions are determined.What is the current state of affairs?Is the result of these impact studies available?As is well known, we, the EDD MPs, together with other members, defend life in rural areas, i.e. the preservation of jobs and the social cohesion, which is reinforced by the provision of a high-quality universal service.I would be happy to say that due to the examples to be determined daily in my country, in my very rural region, can be passed on to another liberalization phase without concern.Unfortunately, this is not the case, and if the European directive together with the French 35 -hour law that changes the working time criteria -for example 1,700 per hour is used to be processed in the hour compared to 1,400 -in our country either, the opening times for public transport are shortened, or certain post offices will be closed.This already means a unacceptable reduction in the service subject to the common good.I have the local newspaper of my community here, in which I read: ""The post office tells the population that from January 3, 2000 - this is very topical - the last emptying will take place at 3:45 p.m. and not as before""."	de
"I therefore believe that this point, which alone justifies an extended revision, must be registered urgently on the agenda of the CIG.In our opinion, the central questions that must currently be asked, with regard to the convocation of an intergovernmental conference for the revision of the treaties far exceed the controversy raised here concerning the dimension of its agenda, the possibility of formulating or not proposals of new subjects to be included or the level of participation of the Parliament.The important questions relate, in our view, on the possibilities and objectives of the CIG but also on the themes which will be debated there.We doubt his possibilities because it is that the objectives in sight are far from agreeing with the planned enlargement to which we keep referring.This is what emerges in particular from the content targeted, in particular with regard to the unrelated points in Amsterdam - which announced the subsequent formation of unacceptable directorates - but also with regard to those who refer to the second and third pillars, which begin to take place, particularly in the sense of an undesirable militarization of the European Union.These are several of the essential reasons for which we are not in favor of the proposal for resolution that we are now studying.The European Parliamentary Labour Group has abstained with regard to the final vote on the Leinen-Dimitrakopoulos report.The text is exaggeratedly ambitious and European deputies from the British Labor Party believe that the CIG should give priority to the Locks of Amsterdam in order to prepare the enlargement and should not extend beyond these objectives.Important work is currently underway in terms of reform and this must constitute, for the time being, priority in order to allow the consolidation and strengthening of EU institutions.The extension of the agenda and a drastic revision of the treaties would cause a risk of destabilization.The key element, in this text, as it was amended, is the appeal launched in favor of a charter of fundamental rights to be included in the treaties.In our view, this would cause a complex legislative charge and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter explaining to the citizens what their rights are.Our priorities must be: the number and responsibility of the commissioners The weighting of the vote within the council The extension of the qualified majority vote in the fields which will benefit in the United Kingdom and to Europe (but not the modifications of treatments, defense issues, border controls or taxation) and the extension of codecision in all areas to which the qualified majority vote is extended.Beyond that, we worry about what suggestions for ""flexibility"" and reinforced cooperation are not appropriate for the moment.Amsterdam's provisions, to a large extent, have not been put to the test and the fact of giving an increasing place to opt-outs could weaken the EU when we consider enlargement and where candidate countries are asked to subscribe to the single market and to the rest of European legislation..(SV) In order to influence development, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda of the intergovernmental conference that what emerges from this resolution, which, to too much extent, is concerned with the disappointment and negativism regarding the decision taken by the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999."	fr
Competition policy is now facing huge challenges that will hopefully be able to cope with, as probably many of these mergers will be aimed at protecting corporate profit margins from competition rather than to improve productivity and expand their business. Commission member Montilla and his colleagues are facing a major challenge, and we want in the ELDR group that the competition policy would not be impaired in terms of fusion and the control of competition restrictions. It is very good to transfer the responsibility to the national authorities, but we would emphasize that the rapporteur von Wogau said in his report that national authorities should be regularly monitored so that the communality would not be impaired, and that we would specifically ask a member of the Commission to convince us that this would be secured by the sisting tests. Mr President, in the very short time I have at the time I want, I want to support the work done by all the presenters, and I agree with many of the issues mentioned here, especially my colleague Jonckheer's review of excessive summary of data and the need for transparency and socio -economic review. I also agree with the criticism that the development of Article 82 has not been emphasized, especially as we have been able to detect abuse as the market focuses. As a member of the Basque Country Parliament, I want to give my full support for the application of the appropriate market competition. I say this in case it was unclear because we have criticized the Commission in general, and in particular the Commission member Montia for taking the incentives given to basketball companies and considered them state. Our disagreement is based on the fact that the Commission still does not understand the nature of the general system and solidarity of the economic agreement granted to the Basque Country, which is why the tax rules of the Basque Country are similar in nature, basic and goals to the rules of the Union and are generally applied to all taxpayers. Mr President, Member of the Commission, yes, we need competition! We need competition for the lowest unemployment, highly exported health care, social justice, high social standards and, of course, we also need - these are economic competition criteria - business competition: the best quality of the products, the conditions for all companies and the environmental -friendly products. This means that we must succeed in combining the competitive criteria that are economically essential to the business criteria. I sometimes have the impression that, unlike in my country, former DDR, where economic competitiveness was preceded by everything else and the business competitiveness was ignored, nowadays very often the opposite and society thinks almost exclusively in business. I say this to you as an entrepreneur who is absolutely interested. However, the system cannot work! It can only succeed by combining both criteria. I give you one example: The European Union has reasonably supported the Grönitz steel factory in the German Brandenburg state, although only 700 of its 5,000 jobs remain. However, they are competitive jobs, as this steel factory is now the second largest manufacturer of tool steel in Germany. The one who now endangers the production of this steel factory, which is then required by the then subsidies, is not only endangered by the steel factory itself, but the employer of the area, which is of course dependent on many small and medium -sized enterprises. Of course, it cannot be the competition policy of the European Union! If we want competition, we must succeed in combining economic needs and business conditions. This is also the only opportunity to create regional economic cycles in the underdeveloped areas, leading to the social social situation to be safeguarded and that purchasing power is enhanced. Thus, we need to take out demand -oriented economic policy clearly more strongly than the mere offering economic policy! Mr President, after being elected to the Parliament in 1994, I have never seen a report that would have such anti -Irish attitudes and shades as in the Jonckheer report we discussed today.	fi
The Van Hulten report represents progress, but it is not enough.In addition, we must clarify the roles that are ours in the field of account surveillance.The Court of Auditors must verify to what extent such or such element of the financial functioning of the EU could be incompatible with the regulations, but it does not amount to control the compliance of expenses with the objectives set.It is the European Parliament which is responsible for political evaluation.Our work is not to hunt for bandits - it is that of Olaf.Let me be told, for example, which national parliament obtains all the documents relating to prior surveys!I would therefore like to repeat, with all the obstinacy which I am capable of, that the provision on access to information and documentation must be significantly improved in relation to the text projects that we have been able to consult on the Internet, failing which this fight will not lead anywhere.Mr. President, I would like to sincerely thank the rapporteur for his report.I am happy to be able to contact him in Dutch, now that Mr. Van Den Berg did, otherwise I would probably have had some scruples.I find that this report brings a famous improvement, especially through amendments.I am part of the employment and social affairs committee and with us, a rapporteur is always proud to receive a hundred amendment proposals because it means that he has raised an interesting problem.I think that is the case in this case, although it is in my opinion exaggerated to extend too long over these hundred amendments.I will add that our coordinator to the budget control commission is Mr. Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and who has therefore made this debate a very considerable Spanish contribution.Mr. President, I find that there is one essential thing among the important elements that have been cited, it is the proposal to appoint a rapporteur for the Standing Committee for the Control of Public Administrations.It is a proposal of first importance.I am only surprising that the socialist group wants to eliminate this proposal by means of another proposal emanating from Ms. Morgan, because it actually wants to delete it completely.I don't understand where she is coming from.On the one hand, we hear all kinds of praises about the rapporteur and, simultaneously, Ms. Morgan wants to continue a sort of burnt earth strategy, both on this specific point but also on a certain number of other important points elsewhere, which has the effect of emptying its substance.I don't know if the goal is to meet Mr. Kinnock.In any case, I know Mr. Kinnock.Mr. Kinnock is willing to hear our expectations, but is just as ready to dismiss himself if he deems it useful.I can't find it really useful to use an extreme tactic like that of the burned earth.Finally, there remains the question of civil servants.I do not totally agree with Mr. Haarder, in fact.I share the opinion that the passage concerning civil servants is absolutely insufficient.This because, firstly, the accent was not put on the importance of a public service in general and, secondly, because there are all kinds of proposals which must be asked if they are judicious and if they will bring any improvement.	fr
The community can intervene in order to put local actors in contact so that they cannot, in fact, reinvent the wheel each in their region.We have an important role to play in the community, in the European Union, in this regard.SAVE is the only community program aimed at promoting rational energy use.It focuses on non -technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure;And the objective of this program is to create an environment promoting investments and energy efficiency.We must also realize here that there is a niche in the industry for energy savings.We have heard a lot about competition problems with regard to renewable energies, but energy efficiency makes it possible to save financial savings at business level, it allows financial savings everywhere and therefore, it should not create problems.We can all support this principle.I must say that, as for maternity, although we offer them our support, we sometimes do very little substantially and concretely to help mothers or people involved in energy savings.We could make much more given the major commitments we have made to reduce CO2 and greenhouse gases and reduce dependence on energy imports.We do not undertake the kind of actions that our citizens want.We do not establish the connection so that citizens can in fact achieve something concrete, whether at home or at the office or within the industry, to support actions aimed at combating global climate change.If we could communicate this, it would be very interesting to do so.Once again, I would like to thank all the people who contributed to this conciliation process.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Ms. Ahern for her work as a rapporteur of this proposal, because she contributed, with the collaboration of other parliamentarians, to obtain a ultimately very reasonable result, even improving certain aspects of a proposal from the Commission and, of course, that the Council had accepted, at the very beginning, from a budgetary point of view.As Ms. Ahern said very well, both the budget of the Save program and that of the Altener program are more symbolic budgets, because the weight is supported by countries, the States of the Union, the regions, or even, in some cases, the municipalities.But in any case, it is not because its volume is relatively reduced that it no longer has the important symbolic value that the fact that there is a will in the whole of the community to support this kind of actions which contribute to what we actually take our commitments from Kyoto and, moreover, that we are reaching the diversification of our energy sources, the security of our supply and in the case of Save,Direct to less consumption, greater efficiency in the use of energy, thus helping to achieve the objectives set.In addition, concerning these programs, namely, the Save program, an increased efficiency and economy, and the Altener program, renewable energies, there is a very large technological challenge to be met, which from an economic point of view, can give rise to important possibilities for industry and also for the creation of employment in our countries and, therefore, throughout the Union.	fr
"In addition, the President of the Parliament has been a woman since the 1999 elections. Finally, I quote the conclusions of the Conference on the involvement of women and men organized by the Commission in April 1999. Equality for women and men is not a problem only for women, it is a challenge for our society as a whole!.(EN) Some progress has recently been achieved in increasing the number of women in decision -making bodies throughout the Union. In our own institution, 30 % of the elected representatives are now women, including the President of the European Parliament himself. In Finland, a woman has also been elected president. On average, there are a quarter of women in Member States' governments and slightly more than one -fifth in their parliaments. It is not yet satisfactory at all, especially because the quantities vary greatly between the Member States, and the Nordic countries have a much more diverse female representation in responsible tasks and decision -making bodies. This situation is more related to the attitude and respect for the quality and ability of women's contribution to society than to pre -defined quotas. My group is not positive about the general use of these quotas, as in the long run they can negatively affect and even weaken the purpose they seek to support. Nevertheless, we know that the experiences of all Member States are not the same, and the use of such means can be considered legitimate - a temporary remedy - to re -balancing female representation where women are heavily under -represented. We may have supported the resolution of women's position in decision -making, which was intended to remember the International Women's Day on March 8, which included a revision of ten liberal groups and alleviated in the same line as the approach described above..(FR) Women suffer from increasing inequality because they are victims of sexual discrimination that can be practiced openly (violence, rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence ...) but also more insidious. This oppression is based on a sexual and social division of labor, which values ​​men's work at the expense of women's work. Salary is unequal, the work of female workers is still considered to be a ""complementary"" work, and in general they cannot be as responsible as men. In addition, they carry most of the family responsibilities. Like men, women must be entitled to full -time work. There must be binding laws to promote equality in working life. States must develop public day care for young children. Finally, working hours must be significantly reduced so that all men and women can participate in public life. Political, economic and social life must be made really common. We oppose the idea that the biological difference between women and men generates two different worldviews and two different value systems. Women have the right to be represented in the decision -making process as ""individuals"" and not as representatives of the female gender..(No) I, along with my Conservative British delegation colleagues, is fully committed to having more women in a diverse and active role in public life. We are very sorry that inequalities and gender discrimination, and especially women's underdog, are still present in politics. However, we are not convinced that one type of discrimination should be responded to by a different kind of discrimination, namely using quotas to ensure that women become elected. I am particularly interested in this, as on Tuesday night, this week, my 27-year-old daughter Caroline was selected as the upcoming candidate for Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom. He achieved this position exclusively with his own merits in an open competition for all newcomers. We should not accept a position that in some way disparages the growing number of women who show how they without fear and favor can deserve their place in public life. As a result, the members of my delegation have largely supported the resolution, but we expressed our protest against positive discrimination against women, as we think it is the wrong way to promote this because it is in itself downplaying and distorting a democratic procedure. Therefore, we refrained from the final vote."	fi
"I tell you as an entrepreneur who is quite interested in it.But a system cannot work like that!It only works in the coupling.I give you an example: The European Union rightly promoted the Grönitz steel mill in Brandenburg, although only 700 of 5,000 jobs are left.However, these are competitive jobs, because this steel mill is now number 2 of the tool steel manufacturers in the Federal Republic of Germany.Anyone who now endangers the production of this steel mill by receiving the granted aid at the time not only endangers the steelworks itself, they endanger an employer in this region, which of course also depends on small and medium -sized companies.Of course, this cannot be a competitive policy of the European Union!If we want to have competition, we have to get this coupling between the economic necessities and the business requirements.This is also the only opportunity to build regional economic cycles in the underdeveloped regions via this path that leads to people being socially secured that purchasing power is strengthened.This means that we also have to take a decisive account of a demand -oriented economic policy than just the offer -oriented!Mr President, never before I was elected Parliament in 1994, I have met a report with such anti-Irish undertones as the report by Mr. Jonckheer, which we debate about today.I would like to quote from the report literally: ""The state aid per employee ... are in Italy, Germany ... and Ireland at the highest, but Ireland clearly comes first when the state and joint aid from the regional and social funds are viewed together."" I believe that the rapporteur simply juggles with the numbers here.I can hardly understand how he can include regional and social funds in this mathematical equation.I would like to remind my colleagues that the European Union has approved the new guidelines for regional aid for the period until after 2000.This was just an expansion of the political goals of completing the internal market in Europe.Regional differences must be overcome so that the internal market can develop successfully and thrive.I welcome it that after 2000 grants of 40 % and in the case of SMEs and their investment of investments, 15 % are also intended for companies that are located in target 1 regions.I remember Mr. Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland are at least separated from the continental European market by two larger seas.No other Member State is so disadvantaged.Mr President, my very worshiped ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues!The cartel ban is the core of a functioning competition order in Europe.The commission perceived the practical handling of monitoring the antitrust ban;This must also be agreed at first.But with regard to the solution, opinions differ.The commission's proposal does not differ formally from the cartel ban, but as a result, this proposal is a transition from a ban with a reservation of permission to permission with a ban on prohibition.This is the transition from the prohibition principle to abuse principle.Such a serious system change is decidedly rejected by me and other colleagues.I do not accept that an implementation problem in practice should be the reason for changing the legal system."	de
It is therefore also extremely important that this cumulative condition can be accepted.To finish, I will repeat that, in my opinion, our colleague Di Pietro has accomplished an excellent work by presenting a report which offers, within the limited framework of existing possibilities, all the guarantees of preserving individual rights and fundamental freedoms.However, if we want to provide a greater feeling of security to the European citizen, we must work even more on judicial cooperation.Mr. President, my group is delighted that one succeeds in an agreement aimed at regulating the daily practice of mutual aid in criminal matters.The aim of this regulation is to define mutual rights and duties between states or citizens or in the relationship between citizens and authorities.The proposal that is submitted to us is complex because, if it deals with agreements between the Member States, it nevertheless has deep consequences on the relationship between the citizen and the authorities.However, the council proposal is terribly insufficient in the field of legal protection.To use the terms of the rapporteur Di Pietro, the proposal even testifies to colossal deficiencies.The agreement allows requests for chain legal assistance which combine the procedures the authorities and the penal systems of other Member States.The way in which this is regulated leads to that no judge can control this entire chain.Additional measures are therefore necessary, such as the obligation made to judicial police officers to meet any request for testimony in a criminal case involving documents of their provenance.Another point that poses a problem for my group is that the proposal of the council crowds the principle of proportionality to the feet.In any case, no limitation of the scope is advanced.The agreement is therefore not only applicable to the fight against serious crimes and organized crime.Nowhere is it mentioned that it is limited to criminal law.It is therefore not unthinkable that the Union is soon fighting mosquitoes with cannons and that the rights of citizens go up in smoke.Mr. President, the Convention on Mut on Division in Criminal matters, which we examine today, contains the essential minimum for effective and rapid collaboration between the various judicial or investigation bodies.It concerns notifications, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of prisoners, the restitution of goods, testimonies by videoconference, survey activities and those called Undercover, telephone interceptions, etc.This is the minimum on which we can grant ourselves and I hasten to add that if certain amendments had to pass like, for example, amendments 32 and 81 or 70 or 71 reviewed, the whole agreement would be reduced to a simple exchange of notifications or information.Consequently, she should be thrown in the basket and we would vote against.I hope that the common sense of deputies from various groups will encourage them to reject these amendments.The fact that this question has not been the subject of a framework agreement and has remained at the level of conventions is a defeat for Parliament.	fr
In fact, the cost of accessing the Internet, the exclusion of the entire ethnic groups (young unemployed, housewives, the elderly), and shortcomings of education systems or vocational training are an information society that should be beneficial to everyone, shadowing assumptions. Another concern applies to people working in this field;Flexibility is characteristic of the sector and therefore employees must be able to benefit from organizational structures and guarantee of their rights, whether it is social security, pensions or work in adequate safety conditions. The third and final element applies to the issue of public service and the improvement of democratic systems to improve methods ... (President interrupted the speaker. Therefore, I congratulate the Portuguese of the Council on the decision of Portugal, this topic as the main theme of the Extraordinary Meeting of the European Council. I congratulate the Commission on its proposal and the report of the report on the report, and I would also like to say very clearly why I do this thanks and why I also want to rely on the words of all of you. The main content of the report and the first purpose of the Commission's proposal is that it is necessary to achieve equal opportunities for all citizens in the information society and equal participation. Eeurope initiative, so the text says, is primarily intended to show every citizen, the economy and the school, each company and every agency the road to the digital era and network. In my opinion, this objective does not justify the concern of the possible division of society for those who have these opportunities to use information and those who do not have them. I will emphasize this goal in particular because I believe it can make the interests of the European Union Information Society, but of course only if we also hold our word and fulfill our promises to citizens, if we promise and enable all schoolchildren by the endBy 2003, for citizens - all, whether they are poor or rich - are a wide and safe opportunity to use our health care systems. And if we also do in a timely manner that we need what we need to support our small and medium -sized businesses, namely, insurance for common risk capital in the community. This is the task of the Council, Parliament and the Commission. I wish all of us a lot of success in the name of citizens. Mr President, Member of the Commission, I congratulate the rapporteur for a successful work done in a short time. Any information society, which is involved, is probably the emphasis on a member of the Commission for this process. It's important, thank him for that. In Lisbon, the principles of sustainable financing for social security should be agreed because of this idea. You also need to have an agreement with the social partners, for example, teleworking and vocational training, in the case of all the information society involved. This is not what it is unless the fundamental rights of employees are safeguarded. The threat is that the Internet will make services into self -services, and this is a big issue of employment. Another thing: we have been dismantling the telecommunications regulation for about ten years, and now with large corporate subscriptions, there is a fear that these are starting to regulate the market again. This should be addressed. This is not to happen and I look forward to the Commission's sensitive ear and measures. Thirdly, the stock price of a web company recently rose four thousand percent per month, and this was done by giving unveiled stock exchange releases alone. So when many companies are similar or almost the same, much of the industry is bubble, and when the collapse occurs, I hope that taxpayers will not be paid for. Does a Member of the Commission have a medicine for what is being done at a time when these balloon companies in this field burst so that the taxpayer, for example, does not have to pay as a bank crisis?	fi
He admitted that 15 million Europeans are currently looking for work and that unemployment is the main reason for impoverishment and social exclusion. Portugal, Presidency, also considers the fight against unemployment to be an important priority. But these political priorities are often not reflected in the politics of the day. The Commission's decision to allow the implementation of the ABB starter fusion clearly demonstrates this. The new company has announced its intentions to implement a reorganization plan to achieve savings. This global reorganization plan could lead to a loss of up to 12,000 jobs. Particularly in my area in the UK, the merger has seriously influenced employment since the ABB starter reports that it will reduce Britain of 270 jobs, 95 of which are in Stafford and 112 rugies. Particularly worrying is that the company did not inform the Business Council of the merger plans. It is particularly important in the case of a large international company where decisions are made away from employees. Paragraph 17 of the Charter of the Community on the Social Rights of the Workers' Social Rights emphasizes the consultation of employees and that it applies, in particular, to companies operating in two or more Member States. In my opinion, this is not just a fundamental book. EU legislation could not be clearer. It would be best for the Commission to make its decisions in such situations not only on the basis of whether the merger distorts competition, but also based on the social and economic consequences it has. We should pursue a more extensive policy in such cases. We also need urgent urgent research on all cases in the assessment of the effects of mergers. This is the only way to comply with Article 127 of the Treaty. I consider the statement of the Commission member Liikanen, but I also hope to support Parliament that the legislation we have approved for workers' rights will be implemented effectively and that the employment effects of the proposed mergers are taken for granted. I have received a resolution submission for consideration in accordance with Article 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure. The debate has ended. The vote will be made later this evening. The session was suspended at 3:50 pm and continued at 4:05 pm. The discussion on important, current and urgent issues on the agenda is the discussion on current, urgent and particularly important problems. Racist and anti-alien incidents in Ejido (Spain) The following is a joint debate on the following resolutions: B5-0149/2000 Galeote Queedo and other PPE-de Group on racist and anti-alien events in Ejido (Spain);B5-0159/2000 Gasòliba I Böhm and Sánchez García Eldr on behalf of racist and anti-alien incidents in Ejido (Spain);B5-0162/2000 Díez González and others on behalf of the PSE group on the onset of racist and anti-alien incidents in Ejido (Almería);B5-0169/2000 Puerta and other GUE/NGL group on the racist and anti -alien incident in Ejido (Spain);B5-0175/2000 Bautista Ojeda and other Verts/Ale group from racist and anti -alien incidents. Mr President, this debate calms me down because I find that the first three of us are well aware of the situation because we are of African origin. First, I would like to congratulate the parliamentary groups for the great consensus we reached in this resolution, because I know how much we made as a member of the parliament to prevent such a question from using such a question. Secondly, I would also like to emphasize that Spain or Andalusia is not alien or racist areas, which of course does not exclude that the guilty of a single person or group would not be strongly condemned, as they are perpetrated by the law and only by law. We need to deal with the issue of migration in depth and carefully. Unfortunately, in this field, events that occur before political decisions will undoubtedly show how the primary importance is to develop Tampere Treaties and the IV Department of the Treaty. Current problems cannot be resolved within five years. That too is a long time, as we can see. The legislation of Member States must be adapted on the basis of agreements in Tampere, as stated precisely in paragraph 7 of the resolution.	fi
Diplomatic pressures are only effective when they rely on credible economic and military threats.The rest is only vux piles.Member States must therefore either allocate more money or get more involved in favor of modern mobile units so that our soldiers have to protect themselves from the best possible material;We will then rejoice decisions made last Monday in Sintra.The third heavy load that weighs on your shoulders is the guarantee of parliamentary control.Above all, it must be exercised at the level of the Member States.No soldier can be sent on a mission without the agreement of the national parliament.It is therefore wrong to speak of a European army.It is a force made up of national units.What is new is that it is fast, well prepared and that it has an effective common command and modern equipment.There is also naturally room for a certain right of gaze and control on the part of our parliament.You are often our guest, whether in plenary or foreign affairs committee, human rights, common security and defense policy, and we consider you someone capable of speaking and listening.I wish to finish rejoice with you the incredible unit of thought and the speed at which this new cooperation is set up.Some of us met the Portuguese Minister of Defense yesterday.He was as delighted and positively surprised as you are to note that we could agree on so many things.Remember that there are also non-aligned countries around the table.We share your joy as soon as we do not go too fast to the point of creating a breach in transatlantic cooperation.This is something that I would like to emphasize again, and I will finally insist on the fact that the objective of all this is to become so credible that, when we exert economic and military pressures, military intervention never takes place.This is the aim of all this, and it is therefore also important that you worked in collaboration with Mr. Patten, because it is the military, economic and diplomatic pressures which, in the community, will put a barrier for the encroachments in the surrounding territories.Mr. President, Mr. Solana, we are all big children.You make plans on the comet and in your road plan until 2003 there are 60,000 soldiers.It's extraordinary what in Sintra we decided to do in 2004, 2005, 2006. But in the year 2000 for Kosovo?You spoke with Mr. Gil-Robles, I received an email from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pretina at the moment.He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina.He treated Roma, Albanians, Serbs, and that is an unfounded thing in Kosovo.He was murdered, he has three children.We need police officers today in Kosovo!We need soldiers who do not apply a doctrine.	fr
What we need is better internal control and more termination options.We have to change the staff statute and the disciplinary procedures and, last but not least, practice.Article 52 of the HR statute on dismissal due to serious omissions is currently hardly used.We should rather tidy up and sweep in front of our own door than to ask for the establishment of new great institutions.President, we all want to contribute to fighting fraud in Europe.However, the question arises as to what contribution the European Union makes?The answer is that we know terrifyingly little.The summit of Tampere was about fighting crime.Allegedly everyone was satisfied with it, but there were hardly any progress in the substance.European legal provisions for fighting fraud are not in force, because the Member States, which has already been pointed out, has already been pointed out, and the contract texts submitted do not ratify.So a lot has to happen there.But what has to be done?Two things, and Ms. Theato's report clearly and clearly shows this.First, the same sanctions must apply in all Member States of the European Union for European frauds.Standardization in this special area.Second, a European public prosecutor's office that has two tasks must be created: firstly, to help the national prosecutors to support European fraud, and secondly, the judicial surveillance of Europol and Olaf, because these two investigative offices can currently act without legal control.In front of the European public prosecutor we do not need to be frightened, everyone around me only see ghosts.She is really something positive.Just like Europol.Europol, the police cooperation, is not above the national police services, but serves the exchange of information between the police departments.This is exactly what a small restricted European public prosecutor has to do, only not at the stage of the investigation, but of law enforcement.The parliament is for that.The committee of independent experts as well.I appeal to the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to also commit to this measure.President, I want to concentrate on the problem of Corpus juris.I strongly support the findings made by Ms. Morgan.The Corpus juris was set up without any public debate or participation.A European public prosecutor's office committed to the continental European investigation principle with national law overarching Europe -wide decision -making powers would have a lasting impact on the traditional system in Ireland as well as in the United Kingdom.Member States have the right to information about the possibility of a uniform criminal code and a European public prosecutor.When such a plan was presented for the first time, it was said that the EU budget would be limited to cases of fraud.But when the Corpus juris was actually launched in San Sebastian in 1977 - by the way, in front of a selected audience of 140 lawyers and excluding the media - said the then president of the European Parliament, Gil -Robles Gil -Delgado, that this was only a preliminary stage and that it was intended to extend the EU's responsibility to all areas of crime.We need a public debate on this topic.Member States and the citizens in the Member States must be extensively informed.The question of a potential danger for the traditional legal system in Ireland and the United Kingdom must also be discussed.	de
Dear colleague, I take your explanation and the existence of this joint resolution.If the Presidium's departments confirm that it was submitted properly, it goes without saying that it is taken into account.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m.(The session is closed at 8:14 p.m.) Approval of the protocol of the previous meeting Mr. President, I just want to say that there was a terrorist attack in Madrid this morning.The explosion of a car bomb has died.It is simply about judging such terrorist actions on behalf of my parliamentary group.Thank you very much, Ms. Fraga.We have already heard of this unfortunate incident.Unfortunately, the Spanish society is once again haunted by murderous terrorism and find its words as they will understand, the President of the president, since this session takes place under Spanish chair.(The parliament approves the protocol.) Resumption of the session period I declare the session period of the European parliament to resume on Friday, January 21, 2000.Ms. President, allow me to remember that tomorrow the catastrophe of Monte Cermis will be for the second time.Two years ago, in Italy, in Cavalese, an American aircraft coming from the NATO base Aviano died during a low -flying flight - in which the flight height permitted for safety reasons - the cables of a cable car and tore over 20 European citizens to their death.Since then, the relatives of the victims, who have failed to consume the consolation of justice, have been at least an immediate financial compensation by the United States because the guilty pilot was not held responsible under criminal law.I therefore appeal to the Parliament President and the President of the Commission to work for immediate compensation from the US Authorities and thus help the victims' family members.Thank you very much, Ms. Angelilli, I take note of this.The agenda according to the agenda follows the work plan.At the request of various factions and, as a result of the President's conference just ended, I suggest that in accordance with Article 50 of our rules of procedure, I propose a one -half -hour debate about current, urgent and important questions about the reaction of the Union to the government negotiations in Austria.If you agree to the proposal, the incumbent council president, Mr. Seixas da Costa, and the President of the Commission, Mr. Romano Prodi, will open the pronunciation.Who would like to speak for this proposal?Mrs. President!I take the floor to support the decision of the President's decision, and take the opportunity to say in my own name and in the name of the Social Democratic Group in the way I publicly criticized the presidency in January that we consider the explanations submitted by the presidency to be appropriate;We share them in terms of content, time and form.Now, Ms. President, it is really difficult to find a pronunciation that better suits Article 50 of our rules of rules.This is an current, extraordinarily important and urgent debate.That is why we think that we have to change the agenda to accept that.(Applause) does someone want to speak against this proposal?	de
"However, on this is the willingness to accept the progress steps achieved and far from the original position of Parliament on the issue of Committee. Let's remember what it is. Parliament has formulated four basic reviews of the Committee system, as in force before the new decision of the Council which is completed by this organizing agreement. First, the whole system is unclear. There is no transparency when hundreds of committees meet with secret daily provisions and no one knows who takes part in them. Here, with the new system we agreed, a real step forward will take place. We are going to know who participates in each committee. We are going to know when they meet. We are going to have their daily arrangement. We are going to take the documents that are sent to them. The whole system will become more open and transparent - though it is still complicated. We therefore note at least one step progress. The second point of our criticism is that the system is very limited to the committee. In the European Union, we approve laws and expect the Commission to bring them into force. But we also have a system designed to prevent the Commission and we have difficulty this project - especially the so -called ""Contre -Filet"" system, in which the Council could prevent the Commission by a simple majority, even if the Council could not find an alternative to this measure. At this point there is also at least some progress. The Council will no longer prevent the implementation measures for unlimited time beyond the quarter, unless it has a special majority to do so, in other words, unless there is a serious reaction between the Member States represented in the Council. This is a more reasonable system and is also a step forward. But in terms of the other two points of our criticism we are not so pleased. The first concerns the system under which the Commission is being monitored, subject to detailed investigation, checking whether you will only, by a committee appointed by the Member States or the Council and not by parliament. The legislative authorities, the Council and the Parliament must be equal. We give the powers of application to the Commission, but only one body appointed by the Council or Member States can give the slogan and, by saying ""no"" to the Commission, to prevent the implementation measure. Parliament has no such power. The truth is that now in this new system we are beginning to acquire such power. We will receive all the implementation measures delivered to a committee at the same time with the Commission. We will be able to conduct research, discuss, ask questions. But we will have the right to formally refuel the Commission only if in our opinion it goes beyond the responsibilities we have given it with the legislation. In other words, we can question the measure as Ultra-vires, but not in its content. But in a democracy, parliament must be able to challenge the content. Not that we do this every week."	el
This is an open and strong way to proceed so that all European institutions and European residents can participate. This white book responds to the challenges of enlargement, and the expansion forces us to re -reflection on the activities of all our institutions, to rethink our own policies - all of our policies - and to consider above all what we need to continue at the Union level when there are 25 or 30 Member States at the level of individual Member States. However, expansion is not the only thing that forces us to think about these reflections: as I said a moment ago, the globalization of economics and politics forces us to do so. We need to control Europe more efficiently, be closer to the citizens, promote everyone's involvement, starting above all about a significant problem in women's participation. One of the most prominent differences in comparison between Europe and the United States recently is not so much work mobility or a problem of work -related capital, but rather women's involvement in the economy, which is quite different in the United States than in Europe. However, in this field, Europe has always been a pioneer: this is why we have to think in depth and openly, and all the institutions - the Commission, Parliament and the Council - must consider its own role and our own policies. Therefore, we will immediately work with this white book, although to complete the work, we have to wait for the results of the inter -governmental conference, and therefore cannot be presented before spring 2001. It does not become a philosophical book, but a concrete book with a lot of accurate suggestions. Me - Commission - We know very well that we have to completely reconsider our own activities, and for this reason we are going to do two things: we are committed, and we are already fully committed to internal reform and deeply considering our own policies. I have asked all members of the Commission to identify the functions that can be abandoned - and we require an even more detailed explanation. The Commission must determine what its key tasks, the ones it needs to focus on, and abandon the functions that are not relevant in order to release new resources and that its relationship with individual states, regions and local communities could be more correct and cooperated. So we release new resources, but in the end, I also get a moment - and I am afraid, and I want to say it here in front of the Parliament - when even these new resources are not already being released is enough to do our new tasks: I am now thinking about expanding, new legal and indoor issues, health care problems, environmental problems. On that day, then, when we have used all our resources as carefully as possible, I will not hesitate to come here to ask for new resources, but I am already saying that if we do not have the resources we need, we must refuse all new tasks, as the resources we use are not proportionate to our new tasks. With regard to internal reform, you know how strongly my Commission has committed to it since the first day of their work. I know quite well that you cannot achieve any political goals unless the Commission is renewed vigorously and completely from within, unless it becomes more effective unless it enhances its operations in all areas of operation, starting from the area where retention has been most dramatically accumulated in the past. Delivering help quickly when needed, saves lives;Delivering help too late may often be worse than not being given at all. When I talk about external help, I primarily think about the Balkan region where we have the job of the work done by officials in the area, which, given our organizational problems, has been really excellent.	fi
On the contrary: his draft must meet the legislation of the individual Member States in the field of criminal law.The intention of making a unanimous decision can lead to compromises that do not withstand this exam.A conscientious parliamentary control by the European Parliament, but above all through the national parliaments, is of great importance.Di Pietro's proposal to delete the current article 18, which includes listening to telephone calls, among other things, is understandable, but very rigorously.The wording of Article 18 is unclear: it limits the activities of the intelligence services, but obviously allows the monitoring of telecommunications traffic by a Member State on the territory of another Member State without its prior approval.In this way, the Member States would make themselves largely vulnerable, and it is doubtful whether there are sufficient guarantees that both the state in which surveillance is carried out and its citizens are protected.Additional proposals, such as repeated references to the European Convention on Human Rights, the rights of defense and the suspect as well as the failure of the Member States in the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights, excessively inflate the text of the Convention.I see the problem, but I think that this could have been clarified with a single text change.Despite certain concerns, the Dutch members of the EDD parliamentary group will not deny the Di Pietro report in the vote.President, Lord, ladies and gentlemen!We have a report here, which is of the greatest importance not only because of its content, but also because it is a first step towards creating more smooth relationships in the field of judicial cooperation.It took place exclusively at the level of intergovernmental relationships, and the European citizen was unable to perceive any concrete signs of the Union Citizenship, which was repeatedly conjured up.On the one hand, judicial measures have nothing to do with the community dimension, on the other hand, we are already experiencing a level of freedom of movement for passenger transport, from which the criminals also benefit.According to Article 29 of the contract, it is now the aim of the Union to offer the citizens a high level of security in a space of freedom, security and right by developing a common procedure for the Member States in the field of police and justitial cooperation in criminal matters and fighting and fighting racism and xenophobia.It must be emphasized that the creation of Europol is already one step forward, but now the next step has to follow, namely the reinforcement of the judicial cooperation in criminal matters, so to gradually erect a real European legal area in accordance with the goal of creating a space of freedom, security and right.This draft is therefore the concern to complete the conventional instruments already available in other legal areas and to facilitate their application in the Member States in order to improve the judicial cooperation in criminal matters through an equally rapid and effective legal assistance, but to respect the essential guarantees of the rights of defense and the general principles in the field of human rights, which in the right of the Member States and in the rightEuropean Convention on Human Rights.This reservation in the essential rights, freedoms and guarantees has caused us to support the withdrawal of the proposed text in relation to telephone monitoring, whereby the Council recommends that the Council provide an independent legal instrument that can remedy this.	de
Herring Council President, I completely agree with them.The problem is not Mr. Kouchner, but the legal basis for his work, i.e. the resolution 1244. Apart from that, I mean that the responsibility of the Union and thus, but also our responsibility, is to overcome the provisional character of Resolution 1244 and to develop a future perspective for the entire region.In my opinion, the lack of a fixed perspective provokes or favors the riots, accidents and murders, of which Mr. Alavanos spoke.Does the Council intend to ask the question of the final status of Kosovo?And if so, does he intend to do this in connection with a general reorganization of the region by preventing the creation of numerous small -scale states as possible as possible, as is the aim of some, and by bringing together the individual parts, in this case Kosovo and Albania?Since the questioner is not present, request No. 7 is obsolete.Inquiry No. 8 of (H-0796/99): Concerns: New Interreg initiative in point 1 of Appendix 2 of your design of an interreg Interreg entitled 'Promotion of the urban, rural and coastal rooms' allows the Commission to renovate and further develop historical city nuclei by way of cross-border strategy.However, residential buildings are excluded.In view of the fact that there are numerous houses in rural areas that are of historical interest, including very small buildings, as well as the need to do something against the rural exodus for various reasons and to make rural areas more attractive, the advice is not of the opinion that these goals could also be supported by also supporting projects of housing construction in the areas recorded by Interreg?President!The council, and I would even say the Portuguese presidency, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems you, Mr. MP, pointed out in your question, and I would like to explain that we have always paid great attention to the community policies for the development of rural areas.I would like to refer to the new aid regulation accepted in May 1999 for rural development, which forms the community framework for the promotion of the sustainable development of rural areas, and this was known to be the developments that took place in the course of the negotiations on Agenda 2000 and the treatment of agricultural issues at community level.Through the European orientation and guarantee fund for agriculture, the EAGFL, the concern is behind this community funding concept to reverse the tendency of the desolation of rural areas, to which they, Mr., rightly refer to your question.On the other hand, the European Fund for Regional Development, the ERDR, also contributes to the promotion of economic and social cohesion in its area of ​​responsibility by corrected the main regional imbalances and participates in the development and restructuring of rural areas.In this regard, it should be remembered that the ERRE also contributes to the promotion of sustainable development and also to create sustainable creation of jobs in rural areas.The entirety of this instrument of the community enables us to implement a development policy for rural areas, which today, in the rest, represents a development and funding line of common agricultural policy in one of its fields of action and regional policy.	de
In 1992 we had 9.2%unemployment, both in Euroland, namely 11 countries and Denmark. From 1992 to 1998 unemployment in Denmark fell to 5.1%. In Euroland rose to 10.9%. In Denmark we had a total growth of 20% in confrontation with 10% of Euroland. If the Danish government has done today what it did then it would be grossly illegal and in conflict with the circumstances, because the budget deficit was 3.9%. Now in Denmark the budget is surplus, because those who now receive a salary have now begun to pay taxes instead of being provided with unemployment benefits. I think the prime ministers should study the Danish example when they meet for their financial chat in Lisbon. Instead of a new collection of fine words for the unemployed there is a need to modify the EMU Treaty. My team hopes that the Danish voters will decide to maintain the Danish crown when they are invited to vote in the referendum on EMU on September 28th this year. Mr. President of the European Council, I had the opportunity to hear with great interest the reason you have addressed us and it is clear that, in general, none of the present can help but agree with your words. These are statements of intentions that correspond to a view on employment and Europe problems that we all share. And in this respect there is what the main president of the Council described as one of the goals of the Lisbon Summit, the fight against the political deficit in Europe. And precisely because I believe that if we continue to make only general statements of this type, then we will hardly overcome this political deficit, I would like to ask you some specific questions to try to understand what this policy is to be implemented, under your presidency, after the summit. And the first question I would like to ask, and which is very immediate, concerns an institutional issue that for the first time we have the opportunity to discuss with the President of the Council of the European Union. It has to do with the most serious political problem we have been facing lately, the Austrian problem. And the question I would very much like to ask is: Does the Council of the Council of the Council of the European Union represent 14 or 15 countries of the Union here? And it is important to ask this question if, in the capacity of the President of the European Union, it operated and acted as a representative of bilateral decisions between Member States. And in this respect, this question has a great meaning and requires a very clear answer. I believe that it is very serious, in a institutional point of view, to head to the replacement of collective decisions, which the treaty imposes on the European Union, with bilateral decisions between governments. I am not referring to the essence of Austria's problem, but to the serious precedent that can be created if the collective decisions imposed by the Treaty by bilateral decisions, which are today against one Member State, may be replaced, tomorrow maybe against another or other Member States.	el
As for the lever, you have described all its mechanisms in your proposal, which is inspiring and exciting in many ways. The support point remains. Support point means means. However, you are here in a parliament that is still in the minds of many members that I would call the White Bar Syndrome, a magnificent initiative by Jacques Delors that crushed into the hands of the Ecofin Council. We do not want you to have a similar accident now, because the project you offer to us is so inspiring that it can give Europe to clean up and the future that our colleague Goebbels appealed. However, you will still need ways to implement your project that I am currently afraid of a little missing from you. So you have to come up with them. The forced shirt formed by Agenda 2000 will not give you the means needed. So you have to put pressure on your colleagues to act so that you get funding for your proposal you are going to give us. One example among others and this is one of the important suggestions you make is an example of the information society and the society of knowledge and skills. It is clear that social fracture is an essential problem that we have to fight and you explain this well. You should not add a thing that I would call digital fracture. To whom are you going to suggest this information society and a society of knowledge and skills? You suggest it to a population that is becoming increasingly aging, for a population that is still poor, and for the population, which is unfortunately increasingly educated. So you have to act from the foundation of society if you do not want this society of knowledge and skills to be limited to the race for a few effective and essential SMEs. However, this is not your goal. The proposals you make are missing public services, which I apologize. Public services have been essential in the history of the European social model. It is true that it is no longer the time for monopolies and that the Commission has launched the process of liberating and competing in some public sectors to modernize and enhance them. However, this is not enough. Now, in the context of competition and information society, it is now better to define what the most important tasks of public services in the future are that public companies in this industry and also in private companies are appropriate. In this respect, there would be stronger initiatives that are not yet included in the Commission's work program, but which you could give the impetus: I think it would be an extremely important sign. In the end, I say that this society of knowledge and skills is based on research and development, and I would like to recognize this to the Commission's initiative to create a European research area. However, the Mr President, the Commission and the Parliament need a council in this regard to give the necessary means for the establishment of this European research area. The framework program is not enough, but it must be provided with power and its main guidelines must be changed. This is a significant job, but we trust you. Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, good colleagues;Mr President, you talked about a political deficit. Proposals that are made in Lisbon and are to bring together the famous general guidelines for economic policy and employment guidelines for the development of European growth and employment policy guidelines are in the right direction. They are a tool for political decision -making. However, they include decisions related to the institutions, the significance of which we understand in the medium term. They strengthen the European Council in the decision-making process. The proposals are not impartial in this respect. Let us evaluate the impact of all the decisions we make when we need to discuss the reform of the Council of Public matters. And behind this European -level decision -making process is the second battle that each of us has to go to its Member State, as it is of no use in the political level to decide on fine guidelines, if the budget discussions we take to our Member States are not taken into account.	fi
This infectious anemia of the salmon is caused by an Orthomixomicrovirus that decomposes the blood of the salmon and thus causes his death.The disease spreads slightly through mucilage in salt water, etc.The 1993 guideline allows not only to remove the diseased fish, but but also all fish of an affected farm, as in the case of a cow in a herd you slaughter the entire herd for precautionary reasons.Now we are proposed a loosening of this guideline in such a way that not the entire inventory is eliminated, but only the fish reported as sick.As for the other fish, you would have time to wait for what is happening depending on the local circumstances.I think that is an extremely dangerous approach.I would like to draw your attention to this, because you cannot be satisfied with the statement that the temperature limit of 27 ºC is sufficiently protected and consequently there is no danger.But does that also apply to women?There are still no studies in this regard in the human tissue.In addition, there is also a risk to the environment, because as is well known, there is an incubation period in salmon, and consequently, if they are consumed, they can transmit this virus without being ill and therefore a danger.Another danger to the environment is that this disease is transferred to wild fish as we have seen.For this reason, together with my colleague Patricia McKenna, we brought amendments to the proposals submitted by the Commission.Mr. Piétrasanta has explained why we support some aspects of the Commission's proposal, especially in terms of the development of a vaccine and the compensation of fish breeders that are forced to remove their fish.The idea of ​​changing the emission policy does not make us very happy.Now it has been found that Norway has done better work in combating ISA epidemic and that we will achieve a standard as high as Norway with the proposed changes, but it must be said that there is more than just a difference between the Norwegian politics and the politics of the community.This is a measure of the community, which also applies to Ireland, where I come from, should occur similarly unfortunate circumstances.There are further differences, and this affects the procedure in relation to inspections of affected companies, the dismissal periods, restrictions for the transfer of contaminated fish and contaminated material, etc.Before we pre -copy the Norwegians, we should try whether we cannot contain the catastrophe with these other means.A lot has been talked about the BSE in the past.For years, the Greens have pushed to deal with the problem with the problem.If you had done this at the time, many farmers and the EU could have saved a lot of money.This also has to do with environmental protection, with the protection of farmers themselves and with the protection of public health.I would like to thank Mr. Hudghton for his excellent report on the infectious anemia of salmon and his general support for the measures proposed by the Commission.I also thank all of my previous speakers for your contribution this evening.	de
The first is that of the harmonization of national regional planning policies and regional development policies.Subsidies are not enough to make development, when infrastructure or public services are lacking.It is therefore a substantive question that we must ask ourselves: how can we make sure that the Union policy is articulated with the national subsidiary policies of regional planning.The second challenge is that of enlargement, which will naturally have considerable consequences both in budgetary terms and geographic terms.These are two sites that I invite the commissioner to work and which I ask him to associate us.Finally, during this period of natural disasters, I would still like to mention the question of the employment of structural funds.We know that it is up to each of the states to redistribute part of the envelopes.It should not be, as states want to want, that Europe disappears completely.Today, public opinion, the press, accuse us of being absent subscribers while we are going to finance a large part of national efforts.I think we have to be able to say it loud and clear.I think that we would also have to establish or ask the Member States that they provide information on European aid, whenever they are mobilized to repair the damage caused by natural disasters or accidents.Mr. President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria strengthens the rise in inequalities in all forms.For experts in the French plan, for example, the most likely scenario is today a digging of regional differentiations within each country.However, the structural funds have helped brake this process.Our project of a Europe turned towards the satisfaction of social needs aims for convergence by the top of the conditions of existence.Its implementation would certainly imply an extension of redistribution instruments such as structural funds.We offer in particular a unified capital tax, which would supply funds used to support the harmonization of social protection systems and the reduction of working time at European level.However, the commission, required to present orientations, does it only with regret and vaguely.The report proposed today restores its place to politics.It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development.This is what will lead us to vote it.Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work.I think that in the coming years, in front of the challenge of globalization and enlargement in the East, Europe will be more than ever the need for adequate and precise orientations as to the programming and the revival of its economy.Consequently, Europe as a whole, and each of the Member States in particular, will have to make the most of all its resources and its capacities, and therefore also the structural funds available.To do this, a European Commission is needed which, beyond its good intentions, clarifies its guidelines and engages maximum in control of the use of these resources by the Member States.	fr
I am in favor of this proposal. But this can never replace the help that is worth giving the media in Yugoslavia, Serbia. The European Union makes a distinction. In the past, he made a distinction about help and should be able to do the same in the future. It is good that this is done in the framework of the new CARA program, but it should be done in two weeks with the stability pact. At the Conference on Funding of the Stability Pact, the European Union may have to set some programs. The programs exist, there is a need. So let's make sure that we soon take action. Mr President, no matter how one looks at the Balkans, from the recent horrible past or to the future, in relation to the Stability Pact, he will not cease to confront Milosevic's face and his gang, persons responsible for rows of crimes against Humanity. Due to the monopoly position they hold on the radio and television, and because of the oppression of any independent alternative criticism, this old man, this old communist of the old man, can and remains in power. The European Union is trying to do some things, such as supplying equipment to independent stations. But now that they are closing these stations one after another, the European Union should begin new consultations with those affected. Not long ago we heard that they refused to give a visa to Mr Wiersma, who wished to visit the opposition in Belgrade. The strange thing is that today's European Union does not seem to realize that we have this medium at our disposal and that this means that, for example, we could deny entry into the hooligans of Serbian football, because they are people who benefit from the most cynical manner. Now that the stability pact will begin to play a role, one of the new opportunities offered is to provide assistance to the surrounding countries, especially after political changes in Croatia. Creation of alternative news stations in Croatia and Montenegro is an immediate possibility offered. However, in order to achieve the stability pact, Serbia must turn into a democratic rule of law and the responsible criminals are referred to the Hague court. As long as Milosevic and his own can adopt laws that violate classical human rights and freedoms, as far as this is the case, the prospects for Serbia will be adverse. It is a shame that the internal opposition is so weak and so divided along nationalist lines. The European Union should seek forces in Serbia that are not governed by this short -sighted nationalism, but by values ​​that are also judged in the European Union positive for humanity. Mr President, we will warmly support our compromise resolution, especially since the Confederate team of the European Union Left - Left of the Greens of the Northern Countries withdrew its support.	el
We ask that this possibility makes significant changes to our life in society, that democracy is also synonymous with equality between men and women, that the latter are not excluded economically or socially, as is the case today.That values ​​dear to women, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security, environmental protection predominantly guide life in the European Union and, if possible, in the world.To do this, women must be given the opportunity to intervene against the inertia of a society essentially imbued so far with male values.Our experience teaches us that freedom and decision -making capacity do not go, they conquer.Let us continue this conquest and that this new century brings us victory, not on men, nor on anyone: the victory of equality between men and women.We can no longer afford to lose a single opportunity.The great challenge now posed to all Europeans in general, and women in particular, concerns the new economy and new technologies in the information sector.The Lisbon summit, which will be held at the end of the month, particularly concerns women.The employment rate in Europe must be increased, significantly lower than that of the United States and Japan.To do this, you have to put many more women at work and work in new jobs, for which the European Union is in deficit.I therefore ask the Council and the Commission What proposals they intend to present at the next Lisbon summit so that the new economy and the new Europe that we want to build definitively integrates equality between men and women?Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, I was delighted with your intervention because you dared to quote the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, namely Finland, France and Sweden, but also because you have not failed to mention the states where things are going less well, which is the case for my own country in particular and of Greece, country that you forgot to appoint.I have also heard that very few women may appear on the lists in the next elections that will take place in Greece.I believe it is very serious.I appreciated your intervention because I find that it is high time that we had in the European institutions of concrete means to improve the place of women in politics.This is why I think it is essential that this Parliament continues to insist on quotas and that it appears openly in resolution.I myself am, Madam Commissioner, a quota product and I do not believe that a single member of this assembly is able to demonstrate that I am less competent.In some of our European countries, it seems that meritocracy remains such a masculine principle that women have no chance.	fr
"Between 1998 and 1999, the loyalists attacked and killed 123 people, against 93 for the Republicans.In 1999, 193 cases of legal proceedings are noted against loyalists and 97 against Republicans in 1999.Since January 1, 2000, there have been six assassinations perpetrated by loyalists, against two by Republicans;The loyalists participated in six serious shootings, one of which left one dead, and the Republicans with five shootings.Mr. President, this situation cannot continue and we must remedy it.Mr. President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has defined an important objective for the Union.A task that all deputies, the Council and the Commission must assume during this legislature: creation, as has already been said, of a space of freedom, security and justice.The Tampere, engine and craftsman's advice of this objective has proposed a few goals, but the five -year period planned for the development of Chapter IV of the Treaty is too long for the urgent solutions that certain problems require.My first reflection is that the Parliament should not remain on the sidelines of the important decisions which will be taken in this area and that it is necessary to guarantee its participation in the decision -making process, especially with regard to a citizens' project, as the Commissioner said.My second reflection is that it is necessary to advance quickly in the adoption of a common asylum system.We must approve common procedural standards and, above all, put an end to the current confusion between immigration for political causes and that motivated by economic reasons.The latest laws on foreigners, adopted in my country, Spain, or in Belgium, are a warning and demonstrate that the communitarization of immigration policy must be adopted as quickly as possible.My third reflection concerns the external action of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum.We must neither give the impression that the union only wants to defend himself against an avalanche of refugees and economic immigrants.We must bet on a development cooperation policy with the neighboring countries of the East and the Mediterranean area, but with rigor, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which cooperate for the protection of citizens who see their most fundamental rights violated or who wish to emigrate in order to deal with their most basic needs.Finally, with regard to the charter of fundamental rights, European citizens need to visualize their citizenship.Euro, employment or even security are not enough for them.They need the ""European soul"" as an illustrious Spanish teacher said.Mr. President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I would like to come back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr. Vitorino.As Mr. Ceyhun said, the words of this trio resounded like music in our ears.As well as of all music, it must offer a pretty melody and be well orchestrated.Many of us here to consider with great optimism the next six months."	fr
This is particularly clear in France: in the Champagne-Aldennes region, which I represent, the BSP sank from 105 to 94 %of the community average, in the Pays-D-Loire region from 95 to 91 %, in Auvergne from 89 to 83 %.The Rhône-Alpes region and Alsace are also not excluded from this general trend.It is also confirmed in Sweden and Finland, where unemployment has increased to a scary in recent years, as well as in several regions of the United Kingdom.In view of this, it may be surprising that the goal 2, which is intended for the industrial and rural regions in economic restructuring, was sacrificed in connection with the structural fund reform in favor of targets 1 and 3: In the period 1999-2006, 22.5 billion ECU is available, i.e. about just as much as in the period 1994-1999.The areas that are eligible according to goal 5b must bring the greatest victims in this regard: in France, 27 % of the population, which is eligible for the structural funds, will lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period, whereby this percentage in some regions such as Pays de la Loire, Alsace or Basse-Normandy, the voters that are disadvantaged by the party-political benefice economy of the left-wing governmentlies.On such a basis, it is extremely doubtful whether regional policy can contribute to a balanced design of the territories of the Member States of the European Union.Vogau report (A5-0069/1999) In view of the employment situation in the community and the ambition to combat unemployment by the European Union, the analysis of corporate concentrations created by the Commission should also take into account other factors than just competition.As an example, I would like to name the restructuring of the company ABB-Alsthom Power, from which a larger delegation of employees from all over Europe is present here in Strasbourg today.The directorate of ABB-Alsthom Power, which emerged from a merger in June 1999, has announced a restructuring that will lead to the cancellation of jobs in some countries.This fateful job situation raises numerous questions, in particular with regard to the information that has been given to the European works council that has existed since 1996.This means that the Community Directive must be updated and strengthened via the European works councils.This also includes control of the company mergers taking into account the workplace situation, the environment and the consumer.The report of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Currency was inadequate in this regard, so I found my voice..(Pt) The Commission wants to apply the principle of subsidiarity in the area of ​​community competition policy, and therefore it decentralizes the decision -making authority regarding the abuse of marketing positions by agreements between companies that lead to market distortions by transferring it to the national authorities and dishes, but questions in connection with company compilations and state subsidies fall under the registration system.The now point of view is based on the creation of forms of competitive policy to be used faster and cheaper, whereby communal law is to be applied at the level of the national courts and not at the European Court of Justice and is even referred to specialized courts.This partial renationalization of competition policy can be associated with higher costs for the Member States.On the other hand, and the rapporteur is reminiscent of this, on behalf of the competition policy, state monopolies were often replaced by private monopolies by privatizing important sectors and companies in the public sector, as has been done in Portugal with negative effects for the country and workers.	de
In order to respond, the Commission has made several commitments and has undoubtedly adopted many reform measures.It should be recognized that the new president, Mr. Prodi, and his team are really engaged in the implementation of the financial control requirements that Parliament has established.Nevertheless, it is now necessary to include the reform of the European Commission within the framework of the debate which will take place during the preparatory period of the intergovernmental conference which will soon be held and the reform of different policies and initiatives of the EU.The current treaties of the European Union will be amended so that, for example, enlargement is a success.I am sure that we will analyze the next reforms of community institutions during this debate.But for small Member States, it is important that the reforms of the European Commission which will take place does not compromise the representation of small Member States within the Commission.Mr. President, the Commission requests the granting of the discharge for 1997, but, in reality, it does not deserve it.The 1997 financial year is a matter of the old commission;This is why the new commission considers that it has no responsibility to assume.It is correct to say that the execution of the budget for 1997 was of the old commission, but the new commission, on the other hand, has committed to putting order after the scandals and I must admit that I am really not impressed by what it has done so far.The old mentality consisting in hiding things and supporting his friends is unfortunately always present.Some people claim that we would make it better to pass the old faults in oblivion and to restart more beautifully, but I do not think that we can restart even more if we have not previously settled things.I am especially thinking here of recent scandals that affected the Echo program.I am absolutely offended to note the difficulty of obtaining documents relating to this case.I am a rapporteur for the Echo program within the budget control commission and I am difficult to do my work from the moment the commission refuses to give me the information I need.Seen from the outside, it feels like the commission has things to hide.My investigations unfortunately also tend to show that this could be the case.The commission does not put everything on the table and it repeats its ancestral practices.These are such practices that have been fatal at the old commission.I therefore approve, in all respects, the request to give the assembly unconditional access to administrative documents, failing which we cannot do our work.Thank you very much, Madam Commissioner Schreyer!The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Follow-up to be given to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts The agenda calls for the report (A5-0001/2000) of Mr. Van Hulten, on behalf of the Budget Control Commission, on the follow-up to be given to the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on the Reformation of the Commission.	fr
In individual passages of the commission proposals, perhaps exaggerated caution perhaps have been carried out, for example with the demand to leave the detainees to the detained defendant as to whether he would agree to a temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for investigative purposes.I personally think it is unacceptable that, for example, Mr. Pinochet can decide whether he is transferred to Spain for a comparison or not.Or with the claim to put a defender aside the witness or expert - and not only to the accused, the accused.But these are minor defects that are hopefully removed by the vote of this high house.The rapporteur has shown a commendable commitment what needs to be recognized and for what I thank him for.The result is noteworthy overall and hopefully will be fully taken into account by the Council.As already mentioned, a question that the most delicate is still unresolved is: it affects Article 18 of the Convention, and therefore the direct monitoring of telecommunications traffic by another Member State, without the latter, in which surveillance is carried out, for help, which is possible today thanks to modern technologies.The topic is very controversial because there is a possible source for misuse.One could say that the proposed regulation is better than nothing overall, but it still appeared to the committee inadequate and not safe enough.It is therefore worth further considerations that in times when the contradictory reports about Echelon awake the ghost of the big brother, presumably more detailed about the instruments and methods with which on the one hand protects personal rights and on the other hand an effective but at the same time can be enabled to be meticulously and at the same time.The goal is to establish if possible, albeit sensitive, balance between the effectiveness of the fight against crime and the maintenance of freedom and dignity: a goal that is not only pursued by the individual states, but also with the politics of the Union, the endeavor of which is to become a space of freedom, security and right.This goal is still a long way off, but it can be achieved in individual steps.The most important step will be the harmonization of the right of the Member States, but for today we want to be satisfied with this little step because it goes in the right direction.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanations.They show some serious mistakes in this suggestion.The lack of linguistic clarity will inevitably lead to legal uncertainty.However, legal certainty is something that is absolutely necessary in such decisive questions.Due to the sloppy drafting, the convention can be interpreted very far, and it ignores the strict conditions that must apply to surveillance according to the European Convention on Human Rights.Article 18 allows surveillance in another Member State without its inclusion.Not only should that be deleted, but throw out the entire surveillance title at all.In an initiative of the FBI, the user requirements are compiled, which form the basis of current legislation.The Council proposal, which contains these requirements, Enfopol 98, was accepted by this parliament in the Schmid report last May.	de
The date will be determined as soon as this regulation is approved. Finally, I would like to reiterate that I am convinced that the LIFE program will become an effective tool that will support the development and implementation of the community's environmental policy. Parliament has greatly contributed to the improvement of this instrument. I am convinced that you share my desire to adopt the regulation as soon as possible, especially, given that in Member States as in other countries, in addition to the candidates, which are now given the opportunity to participate in the LIFE program, there are high expectations. Thank you, Mrs. Wallstrfm. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30. Modernization of Social Protection The agenda provides for the discussion of the report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's announcement of a coordinated strategy for the modernization of social protection (COM (1999) 347-0251999/2182 (COS))., rapporteur.(Sv) Mr President, the issue of social protection systems is important and is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU. The basis is monetary cooperation, followed by a macroeconomic cooperation and cooperation in the field of employment policy. It is a natural consequence to continue now with social protection systems. These areas are interconnected. Economic stability is the basis of growth and can lead to increased employment and also enables prosperity. But the opposite is true: a highly developed policy in social protection can help increase employment and development. In other words, social protection is a productive parameter. There are differences in the EU in terms of social protection systems. Many of them have their roots in historical factors. But in front of us is a series of common challenges. B. C. Demographic evolution not only increasing the number of elderly, but also to reduce births. The job market also changes. Women are turning to the labor market to a greater extent. Another challenge is technological evolution. We have to face these challenges together. The Commission's announcement is to increase the exchange of experiences, as well as the creation of a high -ranking team and the application of benchmarking. In addition, an annual social protection report will be issued and will be examined jointly with the employment report. That's good, but it's not enough. We recommend a process similar to that of Luxembourg. Clear guidelines and indicators are required, while Member States will form the methods of national action plans. We create a common model, but we maintain auxiliaryism. This social convergence is a process that will take place for a long time. For this reason, parliament must be actively involved in the work - not participating in the high -ranking team, but with the monitoring of its representatives of the high -ranking team and by submitting proposals for the implementation of the procedure.	el
In order to ensure the single awarding of justice and prevent different interpretations, the administration of justice must remain the subject of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg. With the quality of his 40 -year work he turned the 1950s Convention into a dynamic body that takes into account social, economic and moral developments in our society. The opinion of the Committee on Women's Rights shows what kind of contradictions and absurdities can lead various ideologically colored views. This committee requires e.g. The map of fundamental rights and a clause for the ban on discrimination in human sexual orientation, while arguing that family rights do not exist in itself. Care is needed to deal with well -intentioned, generous proposals if we are to prevent an paralysis in EU decision -making procedures from a plethora of appeals and not to inquire a situation where the European Court of Justice will be forced to overcome the number of judges and no one shouldfor the issuance of a decision. We welcome the work that is now starting to draw up a map of fundamental EU rights. Such a map is of great symbolic value and will enhance the confidence of Union citizens in the EU and European integration. The map of fundamental rights must be regarded as a supplement to the European Convention on Human Rights which, in our opinion, must be incorporated into the Treaty. The map will focus on relations between citizens and European institutions. Its primary goal will be to ensure the transparent governance of the Union. The map must be legally binding by introducing it to the Treaty. It should not be a mere declaration without any obligations on the EU institutions and the Member States. We would like to emphasize the principle of auxiliary and the fact that the map should focus on fundamental and civil rights and freedoms in accordance with the common constitutional traditions of the Member States. We would like to draw attention to the importance of the social dimension of EU action, but we believe that social policy as a whole is an issue that must be decided individually by each Member State., in writing.(FR) The map of fundamental rights is the latest incarnation of the editorial derogation of Community legislation. Indeed, such a text is only interesting if we see it as the possible preamble of a European Constitution; it would be unnecessary in the case of the Member States who have incorporated these rights into their Constitution and their legal traditions and confirm them with the ratification of international texts, such as the European Convention. We can always think of solutions to improve the implementation of existing texts, but the technocratic nature of the Community building continues to be imposed today, resorting to the processing of a complementary text that will hardly avoid its repetitive character.	el
The political crisis, which led earlier this year, has clearly shown that unambiguous and useful procedural rules are needed. Since then, various new practices have been introduced. The parliament must evaluate them and should be made legally binding. Community institutions should take an example of some Member States, in particular the United Kingdom, and create a committee of public life standards, which would give advice on the professional ethics and procedural rules of the Union's institutions. Persons reporting offenses who work in good faith must be protected. At the end of last year, a member of the Commission Kinnock announced the protection of persons reporting off the offenses. This should be started without delay. Although such actions can never be an option for good leadership, they are an emergency when something fails. It is absolutely important that the reforms are not limited to the Commission alone. Parliament itself must consider improving its internal rules, administrative procedures and leadership practices. Finally, the Commission's policy on human resources must be modernized. It is clear that it no longer meets the requirements of a modern multinational organization. Labor market matters have often acted as a brake on the reform, and the reform has been delayed for far too long. A career in community institutions must be made more attractive. Too many new officials leave their work after a few years. Merit must be recognized and rewarded. The development of specific skills must be a necessary condition for promotion. The reflection procedure must be made fairer and more open. Last but not least, pay and benefit packages must also be renewed. It must be made more flexible and such that it responds to labor market conditions. It has to take off some outdated parts, and it must take into account the legitimate concerns of the general public, as the public cannot understand why Union officials should be paid an abroad endless in Europe or why officials should often pay much lower taxes than in the Member States. Member of the Commission, Kinnock, will present the announcement of the reform tomorrow. This disclosure must include a clear schedule. As the new Commission and the new Parliament are now together and in action, the time for reform is better than ever before and probably a better moment will not continue. The Union will expand in the next few years. It is now time for Europe to get things done in its institutions and get involved in institutions like independent experts could have said a sense of responsibility. In June last year, European voters sent a clear message that they were tired of the endless things about bad administration and nepotism. There is a pretty simple way to deal with these things. We need to get rid of bad administration and nepotism..(IT) Mr President, I do not want me to be misunderstood in a sincere hope that it does not happen, and so I say at the outset that I will, of course, support the fight against fraud and support the vigorously proper and necessary reforms. It is a matter that is not simple and deserves a much wider handling, but I only raise a few things, and so, if we can, if possible, be aware of what we will discuss. All experts can provide information, news, statements and advice, but they have no political or responsibility, which is right. In my opinion, it is the politicians who have to investigate what can be removed from the report of the expert committee and which cannot be fully taken into account by an attitude that has in some situation influenced and still seems to me to be harmed by themselves. In my opinion, only a few factors only and only Parliament can take action for members of the Parliament, as the authority and representation of the European Parliament would be thoroughly endangered in the following years, and this institution would not develop as it should.	fi
". (IT) If the content of Article 158 of the Community Treaty is to promote the balanced development of the whole community, we must say that the narrowing of the differences is still far away, and in some cases, such as target 1 in Italy, regional differences in paradoxically even increase, particularly due to the existence of the existing structure. In spite of the changes made to legal regulations, the reduction of community procedures is actually still not done. If there is no administrative simplification, it is very difficult to achieve the goals set in the community in terms of efficiency and centralization. In this sense, there are shortcomings in the Commission document, as it does not provide any recommendations to the Member States to simplify national legal procedures and regulations, as well as the procedures applying and handling projects, as well as recommendations for funding, implementation and supervision. SMEs, small businesses and craftsmen in particular are still the ""weakest party"", as some Member States, among others. The legal and administrative regulations required by Italy, require a major obstacle to the aid of the Structural Funds. The very lack is that areas and other actors in no way can carry out their plans on time, which is why the Commission, which would have been to hear parliament in time for the Commission of the programming period 1997-1999, have actually resorted to an easy alibi to the Member States for an easy alibiThe newly elected Parliament had begun its legislative activities, and thus prevented the Parliament from influencing the nature of the existing instructions. For this reason, under Article 42 of the Regulation 122/99, the mid -term review is of no minor importance. In general, current instructions cannot be praised as clear or unambiguous. They only deal with the superficially important topic whether the development has been achieved in the measured proportion of the revised objectives and whether it is fully in line with the strategies presented in the community's policies. In addition, the preparation guidelines do not deal with sufficient effects of the expansion, as they do not include specific provisions or clarifications on the relevant regional or national authorities or even the applicant states. However, if the above is taken into account, one can be positively treated with a different approach to the preparation guidelines, where the goals are not regional but in line with the operating lines. However, if this, at least in theory, meets the requirements of centralization and at the same time the efficiency of the efficiency, however, the question arises as to whether the situation today in target 1 is such that it would actually allow the intervention policy that is needed to coordinate the budget. Thus, in theory, we can, in theory, to respond to the Commission's demand for the Member States, which would be established by the construction support centers that would arrange the implementation and management of the structural subsidies themselves, as long as such centers do not prove to be a supranational medium of concentration and as long as they are realized. I repeat again that these areas have not yet been able to benefit from the subsidies of the Structural Funds due to the combined effect of many factors. Thus, replacing regional objectives with lines of action could actually prove to be a negative effect. There are considerable restrictions on the instructions as the Commission, as they would, instead of defining guidelines, to determine guidelines, which, without the gradual definition of primary objectives, may even mislead the Member States by misdemeaning them. We could say that in fact, it happened again that the opportunity was to have a truly sustainable development in cities, which would also have restrained continuous urbanization and thus the destruction of valuable rural areas. The importance of the general support support was not sufficiently taken into account, although such support could prove to be very useful for achieving balance between urban and rural areas, and would also provide more opportunities for local actors who could decide independently and faster in local development, thus contributing to the efforts of the Structural Funds reform and to simplify the concentration of the Structural Funds."	fi
As the Parliament already stated in his first resolution on January 20, the needs of fishing, oyster cultivation and tourism sectors in particular suffering from the accident must be taken into account. That is why, at that time, we asked the Commission to take action for the fishing industry quickly by providing special funds for it. Galicia and Bretagne, the western locks of continental Europe, have also had to join forces due to this oil plate. Nor can we understand that the experiences of Urquiola or Amoco-Cadiz have not led to the enforcement of maritime transportation legislation in terms of both hazardous substances and convenience flags. We ask that this remains the last time. We ask that we all learn to learn and that we quickly change our legislation and block the loopholes that make us over and over again in these incredible and yet real situations. In our opinion, the principle of pollutant pay is not only necessary but also favorable. It is high time for polluters to start paying, as the victims and taxpayers of the accident have so far been paid for. They should not only pay but also clean the contaminated areas. I am therefore pleased with the Commission member of Fischler's reply, and in particular for admitting that it is necessary to take retroactive action and quickly respond to requests for help. I want my group, the socialist group, to express our solidarity for victims of the accident, fishermen, aquaticists and entrepreneurs, which allow the sea to properly bring its products to the market;Mayors and political decision -makers, as well as those who have participated in cleaning. I would say to all of them that we are familiar with solidarity with them. I want to ask two questions to the Commission member. Parliament has issued a resolution requiring the application of the pollutant to pay the principle in this case and to make both shipping companies and cargo owners responsible. The question for a member of the Commission is whether these principles can really be applied and whether we receive any money from these people through compensation. Another issue is the white book on the future and the Commission's environmental damage responsibility, which is intended to ensure that the pollutant pays principle will apply in the future and that we are better able to implement European environmental legislation properly. The White Book acknowledges that the liability of the damage can only be applied if pollutors are known if the damage is measurable and if the causal link can be demonstrated. Erika's case could not show the importance of the matter more clearly, as it combines everything that white book tries to show. This would therefore seem to be a really perfect way to deal with such problems in the future. The proposal for the Directive provides for severe liability for damage caused by the community -regulated dangerous functions, and my concern is whether the white book on environmental responsibility is able to treat different types of problems in the future or not. Perhaps a member of the Commission may take this. Do you really consider this concern, or will the pollutant in practice be able to pay for the damage he or she has caused, such as outpatient accidents. Mr President, we present our sympathy and the phrase of solidarity to the catastrophic people and areas. But good intentions are not enough, the damage must be paid and the losses must be compensated for both the restoration of the environment and for mussel planting and fishing equipment. We were in our mind when we heard a member of the Commission say that action must be taken and that the damage should be compensated quickly and retrospectively. We also criticize the inadequate control of ships and support the establishment of a European Coast Guard and, in particular, more binding regulation and dual soles. In addition, we criticize the comfort ticket system for both merchant ships and fishing vessels. Finally, when we heard, we were shocked that the cargo was very carcinogen because the number of polyaromatic hydrocarbons it contained was over a thousand particles per million. This means that when 15,000 tonnes of cargo were in the sea, 15 tons of it is a highly toxic substance. It is unacceptable, but we heard about it too late, and therefore we must ensure medical monitoring that focuses on the environmental volunteers that are very particularly addressed.	fi
Given the growing traffic on the streets of Europe, I would like to emphasize the need for the greatest possible technical safety of vehicles and respect for the environmental dimension. However, I would also like to put particular emphasis on this, it is also necessary in order for this directive not to remain a blank letter, to be implemented by the Member States and to be completed with the corresponding sanctions. Even the best directive will have no effect in practice if it does not provide for sanctions in cases of overlooking or breach. For this reason, I support the amendments that provide for the imposition of penalties on the culprits, because when vehicles are essentially a source of danger and results in potentially risk of people, those responsible should be prosecuted in the appropriate and specific way that requires the issue, but also with the necessary attention. A frivolous treatment must in any case be obstructed, especially because it is a directive that provides for provisions for heavy business vehicles that carry not only goods but also people. Every time a major accident occurs due to purely technical shortcomings we are all deeply crushed. In this respect I am happy that the report does not essentially face any objection, and that parliament is once again proven to be the driving force in the debate on security on the streets of Europe and traffic. A big thank you to all those who work with a dedication to this area, to the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee, to the Council and the Commission to the Committee of Honorable Mr. President, Honorable Commissioner De Palacio, the proposal of the Commission submitted in 1998 is aimed at replacing the Directive on the Annual Audit Directive. This proposal is proposed to introduce non -announced controls, as vehicles should be in good shape and in the interval between annual technical inspections. These non -announced checks can be made by roads, in the ports or in places where they are parked trucks. So it is about improving road safety in the EU territory, which is really important. The damage caused by trucks that lead to traffic accidents are often much greater, and the condition of the vehicles varies significantly in the various parts of Europe, so a pan -European legislation and its strict adherence is to the benefit of all those on the road. In the EU territory, there is a great deal of concern for the poorly maintained trucks coming from the Eastern Europe, which we must intervene strictly. Coming from Eastern Karelia myself, I know that if we added to them even the light to the second projector and half the brake wheels, this would already be positive. The joint position of the Council significantly improves road safety and the directive should have entered into force as soon as possible. However, in terms of the implementation of penalties, it is important to observe that the penalty should in no way be imposed on the Member State rather than the driver or businessman. Training is positive, but unfortunately only real penalties bring about hypocrites.	el
Mr President, in particular, I would like to thank the rapporteurs and the Committee on Basic Agreements, Rules and Institutions for ensuring that the European Union must join the Council of Europe's Convention on Human Rights. I hope that this position will remain in the plenary tomorrow as it will be essential if you want to avoid confusion between several different fundamental rights systems. I would like to highlight the strengthening of citizens' political rights through this book of fundamental rights. So far, I think less has been talked about. However, if we look at what a citizen today in the European Union can do, how he or she can influence decision -making, he or she does not have much chance. He can mainly participate in the election as a candidate and can vote in another EU country. But why not create some new institutions and instruments with this Charter that can really influence a citizen? Why, for example, would we not grab the idea that a certain number of citizens - let's say about three different EU countries - could take a citizens' initiative, which would then be channeled through the European Parliament? Why not see in the future that it is increasingly important for citizens to participate directly in decision -making? In my opinion, there would be a very natural dimension to the fundamental rights book, which has not been said very much so far. In the 20th century, Europe had to experience two terrible war and immeasurable tragedy, but at the same time we have been able to see how development has been opposed to civic, cultural and social issues. Working troops, by fighting for their rights, have achieved and strengthened results, and these results are crucial to the development of democracy. Therefore, it is amazing and unfortunately surprised that this document lacks a precise and clear reference to the social rights that are actually the most significant benefit of the extensive democracy process in Europe in the last century. I mean essentially important rights that without democracy would not be democracy, that is, without freedom of thought, saying, weight, and association, etc., which is based on democracy, but with the help of these fundamental rights and also allows both freedom and justice to be fully taken into account by the weight and substantive content. A precise and undeniable reference to the right to work must by no means be missing from such a document. It cannot be missing and must not be missing. Of course, social rights are mentioned in the proposal, but they must be expressed, they must be clarified and must be concrete: this applies to the right to work, health, education, home, pension, that is, the right to live in their lives in accordance with the principles of equal rights and equality. For this reason, I ask the European Parliament to approve my colleague Kaufmann and my couple of clear checks.- (pt) Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Member of the Commission, the only true basic issue in this Union Charter of Fundamental Rights is that, under the seemingly rewarding shell, it seeks to raise the foundations to the so -called constitution or even directly into the European State General Constitution. And that's why we oppose it. It is not about the content of the Charter. We come from a country whose constitution lists the widest fundamental rights of the world. And we belong to a party that has been tested in the battle for democracy and where uncompromising human rights has always been considered one of the most important things. But we are opposed to the Charter, because we think it is a kind of wooden horse for the Federation Trojan Troja, which, above all, hides other heavy political and legal consequences for Member States and European nations. At the moment, it is not right and, above all, it is not appropriate to undermine or break the balance of the establishment agreements.	fi
In my opinion, such parameters - in particular the quality -related, which result from investments in the areas of further training, vocational training, adaptation measures, retraining of older workers - due to their persistent effects on the medium -term effects - more important and mandatory than the mere formulation of always controversial annual quantitative objectives for the creation or reduction of jobs.If, among other things, as in the program of the Portuguese Council Presidency, the Commission could initiate a new phase of social dialogue, geared towards a coordinated strategy of socialization and knowledge spread, in short on a strategy of employment and determining their rules, this could lead to progress in the way to the participation of employees in the appropriate and mutually agreed management of the restructuring andRedesign processes can be achieved.Thirdly, I do not consider that the decline in the number of workers due to the aging of the population are by no means to be an inevitable fate of the European Union, not only because of the scope, which is offered by increasing women's employment and immigration, but because the widespread tendency must be decided to decide from the labor market by not considering the coordinated reform of social protection systems, for exampleReasons of future pensions, but to the active use of the higher life expectancy, is geared towards an extension of working life.President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen!You, Mr. Prodi, come very much and very ambitious.You and your ambition are welcome.It will be necessary in view of the huge task that you expect.But in order to carry out all of these reforms and also to advance the legislative program of 2001, you have to be very sure not only of your own powers as reformers, but also the opinions of the others.You say you will undoubtedly come to this house and request more funds for the Commission, but the Commission must be completely clear about how thin the financial ceiling we are on.We have 1.27 % of GDP of the community.No more euros and no less.It will not be we who refuse these new means, you will have to ask the advice.This financial foresight is coordinated with millimeter.In order to finance your stability plan in the Balkans, a major revision of category 4 must be negotiated, and you will remember the huge difficulties that we had when the household was adopted.I would like to remind you that this faction, the PPE-DE, is reluctant to finance new political initiatives by sacrificing existing ones.The political priorities must be demolished by this parliament and the MEPs.Never believe that the reform of the household that you suggest will conceal the restrictions of the community's financial system.We do well to make all the efforts to be in the household on the mutual consensus, but be fully aware that the inadequacy of the means, the lack of financial autonomy and the poor budget execution are urgently to solve questions.So we ask ourselves: Does the Commission have the political will to solve it?Ms. President, the Commission's communication is well formulated, but so vague that all interpretations are possible.	de
"Further to the budgetary framework at the level of debt, to support vulnerable sectors, such as food safety and humanitarian safety or such as education and health, as well as in the fields of environment, investment or access to information and new technologies, as well as in the trade sector, while also providing other politicians and other politicians. Member States. So we cannot continue something that has proved inadequate and incorrect in the past. Mr President, listening to the Council and the Commission today, maybe I just have to take a look at my daily order. But yes, he really writes ""cohesion of the various Union policies with development policy"". But we didn't hear a single word on this subject, which I find deeply disappointing. We have been waiting for a reference to cohesion for years. We had to be submitted in writing here today, and having heard the speech of Mr. Nielsen, I do not find it difficult to imagine that he is facing extremely powerful forces against the Commission. I know that the Commissioner himself has strong and highly prudent views on the cohesion I would like to hear today. As the joint resolution proposal proposes a series of effective mechanisms to ensure cohesion, I will limit myself to another, in my short speech time, that is, the Commission must also develop new, relevant legislation in this area. I will also focus on the devastating effects of the EU common agricultural policy on developing countries. The rejection of beef dumps in Sahel and South Africa, a tomato paste in West Africa, powder milk in Jamaica, are examples that I hope they are known to everyone. It is, if anything, known to the disgust from the producers of the ACP countries, who are forced to destroy their products because they cannot compete with EU subsidized products. European taxpayers contribute about 40 billion euros annually to the support of the EU agriculture. A sector accounts for 69% of the total workforce as opposed to just 1.7% of the EU. In addition, consider that the agricultural sector is responsible for 34% of the gross national product of developing countries as opposed to 5.3% of the EU. There is no consistency. Why do they refuse to admit both the Council and the Commission? Mr President, the way we will come up with decisions on policies is certainly fundamental. The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and the Foreign Minister made statements about their policy on the Council voting system yesterday. They pointed out that the United Kingdom, France and Germany are now far beyond the other countries of the European Union in the population. They then concluded that the magnitude of the population should be reflected in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not unravel its right to negativity."	el
At the last intergovernmental conference, many forces rally rallied to reach an agreement on Article 13, as the Council spokesman has already reminded us, and the Commission is determined to comply with the Treaty's commitment to a society without discrimination. That is why we proposed our package with the proposals of the fight against discrimination only two months after we took office last year. My message today, then given at the Ludford report, is that we still hope that Parliament will prioritize its opinion on this beam, so that by the end of this year we can approve the two instructions and action program. But beyond that, I believe that in many places, the need for European action against racism is increasingly recognized. That is why I believe that with the proposals referred to in Article 13 we are able to make more progress on the issue of racial discrimination than in other issues. We believed it was politically feasible. We sincerely hope that the events will not deny our hope. As you know, the proposal proposed by the Commission consists of two instructions and an action plan. The two directive plans provide a legislative framework for legally enforcement rights, including provisions on a number of important issues, such as protection against harassment, positive action, appropriate remedies and law enforcement measures. The suggested instructions are complemented by a proposal of action program. We know that, in order to combat discrimination, we need practical action to approach the world and help change the attitudes and behaviors that introduce discrimination. Approval of the proposals against discrimination by Member States is now our priority. Although important, the bundle of Article 13 is only one part of an ongoing process of developing new ways to deal with racial discrimination. The Union is committed to the policy of integrating the dimension of equal opportunities between men and women (mainstreaming) in the fight against discrimination due to racial and national origin, we have recently organized a major conference on this issue. Our intention is to continue to promote the process through structural funds, the Framework Research Program, the European Strategy, the new Equal Initiative and the new social action program that we hope will be approved in the summer. Our goal is to use all these means to combat discrimination and, as you know, work on the European Charter of Fundamental Rights have already begun. Here Parliament has to play an important role. It is vital for the Commission to contribute to parliament to the growing boost taken by these proposals, giving its opinions on the package as soon as possible and fully participating in the drafting of the map of fundamental rights. I will conclude as I started: The map will represent the great priority that the Union overall attributes to the struggle against racism and discrimination and the protection of human rights. I honestly hope, when we discuss this issue of time, we will be pleased with us that we have managed, with the map, to have a new tool for combating racism and xenophobia in the Union.	el
"In addition, a huge warehouse has been built, the building permit and, moreover, the company ""Drogheda Corporation"" is to consult the other infrastructure.How can the Commission guarantee that this type of development, funded thanks to the structural funds, does not jeopardize the efforts necessary for the conservation of nature in the region?Is the commission willing to interrupt any funding pending a revision of the regional planning plans?.(SV) The Commission is aware of the construction of this port, but it had no knowledge of that of this warehouse, nor of the other infrastructures cited by Mrs. La MP.The construction of the port is subject to financial aid from structural funds, and has the main consequence of dredging the mouth of the Boyne river, and the provisional storage of the sediment masses collected on the stegrennan vase leash.The perimeter around the Boyne estuary was classified special protection zone under the directive on wild birds.This means that any operating activity practiced in the river estuary, or nearby, must respect the protection rules that have been set for this region by the community directive on natural habitats.Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints in which the construction of the port would be said to damage the Stegrennan vase leash, which is now part of the protected area, and that the applicable protection rules had not been respected.After examining these complaints during the year 1998 and at the beginning of 1999 - a period during which the project did not receive aid from the structural funds -, the Commission acquired the conviction, during the summer of 1999, that the protection rules had been taken into account for the construction of the port.A detailed study of environmental consequences had been carried out.The most negative consequence of the project, namely the loss of the Stegrennan vase of vase, is only temporary, the entrepreneur in charge of the works being required to rehabilitate the site.At the request of the Commission, the Stegrennan vase leash was formally included in the special protection area of ​​the Boyne estuary, of which it was not before.To compensate for the negative effects of this provisional disappearance of the vase leash on the populations of birds concerned, it was also planned to improve other sites of establishment of these species in the estuary area.However, since the summer of 1999, the latter measure has been the subject of a dispute.The Irish authorities first returned to the initially planned improvement measure.Then they put it into force, following a complaint filed by an ecological non -governmental organization before an Irish court.However, the new provision included minor modifications which led to a new complaint.Given that Ireland has committed compensation measures, and that a number of other problems have now found a solution, the Commission cannot today propose to freeze financial aid from structural funds.Nevertheless, it is ready to examine with the Irish authorities the question of compensatory measures intended to improve certain natural habitats, in particular in the light of legal action which is still continuing before an Irish court."	fr
Since both legal aspects often overlap and violations of the Union budget are increasingly increasing, also committed by organized crime, responsibility among the Member States is unclear.There are also differences in the individual national legal provisions as well as lengthy to unfulfilled mutual requests for legal assistance.The Convention signed by the European Council in 1995 to protect the financial interests and the two subsequent protocols did not change anything.In order to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States.So far, only four have done that after five years.This standstill, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has caused Parliament to stimulate a European law enforcement agency.This should by no means create a transnational criminal law and judicial regulations.Rather, the goal is to equip the Union with specific instruments to protect their financial interests, in compliance with subsidiarity.With today's report, we revitalize this idea again and direct the request to the Commission to submit legislative proposals to implement this goal.The concerns of the Legal Committee from his opinion and the committee for the freedoms and rights of citizens, judiciary and internal affairs are fully involved.We speak out two recommendations that arise from the creation of Olaf and to secure its operational and legal efficiency, transparency and the protection of individual rights.To do this, we need - this is the first recommendation - a legal act in which the criminal offenses to damage the Union's financial interests are covered and leading principles are anchored.In an amendment, I support the proposal period for the Commission until September 30th.The second recommendation concerns criminal proceedings.The Commission, too, should - and also changed by me until May 31, 2000 - to be legally involved in the creation of an independent organism, institutionally connected to the Commission, to coordinate and control the proper investigation.The existing surveillance committee can only control the independence of the office's director.The proposal for such a legal act should contain an independent statute for this organism and define its tasks, which are limited to investigations and internal law enforcement of Olaf to the damage of the Union's financial interests and to its relationships with the national authorities.An influence on justice in the Member States remains excluded.The Court of Justice should take over the legality of the legal file.In addition, we are calling for the upcoming government conference to take the debate about the creation of a European law enforcement agency to protect the Union's financial interests, if possible, created on the basis of the study, which has now been recognized by well -known scientists and is now widely recognized, the so -called Corpus juris, as well as the following feasibility studies.Further support for this project can also be found in the second report of the so -called five wise men.The Commission, Mr. Barnier and Mr. Vitorino, as well as some Member States, are also open to the idea.I ask you, dear colleagues, to your positive vote on this report, which the budget control committee accepted with a large majority.In turn, we can set an example here that the parliament is active to prevent mismanagement and in particular fraud and, where necessary, be punished.President!I am pleased to speak the floor in the pronunciation about this report and to congratulate Ms. Theato.	de
"However, we are very critical of the methods used by these 14 Member States on this issue. The resolution lacks a clear reference to the respect of the national identity and constitutional traditions of the Member States under Article 6 of the Treaty. It also lacks an aspect of EU solidarity of the social and political development of Europe and Austria, which has been one of the prerequisites for Haider's election success. Extreme right -wing - nowadays, as in the past of European history - is the result of uncertain social and economic living conditions. The surgery policy that has followed the adaptation of the emua has promoted the success of far -right. Radical policy for security and justice in each country is the guarantee of European democratic development.- (de) I will give this explanation for my CSU group, the German Christian Socialists. It is unbearable that the EU is intervened in the government policy of its Member State. It does not belong to the EU. Instead of pre -condemning the government of the FPE and Austria, it is necessary to initially evaluate and critically examine the government program and the party program and the policy of the coalition. It is only after the critical evaluation of such a critical policy of such government negotiations that it is possible to determine whether this government is against the Democratic spirit of Europe. This does not mean that we have sympathy for Haider. CSU members of the European Parliament do not know any sympathy for FPE's leader Haider. As politicians, we have to ask why 27 % of the Austrian people chose a party like the FPO in the October 1999 election. We must find out the causes and try to eliminate the causes that led to such a result. Only a study of the stumps and policies represented by FPE may prevent the radicalization of Austria politics. On the other hand, the European Parliament's resolution does not consider the causes of the Austrian election result and does not present the chances of resolution. For this reason, the CSU European Parliament Group is opposed to this resolution..(Fr) ""he knew what the crowd of the joy did not know and what the one who wanted to read about books; the plague bacillon would never die or disappear, it can stay in his sleep for decades in furniture and clothing, it can expect patiently in the living rooms, basements, suitcases and wasteAs a warning to drive his rat death in the middle of his luck, the unmarried city.

"The relocation of the tax burden from work to the consumption of raw materials and mineral resources, on the other hand, provides a sustainable contribution.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis for the report, which he presented to us - not here and today, but in the committee for economy and currency.From a political speaking, it is two completely different reports.In general, we could say that the first report is a report by the left in which the social aspects are addressed in addition to the economic problems.The report that is now available to us and for which my colleague has worked very well in my opinion is ""hybrid"".Based on a structure with social aspects, the most important conclusions are withdrawn.What does Mr Giorgos Katiforis suggest and what can be concluded from the report?He offered us a demanding report in a hopeful Europe in which quantified goals for the desired results should be set.And Europe has progressed with the procedure of quantified goals.For example, why was the proposal to increase the employment population in Europe to 75 % of the population?A 60 % working population is very low compared to Japan or the United States, and with such a low employment rate we cannot produce the same thing as these countries.So we have to increase the employment rate through competitive jobs.As it was for the Lisbon summit, we also have to prepare the workforce through scientific training for the new technologies.In addition, investments must grow at a faster pace.The idea of ​​the Wogau colleague that the workforce must be flexible is an argument that is too well known to all of us.I would like to counter him the example of Portugal, where labor law is inflexible, the unemployment rate is below 5 % - and continued to drop in recent years - because the investments on the community average (undoubtedly with support from the community) increase much faster.Therefore, we are striving for a Europe with economic growth, but also with social considerations.President!Like many of my colleagues, I would like to thank Mr. Katiforis for an interesting report.If I read this and look at the picture drawn there by the EU economy, this is a very worrying picture in my opinion.The investments are too low, unemployment is still far too high and growth is not sufficient.That is why it may not be surprising that the euro loses ground compared to other currencies, despite the rumors of secret support purchases from the European Central Bank.The rapporteur finds that stability is not a goal in itself.I can only agree with that.There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination, but far too little about the factors necessary for innovation and development.In my eyes, the cooperation in the WWU is a heavy colossus that cannot keep up with the enormous flexibility of the economy.However, my conclusions differ from those of my previous speaker.I think you have to rely on the human factor, on the one hand through a macroeconomic policy that creates increased demand and new jobs and, on the other hand, - and perhaps primarily - through measures in working life such as further training, democratization of companies and good social conditions."	de
"I want to formally record my concerns about the Lienemann exhibition and also the reasons that explain the way I voted. We all agree on the need to establish appropriate controls for the protection of our water reserves and also water users. There are many points that deserve to be praised in the approach suggested by the rapporteur for this problem. However, the issue of taxation or fees for the use of water is an issue for which, in accordance with the rules of supplementary, the Member States must decide. I believe it is a mistake to use such a unprocessed means of common European billing on this issue. In Ireland, all the largest water users, the commercial, industrial and agricultural sector, are already paying for the use of water. This is a decision of the national and local government and at this level all future decisions must be maintained. These are the main reasons for the way I voted. The European Union is now in the process of approving new Community water legislation in order to modernize and establish a long -term strategy to ensure the provision of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources, including rivers and coastal waters. I support the goals of this Community action in the field of water policy. However, I do not support the proposal for home water users to be charged for the water they use. Water in this context is a commercial good. It is essential to life itself and people must have free access to sufficient benefit for ordinary daily life. We find it positive that it is sought to reverses water degradation trends, which are extremely worrying and that governments tend to neglect. We all know that water is a good of fundamental importance to humanity, and that there is an urgent need to preserve its quality. But it is equally important to realize that the various parts of water policy are integral to each other and that every action in one of the legs affects all the rest. During the debate, however, as in the context of the proposals, the issue called ""physicochemical and ecological quality of waters"" was overrun and very little, or simply superficially, there was a hint on the devastating effects of other water problems. It is therefore necessary to take into account the different realities in the various Member States, the climatic specifics, the hydrological regimes and their change during the year, as well as the social, economic and environmental consequences of the application of rules and the lack of rules. Our concern about the above issues is what made us disagree with some amendments by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, mainly with those who propose an overly narrow timetable or do not care as much as they should, for social and agricultural aspects,Social and economic development. But we also believe that, in many cases, the proposals of the Commission and the Council are excessively timid, so we have tried to give a balance to our vote, even with the limited range of the amendments that have been subjected to."	el
"This is definitely the view of my colleague's Commission, Wallström, and I know he would have wanted to respond to this resolution today. However, he cannot do it because he is, like a dug -in, mentioned in Hungary and Romania to personally learn about the extent of the damage and to find out how we can best help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to cope with this crisis. We are ready for it. Earlier this month, we contacted the Romanian government and the International Commission of the Danube to receive more information about the accident. Romania has turned to UNEF and Ocha in Geneva to assess the damage in the Danube catchment area. We are ready to help with the assessment if Hungary and Romania make a common request and if the citizens of both countries can be guaranteed access to those areas. Of course, this has a crucial importance. It is quite clear that the extent of the damage must be made as soon as possible, so that we can decide exactly how to deal with it. We are now working to achieve this goal. The legal responsibility of the mining company and the Romanian authorities must also be investigated. It is very important, as more speakers said. The principle of pollutant pays is the cornerstone of the European Union's environmental policy. It is also highlighted in the International Convention on the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube and should be applied in this case. Instead of a mining company, the European Union could not pay any compensation required. Over the last seven years, the Union has granted approximately EUR 20 million to support the protection of the Danube River area. In the context of the preparatory assistant in the area, maybe some of the support of the ISPAR and PHARE programs may be directed to the most serious effects of the accident in the event that the pollutant pays principle is fully followed. In the longer term, we want to find out what can be learned from this accident, and the most important thing is to find out how to prevent the relapse of such accidents first. This case strengthens the need to improve European civil protection in European President Prod in a quiet way, and a couple of members raised this issue today. At the moment, however, the most important thing is to find out this crisis. As I said, my colleague's Commission member Wallström is on the spot today. He will certainly keep the Parliament closely up to date on the actions he suggests on the basis of his visit. This has been a terrifying tragedy to Europe, and Europe must respond to it and do its best to ensure that such terrible accidents will no longer overshadow our future. The discussion has ended. The vote will be made in a moment. Votes.(Fr) The only reason we have voted on the compromise decision of the PSE, Verts/Ale, and the GUE/NGL Groups is that it was the only resolution that we ""condemned the decision of the Goodyear-Tandlop's leadership decision to close its factory"". However, the measures referred to in this resolution are inadequate to end the policy of large industrial groups, which abolish jobs and exacerbate unemployment. Besides, it is only a matter of words, since the majority of socialist government in Europe are as unable to take the necessary measures to prevent these redundancies. The real problem is not to find legal detailed provisions that would make it a little more difficult for these dismissal procedures, but to deny these procedures. The only way to stop this devilish mechanism, which, on the one hand, generates financial added value and, on the other hand, more unemployment is to prohibit these redundancies in all profit -making major companies under the threat of expulsion, to disclose and subjugate large companies under their employees and people. Society must have ways to oblige large companies and their owners to take into account their own priorities, the first of which is to eliminate unemployment. The necessary amounts to create useful jobs in public services and to finance all work, without reducing the wages, must be taken from the profits of large companies."	fi
But it seems clear that PPE, and others on the opposite side, do not want it. We heard a recent speech by Mr. Gollnisch on behalf of his party. Ms Palacio, who is currently leaving, said that human rights must be a public and fundamental issue in the EU. And yet, with their amendments to the Ludford report, they are trying to divide Europe and make a second -class citizens of our nationals. This is the obvious goal of the amendments by Mr Hernandez Mollar and his associates, a goal that remains stable in all amendments on behalf of PPE - the so -called European People's Party - which ultimately proves through his own amendments to be the party alone, not only the party. PPE amendments are intended to divide families. They oppose the family unity. Their amendment no.12 It aims to eliminate the reference to the need for a family unity in Europe. PPE, it seems, does not accept that national minorities feel cut off from the electoral process. It does not consider that the European Parliament and national parliaments must reflect Europe's multinational nature. This is aimed at the amendment no.13. Removes this concerns the report. They are opposed to the national variety and do not accept the benefits of our society from all its peoples. They do not accept that everyone has their role in the electoral process. We cannot complain about what is happening to the candidates to be included if amendments like this are applied to the European Union. PPE, it seems, does not even believe that national minorities should be encouraged to vote. Their amendment no.21 He also deletes the appeal to encourage national minorities to take part in the elections, to elect or to be elected. So do we want this? I don't think. We, on this side of Parliament, reject this position as a whole. We will communicate the position of EPP and its amendments, whether voted on or not. We disapprove of the line proposed by Mr. Hernandez Mollar and his colleague. We call on the Liberal team to separate its position from PPE on these amendments, because it has proven that this party has racist instincts in its bosom. If the PPE amendments to this report are adopted we will vote against the entire report. PPE amendments weaken the report and make the position of this parliament worse than the current one. It will weaken it so much that we will not be able to support it. Would be a setback. For this reason, I appeal to all colleagues to reject the amendments proposed by the European People's Party and his far -right colleagues. Mr President, thank everyone who talked about my report. I would just like to clarify some misunderstandings. First, nowhere in my report does it say that the treatment of racism implies a ban on migratory controls.	el
However, I still have a little concern, listening to the Commissioner, compared to the commitments which were made by the services in the Budget Commission.It had been clearly agreed - I do not say that it was a good or a bad thing, but it was a contract - it had been clearly agreed between the services of the Commission and the Budget Commission that there was agreement on amendments 4 and 7, that is to say that there was an agreement on the idea of ​​linking the mobilization, the implementation, the second trancheby donors.However, I thought I understand, listening to Mr. Solbes, that this commitment should be made in dotted lines.Mr. Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.Yes or no, do you confirm the agreement that was taken by your services in budget commission or do you release this conditionality, which would be a break in commitment to us?No, Mr. Bourlanges, I think it is a fundamental problem.The problem is: how to instrument the compromise that we have accepted.What I have proposed to you, that I am still saying to you is that the Commission will make a declaration, in the decision of the Council, in the following sense: it will be decided in time useful of the exact amount and the precise calendar of the second tranche taking duly account for the evolution of the external financing needs of Kosovo and the contributions of other bilateral donors.In this sense, we believe that we respect completely what we have concluded.I simply ask the Commission, before implementing the second tranche, to come and inform the budget commission.I agree with it, and we will.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.Altener The agenda calls for the report (A5-0011/2000) of Mr. Langen, on the common project, approved by the conciliation committee, decision of the European Parliament and the Council stopping a multi -year program for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370 (COD)).Mr. President, I thank Mr. Langen - Although he is not himself here present - for the work he has accomplished to have the program adopted both in Parliament and at the Council.The project was long and difficult.We must continue to promote in particular the studies devoted to the analysis of the use of renewable energy sources.Even if the new directive conceals many advantages, it also has faults.An example is the use of peat.Peat should not be classified in the same category as fossil fuels.If peat cannot be directly classified as a renewable energy source, non -fossil, it must be defined as a separate class, especially for environmental taxation.It is not fair that we apply the same criteria to peat as to the coal for example.The promotion of renewable energy sources is a partial solution in order to remove the dependence on the union with regard to imported energy.	fr
Several questions remain unanswered, however.Thus, the program does not seem to give any priority to the fight against AIDS.The situation on this plan in Africa has today become so serious that AIDS kills more than armed conflicts.I hope the minister will devote a little of his time to this problem.Drugs exist in the United States, but the United States markets it at an too high price for African populations.I would like to ask the minister what he is doing exactly about the situation that develops in Ethiopia, where drought has settled, causing the loss of crops, and where, in six months, will inevitably happen again the scenario that we have already known a few years ago, with famine and people dying by thousands.Meanwhile, Eritrea and Ethiopia have war and European arms industry does not hesitate to send rifles, after which we will send bread.Mr. MP, you will understand that I do not agree with the reading you make of my colleague's intervention during the meeting of the Development Commission;There is no contradiction between these positions, on the contrary.Unless we show megalomania, we could not engage in our program of the presidency to a sort of exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginable situations concerning all the major questions posed, in particular within the framework of external relations.You will understand that nothing would have been easier.It was enough to take a glossary on development and to note all the points one after the other.We are responsible enough to see that we must only take the points that we can manage within the framework of our presidency and what is - we must be always aware of it - the capacity of governments within the Council.We must see what are the limits to management, in particular national indicative programs.The deputy mentioned the issue of Ethiopia, which is part of the national indicative programs, but as you know there are different community actions to combat AIDS.You are right on this point Mr. MP, the United States will probably not do better.Furthermore, in terms of development assistance policy, I think that Europe has no reason to worry simply because our behavior in the matter has nothing to envy that of the United States.The question of the deputy stems from the question of the problem of armament, it is a broader question of political nature, which seems to me not to fall within the framework of this question but that the council will obviously envisage in the future if it wishes and if it decides to replace it in a specific context.Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food products by the European Union to developing countries below the production price?	fr
"In all cases, people have been ideologically incited to take action. There is also a different kind of racism that is daily teasing and humiliation. It comes up as a discrimination when applying for homes, leisure activities or jobs. You all know an example that has recently been featured in the French press about the young Strasbourgian who sent two exactly similar CV to the same company. One had a foreign -sounding name and the other typically a French name. You can guess which of these two ""applicants"" was invited to the interview. Similarly, we must not settle for defending those who are classified as minorities;We have to get out of this different ghetto. There is no minority that has to be defended, but European citizenship that needs to be developed by paying attention to common values, a majority that wants a common future, a majority that wants to build a majority of all society, which wants to combat all the efforts to lower us to the raw level. During its history, Europe has been able to be good and bad. Good is represented by the UN Declaration of Human Rights and the Geneva Convention, but the bad ones are the example of colonial, Jewish stains, Stalinism and Nazism. We have to teach all this to our children. We must finally choose what strengthens Europe and fight what weakens it, while clearly showing what kind of society we want to build. I say directly: Those who think that with extremist groups can be aligned to overcome election, wipe out and finally throw into the scrap bin of history, because with Haider or Le Pen, allocating with a devil must be a long spoon, but if they want to eat with them, the spoon is never long. I also want to remind them, the words of Clémenceau, to the mind of those preaching ethnic nation,: ""Patriotism is the love of their own country, nationalism is the hate of others.""They have really chosen their own camp. All of this now needs to be moved to a practical level through legislative measures. Anti -racism legislation must be harmonized and the meaning of words is given. Equal opportunities mean that all children born in Europe can gain European citizenship and enjoy the right to the soil they were born. Equal rights mean the right to vote and to combat all forms of discrimination, regardless of whether this is a discrimination or geographical, social or breed -based discrimination in a particular sector. In this way, the values ​​we are fighting for. The Mr President, as I emphasized yesterday, is important to me that the human rights issue is addressed here specifically on the French soil, which, together with North America, is kind of the cradle of these principles. However, it seems to me that it is sometimes not clear enough to be clearly remembered for what these rights that are being associated with or which are to be linked to international agreements as rights that are not provided for in the Conventions. For example, there is no right to migration. Of course, a migrant from outside the European Union has the right to enjoy his or her rights, but that restrictions and control measures are imposed on migration cannot be classified as racism, and cannot be classified as a stranger, precisely because there is no value for the court in any text. On the other hand, unattended immigration is an impossible idea, if not otherwise for numbers and regional reasons. And sometimes the rights must also be borne in mind. An example is the Roma discussions. Of course, the Roma have their rights, they should not be discriminated against, but many of them I do not even claim that it is a majority, but certainly many, as statistics show, do not live in law. Many of them take advantage of their women and, above all, their children. Often, poorly treated and poorly dressed children can be seen, and this is intentionally doing the pity of a passer -by and getting a few Rovos."	fi
So do you have any impression of how these discussions can evolve in the DD? Mr. MPs, the issue of expanding the syndicated process to other issues of legislative content is something that has been discussed at the intergovernmental conference and, as you know, has traditionally expressed the most radical position, which is also supported by many Member States, that is to say,co -options with the European Parliament. This is a position that is widely accepted within the intergovernmental conference, although there are Member States in favor of a case -by -case examination of cases to be subject to the co -operation process, even on issues related to the law. As for the ratification of international agreements, I already had the opportunity to put the problem at the Intergovernmental Conference and, in a first debate on the matter, this constant demand and this position of the European Parliament did not seem to enjoy widespread acceptance by the Member States, so we would not believe that in the parties,It remains on the agenda, since all the issues remain on the agenda until the end of the intergovernmental. We will not, however, cease to have a dialogue with the European Parliament on this issue. Next Tuesday I will have a meeting with the Committee of Constitutional Affairs, on the occasion of which I will discuss this issue and grant more and more detailed clarifications on how the Intergovernmental Conference is handled in the way of the intergovernmental conference, and in particular how it is dealingWe hope that it will be enriched with the resolution to be approved on the 23rd of the month. Question No.6 (H-0160/00): Subject: Compensation for the victims of the fascist War Many decisions of Greek courts have confirmed the compensation that Greek citizens are entitled to as victims of the Nazi regime, while remaining pending, and have not yet been paid to Germany, and have not yet been paid to Germany. Germany from the Bank of Greece in 1943. It intends to take initiatives to give legal compensation to the victims of the fascist war and to refund the occupation loans and in the light of the recent agreement signed by Germany for the compensation of the Germans. The formal reason for Germany to satisfy the above legal and purely well -founded claims? Mr. MPs, the answer to this question is very easy: the issue to which the question refers is not the responsibility of the Council but is part of the bilateral relations between Greece and Germany. Consequently, the Council is not responsible for proceeding with any step, and in particular those proposed by the MP. Mr President, you will allow me to consider the main presidency's response in response to Pontius Pilate. How do things have? During the Occupation, the German occupation government forced the Greek occupation government to give it a loan, which today with interest and inflation is about $ 25 billion.	el
In Tampere, the eye was made to distribute operational skills.We are still calling for a revision of the agreement to bring in better parliamentary and judicial control options.The agreement should also be viewed critically in terms of Eurodac.The parliament modified the contract text.It must be ensured that the council goes compliant with the procedure of parliament.Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet been launched on the other topics.We are currently waiting for it.Europe as a space of freedom, security and law has so far been an area without a clear regulation in important areas.However, we owe this to the citizens of Europe.After hearing the words of Interior and Justice Minister, I am optimistic.I assume that we will succeed in the next six months.President, Mr. Commissioner, revered colleagues, I think Ms. Terrón I Cusí's oral request hit the mark, because six months after the newly elected Parliament has been appointed, we have to be able to send out a decisive political message to European citizens.In my opinion, the Portuguese presidency can contribute in a positive way.In the meantime, we all know what infinitely large expectations our fellow citizens have in terms of freedom, security and justice, especially social justice.The disinterest of the citizens, their distance, sometimes even their aversion to politics force us to take concrete measures in view of their difficulties.This is the essential prerequisite for reconciling citizens with politics.In order for Europe to become a symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a brave and generous policy to get the weakest to help.A real plan to combat unemployment must be implemented, because this scourge is the breeding ground for racism, xenophobia, nationalism and right -wing extremist racist movements.The weakest are - and it is important that I go into this point - the immigrants and the refugees.In this way, the almost continuous inability to inherit the criminalization of asylum seekers can no longer be tolerated.Every asylum seeker must have the right to a fair hearing and appeal.Last week I was more by chance at Roissy Airport witness to a scene of hard -to -surviving violence, in which two young women who had probably entered secretly were deported to Conakry.They were treated like serious criminals.They were naked, were dragged over the ground on the hair and guarded by a Horde CRS standby police officer.The Portuguese presidency must put an end to such barbaric practices.On the contrary, our task is to accompany those who escape a dictatorship, to help them, help them and offer security.The Commission proposed the creation of a European fund for refugees.The parliament welcomed this proposal very much.Instead of debating the middle equipment provided for this fund, you should take the decision to set up this fund.The presidency and the council can concretize the points that were rejected in Tampere for inexplicable reasons, even if tampere forms an important basis.Likewise, we cannot be satisfied with the fact that xenophobia increases in Europe and discrimination is becoming more and more common without taking comprehensive countermeasures.	de
Finally, the demand concerns the future competencies of the European Parliament in the areas of competition policy and state aid for debate with a view to the government conference.In our report, as you know, Mr. Commissioner, the idea is represented that the co -decision procedure should apply to the adoption of basic legal texts on state aid.President, Herr Commissioner, my very worshiped ladies and gentlemen!My part in today's debate concerns the steel aid code.These are public aids in Europe that were awarded according to this code and which the Commission has checked.That is a total of 27 cases in 1998. The Commission submitted its own report on these cases.The EGKS contract will expire shortly.Therefore, the question that has to deal with today is, in particular, the one how the steel aid will be handled in the future.The European Parliament's decisions, which are presented in the report, are welcomed, including the decision to reclaim funds in a specific case and thus apply Article 88 of the EGKS contract.The competitiveness of the European steel industry is also the content of the recent communication of the Commission, which we have not yet advised in parliament.As in other areas, the general aid ban according to Article 87 paragraph 1 of the EC Treaty applies to the iron and steel industry.According to this article, state aid is generally incompatible with the common market.Exceptions are only allowed in precisely defined cases.According to Article 88, the Commission is obliged to control state aid.In 1998 the greatest case was the supply of equity to Preussag in Germany of 540 million euros.In addition, the Member States of the Commission have to provide their aid project beforehand.For the area of ​​the steel industry, the applicable rules were set up on December 18, 1996.According to this, aid in favor of the steel industry can only be awarded in certain, precisely defined cases.Research and development aids, environmental protection aids, social aid to promote the closure of steelworks and aid for final operating tasks for non-competitive companies.In addition, there is a special regulation of up to 50 million euros for the Member State of Greece.Obviously, however, there have been problems in the practical handling of the steel aid code in recent years, which were not completely discussed in the report.From the point of view of parliament, it is important that today there is already talk about a connection regulation after the expiry of this steel aid code.A softening of the existing basic lines of the steel code must not be decided.Nobody wants an uninhibited subsidy race in Europe.This would significantly affect the internal market even after the steel industry consolidated in recent years.Therefore, the parliament considers it necessary that the steel subscription code is changed with regard to the unequal treatment claimed by industry and that the Commission submits a succession plan to the Council.It is known that the Council has previously refused to decide on such a succession plan.This is also due to the fact that if the steel aid code expires, you can do what you want without the annoying control by the European Commission.We therefore demand that after the contract has expired, the steel aid must be regulated by a council regulation according to Article 94, because only this is the necessary legacy and clarity.	de
As a member of parliament, we must particularly emphasize that the process initiated to strengthen fundamental rights is gaining in importance than ever because the perception and inviolability of human values ​​as well as the rights of minorities, including the rights of all people living in the field of European Union, are an essential part of the principle of the rule of law in the European Union.Therefore, the charta of fundamental rights must also be legally binding.It must not only remain an explanation.The support of democratic forces in Austria is just as important, none of us want to exclude Austria.We know that most Austrians pay attention to these values.You also demonstrated;Not all demonstrations have taken place outside of Austria.There are certainly many protest voters on the move who have long wanted to change in Austrian politics.In my opinion, the parliament must support these democratic forces.I also appeal to the Austrian President to explore all options so that a government can be formed from democratic forces.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen, I just want to emphasize the importance of an attitude, as the chairman of our faction, Francis Wurz, just remembered.I welcome the explanations of the Council Presidency and the 14 Member States, which reject official bilateral contacts with the Austrian government in the event of a participation in the government of Jörg Haider.It is all the more important that we point out to this as we are essentially disagreed with the policy of the European Union - their economic and social policy, their democratic deficit or the involvement of their Member States in the dramatic beam client.This disagreement gives even more weight to today's recognition: it is exceptional in that the risk of rebirth of a contradictory neo -fascist component in Europe is extraordinary.This danger does not affect Austria, but Europe.We speak of ourselves, not Austria.We know the social causes that, together with unemployment and uncertainty, help to stir up in this direction;We know the cultural adjoining causes such as peoples and racism, but we cannot avoid that the inability and the lack of will of those right -wing extremists can create an explosive mixture in Europe for settlement with fascism.It is about the Alpine region, about all of our countries: conditions are created from which a danger to democracy and European civilization can grow again.The chairmanship has made it clear with his statement that he is aware of this dramatic situation for civilization.Europe proves that Auschwitz has not forgotten;Europe meets a soul.Now, however, it should be consistent and act accordingly, and the first thing that would have to be consistent would have to be consistent, which in this case has shown an unclear and undecided attitude through which the importance of the opinion of the council becomes even more obvious.In this sense, the action of the Commission must be corrected.Mrs. President, values ​​and colleagues, as to what the democratic basic principle of respect for human rights as well as freedom and sovereignty of the peoples, which conflicts every new or old fascism, Nazism or communism - and all of the previous speakers have spoken about the sovereignty of the Austrian people - we find that this sovereignty is being denied by our parliament today.	de
Nothing to prevent the expansion of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the large companies from only to pushing part of the population into misery!If this report is due to earnings, it is that it has made it clear that the working majority of society has nothing to hope for with regard to maintaining or even improving their conditions of existence..(FR) By voting against this report, we speak for all those who have expressed their rejection of a world in Seattle and everywhere in Europe that is reduced to a pure market logic.We vote against this report in the name of the development of public services, especially in memory of the victims of the train accident of Paddington, whose death was not inevitable, but was in the account of the absurd striving to give competition where regulation would be necessary.This report is basically a primitive elaborate that is inspired by nothing else than the law of the jungle, because the competition cannot solve any of the problems that humanity faces at the beginning of the new century.Be it the balance of the biosphere, the promotion of culture or cooperation with the Third World, the uninhibited competition is a factor of regression and uncertainty.Do you think that the 18 million unemployed in Europe are victims of being too tentative of this competition policy?We are convinced of the opposite, and we also do not believe that the state aid are generally too high.According to which iron rule, according to which effectiveness criteria should you be?After Seattle, do you think it is serious to support a larger role of the WTO?So much throatness only fits the legal advisors of the multinational corporations.Report Jonckheer (A5-0087/1999).(FR) I welcome the quality of the seventh report on state aid in the EU, the annual publication of this report and the fact that the general directorate on its website spreads general information that is intended for the public.I am happy about the rapporteur's approach with regard to the state aid.Too often, one tends to scourge state aid as a violent measures.Certainly, an efficient competitive policy is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market and the economic and monetary union.Nevertheless, as the rapporteur emphasizes, such aid is often essential, not only as a contribution to the survival of one or the other company, but also for sustainable development (Article 6 EGV), to the service of general interest (Article 16) and on economic and social cohesion (Article 158).But of course they have to be checked, and this is the task of the European Commission.The aid granted annually by the eum-member states to the sectors that came into consideration in the period 1995-1997 to a total of 95 billion euros, of which 40 % of whom went to the processing industry.These aid has decreased significantly compared to the previous period 1993-1995 (decline by 13 % of the total amount and 3.8 % to 2.6 % of the aid volume for the processing industry).The decline in the aid is essentially explained by the reduction of the aid for the new German federal states.	de
"It must also be clarified what to do if state aid is declared illegal.How can we ensure that illegal state aid are repaid?There are no common regulations in this area at the moment, and we are emphatically asking the Commission to harmonize the regulations for repayment.This is the right way to create similar competitive conditions.As already mentioned by some colleagues, we also suggest a register and also a ""scoreboard"", from which it can be seen which level the countries have with regard to state aid.Here, Mr. Monti, we have taken up your suggestion regarding the internal market index regarding.This inspired us to propose the same for state aid.I very much hope, Commissioner Monti, that you will support this proposal and I look forward to your comments and your opinion.Finally, I welcome the XXVIII.Competition report of the Commission, which, like previous reports, was well done.However, as I said, our primary goal must be transparency and openness.It is important to constantly develop the transparency and openness of state aid and to direct our efforts to these areas.This is not least important for the upcoming expansion.I would like to thank Mr. Jonckheer, who deals with the associated problems very thoroughly in his report.He examines how we can ensure that these countries meet our requirements, but also how equal competitive conditions are created.Of course, liberal and green different views are about how the world should be, but we largely agree on the goals and will try to find a reasonable solution to our problems.President, Mr. Commissioner, we simply have two questions to answer.Are state aid for companies or agreements between companies in a market economy legitimate, and who should control these exceptions from the absolute rules of the market economy?At the first point, we clearly say that if the requirements of sustainable development that the European Union strives to be taken into account, state aid must be granted to the company, be it in the form of tax exemptions, of differentiated taxation or simply by direct aid.It is also legitimate that there are agreements between companies or self -limitation agreements that make it possible to reduce the negative effects of the competition with regard to social or ecological demands.So we say clearly and clearly, yes, it is legitimate that there is aid and that there can be conventions, but we also say that each of these agreements must be expressly justified.The Wogau report suggests that the control of the legitimacy of such measures are transferred to the national responsibility.We see a certain danger in this, but we will still vote for it, because we see that the Commission cannot do everything.We demand that the greatest transparency be kept and that the Commission granted more reconciliation to check the legitimacy of these exceptional regulations afterwards.Mr President, once again we debate about the competitive policy of the European Union.But - under what conditions this pronunciation actually takes place and what conclusions should we draw?"	de
The situation in the refugee camps of Inguschetia is bad and worsens;In most cases there is no warm meal all day.The Russian authorities no longer provide it, so it is the non -governmental organizations that take care of it.In Grosny there are currently around 20,000 people in a really desperate location, they have to run for miles to find something to eat.But there is something that can be described as a positive movement that I also want to inform you about.The European Council's representative informed me that the Russian authorities accepted the involvement of employees of the European Mission last night with the President and the Foreign Minister who are currently under the direction of the Russian authorities in Grosny, and that they were in negotiations with the incumbent presidency of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE)employees of this organization could also be included.This is the only positive that I can transmit to you at the moment;I hope that in the next few hours we will receive more information from the representative, Mr. Gil-Robles, and above all better news about the authorities of the Russian Federation.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!I hereby come to the end and just want to repeat what I already said at the beginning.It is a great satisfaction to be able to participate in the activity of this parliament, to participate in the work that is carried together by all states and together with the Commission and the clear goal of which our European Union can participate in the international level with the greatest possible weight.Europe is not there to wage war somewhere, but to work together so that there is peace and stability all over the world.I thank Mr. Solana very warmly and give the word Mr. Poettering on behalf of the group of the European People's Party European Democrats.Thank you, Mr. Poettering.It goes without saying that a contribution by Commissioner Patten would be extremely appropriate in this debate.And we agreed to give him the word as soon as he wishes.Would you like to speak now, Mr. Commissioner, or a little later?(The Commissioner indicates that he wants to speak later.) Good, thank you.Ms. President, Mr. Commissioner Patten, Mr. Javier Solana!Usted no es una persona loca, Todo lo contrario.We welcome the quick progress that were reached after the Helsinki summit.It is known what important role you played.I am also pleased that in this context you mentioned Mozambique and the great humanitarian aid that can be provided with these means.Of course, we cannot talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya.My friend Jacques Poos will speak in the name of our faction afterwards.At this point I want to concentrate on Kosovo.The situation in Kosovo shows all too clearly that military means cannot bring about a long -term solution to the crisis there.The KFOR armed forces have performed important and invaluable services there and continue to do so, but armored cars and rifle defense cannot solve political problems and ethnic contrasts in the long run.	de
Of course, every case of a miserable urban area is separate. However, there is a combination, a hard core consisting of unemployment, withdrawal or degeneration of public services, and the loss of commercial and other SMEs. I wish the Urban Initiative would, above all, try to give answers to these causes of the misery of urban areas. This requires, of course, consensus and consistent of central policy with development policy so that it also works with the goals that are driven by Urban initiative, and these programs would not only be presented as a pretext for its absence. Mr President, Member of the Commission, Good Colleagues, I will focus on Francis Decourrière's report in my speech. Interreg program Interreg is an extremely important tool for the development and planning of the European region, especially when it comes to effectively taking into account the relationship between the central and edge areas of the European Union. Thus, Interregin must be a tool that promotes the regional cohesion of the Union if we do not want to divide the European region into two or even three different groups of development. In my opinion, it is clear that the regional and local authorities, as well as the organizations representing these, the regional committee and, of course, the European Parliament should have been brought in more clearly and as early as possible in the design of this program. However, it must be noted that the Commission has not worked so much in the preparation of its disclosure on October 13. Although I agree to the general guidelines for Interreg III, I think it is really important to ensure that this European Regional Development Fund ERDF is better coordinated by other outward cooperation funds, especially the European development fund for supporting ACPs. Therefore, I would like to thank the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for accepting one of the revision I have submitted, in which the European Development Fund EKR has added to the list of these funds. Particularly remote regions, especially four French seafood department, must be able to reconcile Interreg III and BC, so that they can also finance cooperation projects with their own geographical ACTs. In addition, I ask the Commission to consider closely the minor opportunities that are provided in particularly remote areas and island areas. Like all other areas of the Union, these areas must be able to fully utilize Interreg III in full, as the Regis program, which was intended for the development of these areas, is no longer valid. In the end, I would like to regret the small amount of funding reserved for sub-area C, which is intended for inter-regional cooperation, which, however, adds undeniable value to the community. Mr President, my starting point is the report on the Equal initiative and equality between men and women, even though I admit that it is sometimes boring to have discussions about this issue, which at least for my age, is always discussed again. However, it should be noted that equality has still not been realized. However, a breakthrough in this case might be possible to change in other matters. Namely, my perception of equality is not that each spouse works full-time and that the children are left to the nanny, that is, to an immigrant who has not had the opportunity to get any other job. So we have not made any progress since the time of the solar king. Equality means that we all participate in both work and family life. However, the development does not go in this direction, on the contrary. Therefore, I think paragraph 7 includes a very central issue. It says that the main idea of ​​the Equal program is to act as a test laboratory to promote and disseminate new methods to implement employment policy. We can only hope that it will succeed. Mr President, with regard to the rules of procedure, I would just say that if I was not present when the Commission gives its answer -not because I have asked some special questions, but I hope the Commission has listened -because of the fact that at the same time as the discussion here in the Women's Rights and Equality Committee.	fi
This is related to the disputes of visuals for the development cooperation that exists between different countries of the Union. We should no longer consider development cooperation as a means of external relations, but as a autonomous field of politics. I am in favor of a transparent, solidarity and effective development policy. As a European approach to development policy remains ineffective and contributes to the waste of money, it is advisable to give the Member States. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission the document, to which I am referring to send it as soon as possible to the European Parliament, so that we can effectively reflect on possible solutions..(PT) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues I believe that this initiative is an important and very good initiative. As various colleagues have already mentioned, we often observe situations of great contradiction, on the one hand, what we are advised to do on the policy of growth and cooperation, and on the other hand we overthrow with other sectoral policies whose interests are opposed to the development of the same countries. And we are not just talking about the specific impact of our common policies, tourism, environment, agriculture, fishing, industry, we are generally talking about something that is more serious, we are talking about contradictions between our economic and commercial policies and political defense. After all there is a set of situations that are contradictory. In my opinion these contradictions are not so serious in terms of Community policies. As for specific goals and industries of some Member States, then yes it is more serious. We need to understand this. We often establish resolutions on peace processes elsewhere on the globe on the one hand, as has been recently with Indonesia, a case of glaring, and on the other, we discover that there were some European countries that provided them with weapons and war material. These are for me the very important serious contradictions in this issue, more serious than the contradictions of some incompatibility between the sectoral policies that also exist. It is clear that we know that even within a specific country there are always contradictions between the various policies. It's normal. And in the European Union we must also realize that there will be contradictions between the various common policies, in this case development policy. We need to realize that these contradictions exist and that we must minimize them. This goal of minimizing contradictions is a wise and fair objective that forms the basis of submitting this resolution. I believe that it is very wise and important to create an observatory of evolution of this cohesion between Community policies and political cooperation and development whose field of action should not be confined to Community policies, but also include the actions or policies of the Member States, including the actions of economic groups, which is important. This observatory should each year a report on the evolution and impact of these policies and their combinations. I left for the end an issue that in my opinion is fundamental and which must be included and approved by this parliament.	el
"I would like to understand if this is the meaning in his own language. Please the rapporteur to clarify it and say what his own version is saying, because the meaning is completely the opposite..(It) I would like to help the plenary, Mr President. I read the text in French and says just the opposite. On the one hand, the Italian text says ""not to imprison those who exploit children"", which seems unthinkable to me, and, on the other hand, the French says ""not to imprison children who are criminated"". I think the original is the last one. This is a pretty serious translation error and it certainly did not translate it in Italian. I think the original says ""not to imprison children who are only criminally criminally as a ultimate solution"". I think this is this., rapporteur.(Da) I can confirm that Mr Imbeni's interpretation is the right one. The Italian, Danish and English version are correct. What Mr Imbeni said..(It) Mr President, if the concept of paragraph changes, then we should resume the discussion. It is obvious that in parliament very often the texts do not coincide. Do you remember when, a few months ago, did we ask the priests to share condoms? Now, in some odds, we need to protect those who exploit children! If now, Mr President, the performance also changes in English, we will have a new discussion and I don't think - as your plane is leaving at 4.30 - that is the time to do so. It would probably be simpler if we stopped at the party, where he says: ""physical and psychological violence and any kind of discrimination.""The problem of the possible codification of the behavior of the criminals of minors can be considered later, in one of the many other reports that this parliament can prepare..(EN) If the body agreed we could overcome all the difficulties we face with linguistic yields by introducing a separate paragraph - either as part of paragraph 45 or as new paragraph 45 (a) - where it will be reported ""and pushes them not to imprison young people who commit offenses. This would be completely overcome the difficulty. There is no ambiguity, there is no uncertainty. This is quite reasonable. Would be imported between paragraphs 45 and 46 that already exist. On paragraph 61 :, rapporteur.(DA) Mr President, in Danish, some words have been omitted in point 61. The English version is the correct one. In the Danish edition, after the word ""associations"" the following must be added: ""of the rights of individuals to the latter"". Consequently, this is not only the right to create trade unions, but also the rights that individuals have over trade unions.(The House approves the resolution) As things are, we have a report by Mr Provan in which the Bureau examines how the plenary operates. We had a discussion on Tuesday on this issue in the bureau and I expressed exactly the same view as you."	el
"We intend to draw up a multi -year action plan. There will be reference to this on our website. I therefore hope that NGOs have the feeling that they are involved in what we do. We are largely dependent on their active support and their understanding. I would like to mention another area that is very interested in NGOs, although they are not always so directly involved in it: it is specifically the whole area of ​​research, in which we have made 17 million euros of more than 40 million euros in the last full year, in 1998. But I can generally assure it. They have a lot to contribute to this important project. Question No.41 by K. (H-0212/00): Subject: Initiative ""Dialogue on Europe"" The chairman of the committee intends the implementation of the initiative to begin on March 8th. Under the Commission's announcement, the purpose of the initiative is to explain to the public opinion of the fifteen the impact of the DD 2000. Since this initiative is part of the Prince to inform the European citizen, has the Commission think of including the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Mr President, with the agreement of the European Parliament, the Commission has taken the initiative to develop what we call a ""dialogue on Europe"", which will allow us to more at stake in the reform of institutions in the prospect of enlargement. The Commission estimates that all the institutional issues that may be linked to the intergovernmental conference is indeed included in the field of this debate that has begun. So this is true, and so I answer your question, and on the issue of the map of fundamental citizens' rights. In full consent to Mr Vitorino, I can assure you of the Commission's willingness to develop, in a close relationship with parliament and your representatives, both at the intergovernmental conference and at the map negotiation meeting, a dialogue on all the thoughts that are expressed today. This dialogue on Europe will be developed with all national and regional institutions, but also with exchanges of views, with the media and with civil society organizations. The purpose of the Charter of Fundamental Rights itself justifies this perfectly. Mr President, I would like to thank the Commission for its response, for which I express my satisfaction for two reasons. Firstly, because it links the map of fundamental rights to the intergovernmental conference - and this is the political objective of this parliament in the Messrs. In addition, I was particularly pleased with Mr Lamy's response - something expected, as Mr Lamy is well aware of these issues - about the decentralization of the information campaign. I believe that this is a very important goal because if we are to hear the citizens, there is no other solution than to go where they are, and consequently the decentralization of the information campaign is a primary goal."	el
Will the legal basis be enough today to legal justify the creation of a new specifically community criminal law which, although subsidiary, will always compete, in practice and in certain areas, with the traditional and plot criminal law of the Member States?Given the doubts, would it not be more correct to include the reform of the judicial system on the agenda of the CIG, by introducing these proposals into the more general reform of the Union's judicial system, like what we ask for the European prosecutor?Are these matters not in the highest interest in revising the treaties which contributes to the solidity of the space of freedom, security and justice in the Union?Mr. President, the EU is today the subject of severe surveillance.Confidence in the European Union has deteriorated a lot.Energic measures are necessary to remedy it.We therefore welcome that increased resources have been allocated to Olaf, in order to effectively follow up on all suspicions.At the same time, we consider obviously the principle that people who have committed reprehensible acts against the EU have to assume responsibility.It is regrettable that the Convention on the Protection of the Protection of Union's economic interests is only applied by a small number of Member States.This is why we believe that it would be good to entrust the Commission the task of presenting proposals which imply the development of the already existing legal framework.On the other hand, I am not convinced that these efficiency gains have to involve the implementation of common European legislation or the centralization of the fight against this type of crime.In this context, I am therefore skeptical with regard to the creation of a function of European prosecutor, which it seems to me very difficult to carry out within the framework of the current treaty.We believe more in the Eurojust program, which allows national prosecutors to collaborate.The major problem is not the absence of prosecution against the authors of criminal acts committed at the expense of the Union, but the fact that these acts are so frequent and that they are so rarely discovered.The challenge for the commission and for ourselves, however, consists in finding the right dosage.The scams and the negligence that occur should not have the consequence of locking ourselves in a hierarchical and outdated bureaucracy, where excessive control exerted on details prevents evolution towards modern administration.We therefore welcome the offensive perspective that characterizes the Van Hulten report.The line to follow must assign itself to give each administration the responsibility of its own control.Our experience of a modern administrative functioning shows that the opening, decentralization of responsibilities and a truly competent assessment are just as effective as a bureaucratic and polent control.The major challenge here amounts to creating a modern and effective administration without losing anything from the point of view of legal certainty or our capacity for control.This requires specific training, more modern recruitment methods, and above all, transparency and opening of the system.The best protection against irregularities is an effective possibility of the administration.	fr
This has been discussed for four years.The Commission must change its internal organizational structures and strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of their measures.Ideally, this could be done by a special working group for the area of ​​land mines, which is equipped with the necessary financial resources.Furthermore, faster contract and implementation procedures, an extended multi-year budget line and a significantly improved management of the programs provided by the Commission would be required.A proper evaluation of the effectiveness of programs to clear land mines must be carried out in every country in which country mines are a serious problem.In my view, the problem of land mines is also concerned with many of the difficulties in the organizational, process -related and operational area as well as the financial administration with which the Commission and the Union have to deal.Do these problems belong to the past, or will we find that the European Union is still unable to achieve its goals in this relatively compact and limited area?President, dear colleagues!Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new EU AKP agreement is an important step towards more coherence.And it is good that criteria such as human rights, democracy, the rule of law, good governance are increasingly anchored in this new contract than before that not so much colonial relationships are not so much of the majority of our relationships, but that these political criteria have been given a stronger weight here.Because that is the prerequisite for any development.If these criteria are not met, then development has no chance.That, colleague Modrow, also applies to Cuba.I welcome Cuba to approach this process.But there is still a lot of change in Cuba.We all also know the reports from Amnesty International.It may be that you may see this as one of the last rulers of communism as one of the last rulers of communism and that you have problems with good governance.Nevertheless, this is an important criterion for the European Union.I want to address a second topic.We talk about coherence here.Many colleagues have given examples of the extent to which the different politics are not coherent.But in my view, development policy as such also needs a little more coherence.It is not coherent if the coordination with the Member States still does not work if there are sometimes very opposing projects by Member States and the European Union in developing countries.It is also not coherent compared to the European taxpayer if we do a development policy that is set in the Union's budget, but the EEF remains outside.President of the Council, if you achieve this 13.5 billion euros in the future, is subject to control of the parliament of the budget control committee, which is subject to mechanisms like Olaf, then I think they increase the degree of acceptance.I think this should also be a claim for the government conference: the anchoring of the EEF in the budget of the European Union.In our opinion, Mr. President, Ladies and Ladies, in our opinion, this text is pursuing good intentions, but we still did not agree to him in the committee, and in the plenary session we will not vote for two reasons, which by the way, which, incidentally, have caused us to provide some amendments that I would like to explain here briefly.	de
"Faced with this neoliberal globalization, under the domination of the financial markets, the requirement, of which our request testifies, grows, of another idea of ​​the world according to which the common law would be that which dictates the duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world.No one can ignore the challenge of civilization that constitutes the lack of almost a billion jobs.The need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development, access to knowledge.In this regard, all ideas deserve an examination and we believe that that of the Tobin tax is an important one, just like other forms of transactions which are possible.This tax can contribute to slowing down speculation, without penalizing the activities of the real economy, and making it possible to identify new resources for human investments and this as the UNDP assesses the necessary sum necessary to eradicate poverty, allow access to all to drinking water, satisfy health needs.While the debate is launched on a planetary scale on the capacity whether or not the policy of influencing the economic sphere, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political will to reconquer democratic spaces confiscated by international financial operators.And I would like to respond to the commissioner who said that it took a minimum number of industrial countries to achieve this.It seems to me that the European Union is made up of a large number of industrial countries and I believe, like Harlem Désir and several other stakeholders, that the European Union that we form can take the initiative in this regard.In any case, I believe that the European Parliament would be honored to echo the will of the citizens to master the world in the sense of well-being for all.Madam President, I too congratulate myself on the holding of this debate which was only too late.We know indeed that each generation, over time, has blindly paid in what one could call a dominant ideology, that is to say a set of prejudices accepted as they are by ambient conformism and which, however, end up revealing to the following generations how heavy they were heavy with dramas.Free trade and permanent beatification of globalization constitute, in our eyes, the dominant ideology of today, that is to say the great error of our end of the century, as dangerous as it was once the ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin, or, well before, the certainty erected in dogma that the land was flat.Our world is today dominated by a unique logic, I went to say a single God, that of money at work and not of man at work.With an amount of exchange of goods and services establishing 36,000 billion francs, that is to say the product of only four days of speculation, the financial bubble owes much to the productive activity of individuals.It self-suits in an escalation which continues to deny, everywhere, the humanity of man, that of the rich as much as that of the poor, even if it is the latter which, in the end, are excluded from most of the decision centers of the planet, which are monopolized by a tiny minority, which Jean-Pierre Chevènement was very well named: """	fr
"Nor can we allow it bravely treating Falun Gong supporters and dissidents. The EU should take advantage of all events in Geneva and elsewhere and express its unanimous dissatisfaction. Although I strongly support China to join the WTO, we should let China taste their own medicine. We should use these negotiations as a means of ensuring that China not only takes into account the EU's concerns about its ongoing human rights violations but also take action to improve the situation. Mr President, my good colleague so we can strengthen human rights in the Union, we must first take care of the weakest, mostly the poorest. The first of human rights violations is that not everyone is allowed to live a decent life. We have to take our guideline to respect a man, and this respect must be led to the fact that misery cannot destroy individuals and families that children are not deprived of their parents because of misery, and that simple freedom of association is not forbidden from those who do not even have the right to work. The aim is to create valid living conditions for all citizens. Everyone must be safe from poverty and exclusion. Everyone has the right to education, culture and health. Everyone has the right to a decent home and income that can live a respectable life. We have to assure us that we fight misery. We must assure that everyone is entitled to physical and mental integrity and that this immunity requires a valid life. Could the idea of ​​brotherhood become a key concept of the 21st century? Everyone needs to dream, and brotherhood now expresses our most important expectations of the poorest position. Brotherhood gives importance to solidarity by rejecting exclusion and loneliness and gives a place for respect for diversity. Brotherhood must be inspired by the rights of the poorest. Our centuries will become a century of progress, the century, during which even the wildest utopia is realized. The brotherhood belongs to these utopias, and together, my good colleague, we do it. Mr President, Mr Members of the Parliament, once again we own part of our plenary session time on a topic that is one of the noblest of our parliamentary work: for defending human rights, no matter where anywhere in the world, these rights are externally. I am happy about the successful decision of the Bureau to discuss at the same time about these four reports. Although it is true that no one has time to give them the attention they deserve, it is a fact that when we discuss human rights ""out there"" - elsewhere in the world - we have not omitted a serious analysis of what the ""inside"" here, in the European Union. Although it is true that, in the EU, we fortunately do not encounter rough insults that are fairly concerned about us in other states, it is equally true that in our Member States we also need to improve the respect of these rights - economic and social rights, civil rights and political rights;In particular, we need to pay attention to respect for private life and the protection of personal data, the rights of refugees in children, women and the country. We still have a lot to do in combating violence and racism and alien hatred in prisons. For third countries, it is essential and important for the European Union to have a common strategy that the Council prepares with the Parliament and should be consistently the same form as all the European Union policies, and the same form of development policy. It does not make sense that, in accordance with real politics, we demand more than others, or that we look at some states with more eyes than others, and that we continue to cooperate with states that do not respect the fundamental rights of people in which the principle of law does not work and where gross violations are not punished. If we still support politically and economically the countries where this is the case, we are criminal partners for governments that do not respect human rights and for which we can well question whether the community grants will be made to the people whose development we strive to promote or feed only the vanity, splendor and secret bank accounts of some of their leaders."	fi
"We would like to go further on a number of points.This is why we will vote for amendments 102, 103 and 104 proposed by the Green Group, and which seem to us to further improve our position on these questions.Regarding the policy relating to the price of water, it sometimes happens that extreme situations present themselves which require that there are exceptions in relation to the principles decreed in the report.For my part, I believe that the amendment 43 proposal of the Environment Commission provides for the necessary exceptional possibilities, and that the formulation on this subject is even more satisfactory in the amendment 105 proposal.I do not think useful to provide exceptions applicable to other cases than those indicated in these two proposals.But opinions on this subject are shared within our group.The amendment proposal 107, which relates to this question, has been accepted by a number of us.In a global way, I believe that the proposal of the Environment Commission, as it was submitted to us in the Lienemann report, is valid, and that it can constitute a good basis to achieve a difficult compromise.Mr. President, each photo taken by the satellites proves that we live well the blue planet: this abundance is however an illusion.The very recent disaster that has happened on the course of the Danube reminds us that rivers and rivers are the vital arteries of our planet and that pollution has no border.Water is a renewable and limited natural resource.It becomes scarce when it is not well managed and when the geographic and climatic conditions are not favorable.Within the Union, this question arises in crucial terms in the Mediterranean region, but also in other European countries where we are witnessing the progressive drying up of wetlands.Sensitive, humid or arid areas, inequalities between states, inequalities between the different regions within states, climatic, economic, geographic, geological particularities, are as obvious as we wish to recall, but which must not lead to distortions of competition in the community.However, we have filed amendments to recall the importance of the specific relationship of water agriculture, a capital factor in occupation and enhancement of the territory.It is understood that the needs of agriculture in the South are much superior and that this specificity must be taken into account in this framework directive.It is not only in the States of the Union that we are looking for solutions to these problems: the countries of the Euroméditerranean partnership in October in Turin, asked for the southern coast of the Mediterranean a Marshall plan on water.Fortunately, we are there.In Europe, there are however droughts, desertification in certain regions, but also floods, and the directive highlights it.We have suffered recently in France, and also in the Rhine valley and central Europe.We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which will have to make the different uses of water compatible.But it is necessary to integrate into this new management the protection and conservation of biodiversity.The ""Water"" file will not be closed today.Indeed, the question of enlargement and climatic developments open up new perspectives."	fr
The first concerns the timetable of these important restructuring. Mr Prodi said in a very important opening statement that he has perceived serious problems with the Commission on low morale and small motives, and this is clearly a major concern. High expectations have been supported by these restructuring, both within the Commission and outside. And if we want to move forward, I declare to you that the restructuring of staff, the early evidence of change of mindset, emancipation and incentives to staff must sooner or later happen. If we look at the initial proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in new proposals - we would only complete the overall reform of the service regulation in 2002. Indeed, only in 2001 some of the key evaluation elements were to be established. I find that the period is too long and we must actually move much shorter than this deadline. The second observation I want to make is about information technology. Have you really taken into account the changes that the new technology of information will bring about in the structure of staff? And this is because these changes will be fundamental to the new direction of these reforms. Concerning the second part of Mr Harbour's question, during this year he will find that we will show more accurately how the more extensive application of information technology will facilitate change, not only in the sense of the work and conditions of staff, but also in the operation of the Commission. Let me thank Mr. Harbor for the energetic dedication he is showing on the subject, to which he is a rapporteur, and to answer him by saying that we strongly believe that the morale, the motives and the professional dedication of the committee's employees, elements that are already very strong, will be enhanced bywith a number of other changes that we will implement. The mentality is a product of structures and systems, and structures and systems are now old. Refreshing these structures and systems, in some cases very drastically, we will help the people of the Commission, who are very dedicated to the European ideal and have high quality skills, to highlight their gifts and present a different person from the person. I would like to make a last observation in response to Mr Harbor. I share his impatience to ensure the complete implementation of restructuring and changing practices. I wish I could honestly tell him that we would develop and provide announcements in the form of 2001 announcements and that we will definitely implement them before 2002, but will know that the legal views and times of consultation are required to respect. I do not use them as an excuse. Indeed, we are taking a huge courage from the very positive and constructive response that was consulted last month and I therefore believe that, although there may be a slight delay in the preparation and implementation of restructuring, but these restructuring will be reinforced by the extent of its extent.	el
We need more police forces;The available forces are absolutely insufficient.We need independent justice - which will certainly be difficult to set up - as well as funds for the High Commission for Human Rights.All this must be done, and quickly.If we do not quickly bring our aid, the situation will deteriorate and it could result from new conflicts and crisis situations.This is why I think we have done well to act quickly, accept the urgency and release funds.Only, we want to see the acts and successes won in Kosovo and I pray to the Commission to ensure the good implementation of these resources, in particular with regard to the development of the police and the implementation of justice.Mr. President, I first thank the deputies, and in particular the rapporteur, for the promptness with which they dealt with this subject.This will undoubtedly allow us to quickly pay help and to face the concerns of which Mr. Swoboda as well as Ms. Pack told us.It seems to me that three types of fundamental concern emerge from this evening debate.First, although we have progressed a lot in this regard, we could cite the customs administration, the banking administration, the tax administration, it is true that we still have a way to go.To finance what?This is the first point where there is a certain divergence.In one of your amendments, you suggest establishing more limited the kind of institutions to which the Union financing contribution.For example, amendments 3 and 5. Nevertheless, in our eyes, we should allow, in both cases, a greater margin of handle at the United Nations administration which knows the situation on the ground than us better.We believe that predetermining the destination of resources at the moment would create additional practical difficulties.Ultimately, we will have to trust those who, in the field, can make certain decisions better than we do.The second concern, which some of you share, it seems to me, it is Mr. Bourlanges who expressed it first, but others also expressed it concerns the problem of other donors.Does the commission make an excessive effort when others do not put their cooperation in work?Some amendments in your report go in this direction.Amendments 1, 2 and 4, for example.I would tell Mr. Bourlanges and those who raised this point that the fundamental problem does not reside in the mind, which we are completely sharing.The fundamental problem is that it is true that the distribution of the effort between the various donors is currently based on the declarations of the High Level Steering Group, but it is no less true that they have no legal value, they constitute only a political commitment.This is why we would ask, we have also provided a note to Mr. Brok in this direction, that amendment 1, whose spirit we accept, is written otherwise, so that it does not suppose conditionality to the supply of community resources.	fr
President!Dear rapporteurs!Ladies and gentlemen!I would first like to thank the rapporteurs who have managed to create well -founded reports in a short time.Regardless of this, my faction criticized the schedule of the work of the committee.The reports were presented late, and the treatment was also carried out with great hurry at least in the committee of regional policy, transport and tourism.This gave good chances to discuss the results of earlier programs, good practices as well as defects.In connection with the Interreg program, our faction would like to emphasize cross -border activities, in particular the cooperation that goes beyond the external borders of the Union.Important regions areThe Balkans and the Adriatic, in my opinion it should not forget the cooperation with Russia.My faction therefore once again points out the problem of practical control of the funds and emphasizes the need for better coordination of the Interreg, Tacis, ISPA and Pharse programs.There is still a lack of this, and the Commission has not yet submitted any specific suggestions to improve coordination.Parliament expects the Commission to present our committee as quickly as possible.In the practical implementation, the inclusion of companies, organizations and other players is of crucial importance.The cooperation projects require better planning, more precise control and more result -oriented implementation based on the experience already gained.The projects often got stuck, their efficiency failed due to the administration and bureaucracy.We also have to demand a binding commitment to the projects and the fulfillment of their share from our cooperation partners.Our faction renews some amendments that were rejected during the treatment in the committee.I also go into the Urban report, when the rapporteur's rapporteur is thankfully appealing to the minimum amount of 500 euros per inhabitant in the guidelines of the Commission.This cannot work as a generalized goal.Rather, this amount must be able to be determined in accordance with the conditions in the respective target area.This aspect is of such importance that it should appear in the conclusions instead of the justifications.Mr. President, dear colleagues!Interreg is one of the most European of all structural funds.Projects should not only be promoted in a region, in a country, but in neighboring regions in two or more countries.Unfortunately, this only applies to part of the money, namely only to the limits within the EU.But the regions at the borders to third countries need a functioning instrument for cross -border cooperation.The regulation is deceptive as if it were.But it's not like that.It is the case that the Commission has not changed the regulation for years, although Parliament has been demanding this for a long time.In practical terms, this means for the next time for these regions that it will be degraded into a deteriorated zone edge promotion.Parliament has called for a common fund for cooperation with the third countries to reduce the difficulties for working with the third countries.Nothing happened!The difficulties are delayed again at the expense of the affected regions.The parliament again calls for an improvement and cross -border cooperation, and we expect that a common fund will be formed and that the regulation will be changed again in cooperation with the other commissioners.	de
"Based on our experience, this would give the signals more credibility. Where this system has been applied it works perfectly. For this reason we are very pleased with the fact that the idea of ​​an organization with more commercial orientation has been abandoned. I also find it positive that the idea of ​​rating the ecological signal was rejected. It is easier to have only one flower. A rating system that would be in force from the beginning would probably create more problems with the information it would provide. We are pleased with the fact that the proposal will also include the public sector. Overall, we consider that the common position and proposals of an amendment submitted, including the proposals for amendment to the Confederate Group of the European Union Left - Left of the Northern Greens of the Northern Countries, make this report very good. Mr President, I recently noticed a bottle of ""environmentally friendly"" wet detergent in my bride's house. When I congratulated her, so she appeared to feel a bit guilty and admitted that there was now a normal detergent in the green bottle, because the alternative product not only cost more expensive, but also needed to use four times as much, and even then the dishes were not well cleaned. By refilling the bottle, it could be effectively washing and impressing her friends who were in favor of the environment. The moral lesson of this story is that ecological products, in order to be competitive in the modern market, must have almost the same performance as the products they replace. Only then can they get out of the commercial ""corner"" they already hold on the market and conquer the general public. The ecological signal should not be related to moderation. The German ""Blue Angel"" and the Norwegian ""Swan"" paved the way for ecological marking. If one rejected these successful systems today, they would burn near the dry and green. I can see the benefits of the single European ecological signal in the long run, but this should not be imposed on those who already have such systems. A single system has advantages for businesses, e.g. Only one application fee, a check, standard packaging, but also for consumers, who will not be confused by a plethora of signals. The awarding of the ecological signal is extended by forest products and detergents to computers and home appliances. But why stop there? It could extend to services such as tourism and net taxes. In addition, groups of similar small businesses could probably work together and registered together. In the United Kingdom we have a flourishing financial sector that offers savings and pensions from investments based on an environmental perspective. These services should not only meet the criteria for the ecological signal, but they should also be allowed to sell their products without obstacles throughout the European Union in a single financial services market. Sv) Mr President, Honorable Members, I first would of course express my gratitude to the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, especially to the two rapporteurs. Schnellhardt and Poggiolini, for the very constructive work done during the revision of the Ecological Badge Regulation."	el
The reproach is not new.Since Europe has been trying to do something in terms of development cooperation, efficiency and quality of this assistance have been disputed.Hope for improvement is threatened with disappearance if the committee continues to refuse to look in a mirror.Why was the critical report on the consistency of the development cooperation policy was not disseminated outside?One of the essential conclusions of this report concerned the internal contradictions of European policy.In the agriculture and trade sector in particular, European policy is in contradiction with development cooperation policy.We do not manage to provide serious help in the development of the least developed countries.This is due to the differences in points of view between different countries of the European Union with regard to development cooperation.We no longer have to consider development cooperation as an instrument of foreign affairs or external relations, but rather as an autonomous political field.I plead in favor of a policy of cooperation in transparent, united and efficient development.As long as the European approach to the problem of development cooperation remains a cause of ineffectiveness and waste of money, it is preferable that this role is devolved to the Member States.Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to transmit as soon as possible in Parliament the document I have spoken of, so that we can think positively about the solutions that it would be possible to provide.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I think this initiative is a relevant and completely supposed initiative.As many colleagues have already said it before me, we often see very contradictory situations between what we claim to do with the development and cooperation policy, on the one hand, and what we defeat, on the other hand, with other sectoral policies whose interests are contrary in terms of development of these same countries.We are not only talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fishing and industry.We are generally talking, what is more serious, of contradictions between our economic and commercial policies, on the one hand, and our defense policies, on the other hand.Finally, there is a set of contradictory situations.In my opinion, contradictions are not so serious in terms of community policies;They are more serious with regard to certain objectives and certain industries of a few Member States.We must be aware of it.On the one hand, we often adopt resolutions on the peace processes in other parts of the world, as we have done very recently in the case of Indonesia, a case to lift the embers in heaven, and then we note, on the other hand, that certain European countries supplied this country with arms and war material.This is in my opinion what are the most serious contradictions in this area, more serious than the contradictions of a certain incompatibility of sectoral policies, which of course exists.It is obvious that there are always contradictions between the different policies, even in a given country.It's normal.At the European Union level, we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various common policies, in this case in the development policy.We must be aware that these contradictions exist and that it is necessary to minimize them, this objective of minimizing contradictions being a fair and wise objective, at the base of the presentation of this resolution.	fr
We strongly support the principle itself, but we believe that it can be more effectively monitored if Member States still have the authority to introduce the debit systems suitable for their own circumstances. For example, the United Kingdom system, where the ship pays the waste to the collector whenever it uses waste management services without interfering with the port, works well. It is based on the agreement between all actors, including ports and environmental organizations, such as the RSPB and the World Natural Foundation. However, we believe, like a rapporteur, that various charging systems must not increase the risk of pollution of the sea. For this reason, we support the Council's proposal to confirm the review clause in order to regularly monitor the effectiveness of the Directive. The Mr President, the one who has seen the consequences of the ERIKA tanker's disaster has been for the environment, cannot be opposed to the name of reasonableness, the aim of which is to ensure oil remaining. This is a very important report. In this context, it should be emphasized that this is not primarily about the lack of legislation. All EU countries have signed the so-called MARPOL Convention, and the States of the Baltic Sea have also signed the Helsinki Convention. The purpose of both is to avoid emissions in the sea. On the other hand, it is about improving the availability of waste reception services and that we also encourage them to use. Every year, there are quite a few oil -free emissions in the Baltic Sea, the extent of which varies greatly;Already in Swedish regional waters, it is hundreds of cases a year. From an environmental point of view, the Baltic Sea is also significantly more sensitive to many other seas. From this point of view, we will consider today's decision to the beginning of a solution that eventually all the states of the Baltic Sea, including the candidate states Poland, Latvia and Lithuania. In my opinion, it is a matter where cross -border cooperation can only be useful. We will never be able to solve Europe's environmental problems alone. Finally, I would like to say to those who, for financial reasons, still have a suspicion: on the other hand, think about the cost of cleaning our sea! There is still a time when such requirements are topical. Then we are grateful if we have done everything we can do to prevent oil emissions. Mr President, first I want to say at first that hardly anyone suspects the need for a directive on this problem, as this is a serious problem not only for Europe but also for all seas of the world and therefore requires effective and urgent measures. I would like to make it clear that there are certain principles that are universal and therefore we completely agree with. First, all ports must have the necessary waste treatment equipment. Secondly, of course the pollutant pays. I agree that there may be differences in exceptions to vessel types or ships. However, it must not happen that we start a war that eventually distort competition between different ports, or that in theory, the environmental protection measures will eventually distort competition between different ports. Therefore, at this stage, we need to take effective action, because unless we are able to find a suitable solution, this directive will lead to complete failure. In this case, it only benefits some ports at the expense of others, as environmental jewelery jewelery hides the competition war between the ports. For example, it would be consistent to introduce a cohesive tariff in all ports of Europe, exactly the same amount of tariff that would not lead to any distortion of competition, or similar measures. All decisions that allow, for example, the aid granted by Member States to ports, eventually distort competition and are ineffective. Mr President, like a member of the Parliament, I am interested in sea and diving, as well as sailing, and I really believe that all of us attendees are interested in how we can ensure the purity of the seas for current and future generations. I think the work we are dealing with today is a great step forward.	fi
"Yes, the products are free from these areas, the products produced in the Israeli settlements occupied. We have an international agreement and is violated. It is our duty to ensure that everyone complies with and maintain the terms of the contract. In these circumstances, when Israel does not clearly fulfill his duties and apply the provisions of the agreement or the regional expression as it should, the Commission encourages Member States to use the import procedure, which may be prolonged and avoidable. The Israeli Customs Customs may have a lot of time, up to 10 months, provides answers to inquiries, and the import procedure can be completely ineffective. We should claim a collateral for all products imported from Israel before we can make sure that Israel will stop breaking the contract. I have a few questions, a member of the Commission. Has the Commission received documents identified by any Member State Customs Board of Israel Customs, where certain settlements in the occupied areas are presented as part of the scope of this Agreement? Has it directly asked Israeli officials whether its customs institution applies the regional expression of the contract to exclude the occupied areas from the contract, and has it made Israel understand and interpret the regional expression correctly? And is the Commission aware of whether they apply the regional expression correctly or not? Finally, the Commission has already said that acting to maintain international agreements with the EU, and I quote directly, ""is not a penalty for Israel, but it requires the correct implementation of both voluntary contracts.""In short, a member of the Commission, this is not something that should be considered the subject of a political debate on the peace process. It is actually an international agreement and a trade agreement. Finally, I would like to express my great wishes about the peace process in that area - in the world crap that needs it so desperately - and that it could solve its problems and help millions of poor and bad citizens. Mr President, my good colleague, is clear that the rules must be followed. It is equally clear that our partner must make them follow them. Everyone understands that we are now concerned about this, but I wish our demand would not be considered one -sided. I would also wish that our oral question would not be considered blame. As our requirements are not one -sided, the Commission must also be willing to use community funds in the neighboring Israeli areas. And since the Commission's requirement is not a reproach and must not be considered as such, I want to remind me of two things that are central to our approach. First of all, everyone who knows the area knows that the future of the Palestinian economy depends significantly on the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo minutes refer to the common customs area formed by the Israeli and the Palestinian Autonomous Authority. And the cooperation between Israel and Palestine would be seriously hampered by everything that aims to distinguish between these two households, the Palestinian subcontractors and the Palestinian exporters. Secondly, the boundaries of the State of Israel are not defined in any agreement between the Israeli and the European Union. Defining these boundaries is specifically a challenge between the Israeli and the Palestinian Autonomous Authority. All attempts by the European Union to drive their own views on the Israeli region would at least demonstrate harmful pace on these negotiations and the idea that we have to play in Europe in this area. I am in favor of a cautious approach that a member of the Commission has taken and taken here, firstly because it is not simple. It is complicated because it is always difficult to determine the origin of the products and where they come from. It is not any easier in the Middle East, because the situation is such that Israel and Palestinians have many joint projects where the products are in some cases partly made into the Palestinian and Israeli state. This development is a good thing, and it knows good in the future, because if trading in this way in the Middle East, it will be the basis for any kind of peace treaty."	fi
I am willing to do so - you know this from me, and I am really willing to do so at any time it is necessary. Just at the moment, I would like to share an important thing with you. The Helsinki Summit was in December, and the prime ministers and leaders of our states asked us to do something very important for the first time. To have the potential and to seek to manage crisis even at the military level. I proudly declare that two months after Helsinki we have launched the process and move in the right direction. I believe that Parliament MPs, as representatives of our citizens, will be proud of it.(Applause) (in) I express my great gratitude for the opportunity I have to intervene in the debate on the statement of the senior representative. I will not be very busy with parliament, however, I could refer to one or two points, and begin by drawing attention to the relationship between rhetoric and reality, which is sometimes dangerous to any parliament. Mrs Pack did it in her observations and in her intervention in general, and is prepared to chart a course that I believe that others should have the courage to follow. I would just like to say a few words about this particular subject. Last week I spoke at an extremely interesting meeting organized among members of the NATO parliamentary delegation and European Parliament MPs. Many of you were present at this event and I believe it is fair to say that you could have uprooted the skepticism of many NATO parliamentary representatives when we talked about Europe's ambitions in the KEPPA sector. This was mainly true for some American representatives who attended, but also for one or two of the others. As I pointed out, when I was talking to some of them, I felt that they did not know if they had to laugh or cry, and this reminds us of all the trials we have put on ourselves, as well as the trials in which we need to respond in the coming months and years. In this context, the observations of the senior representative were extremely encouraging today. We have accomplished many things in a very short time, but we still have to cover a very long distance, and for the coming months and years we will deal with difficult issues, e.g. Those related to resources. Many will argue that, of course, what Europe needs is to better use existing resources. But I suspect that there will be a greater debate in our own countries, in the Member States, whether these resources are actually sufficient, whether they will secure the type of security policy for which we want our Union to have more responsibility. I would just like to say a few words about the non -military aspects of our security policy, the prevention of conflict and crisis management. Quite rightly, we focused on the military side today, but we have not forgotten the non -military side. Mozambique reminds us how important it is to remember it.	el
Is it true that the US government opposes most of the provisions of the existing project and threatens to even turn to the World Trade Organization (violation of Article 2 (2) of the Agreement of the Trade Technical Obstacles) if the Directive is approved? The Commission agrees with the members of the Parliament that the current treatment of waste from electrical equipment and electronic devices in the European Union will cause significant environmental problems. The Commission has therefore decided to draw up a proposal related to this issue and has been dealing with all the parties since 1997. The Commission is now looking at the results of this debate and the thorough studies that are being carried out today. Certain parts of the proposal have been criticized, including the gradual reduction of certain heavy metals and bromine -containing fire retardants and the application of the principle that the manufacturer is responsible for the treatment of waste caused by electrical and electronic devices. The US European Union delegation has been cautious about some of the last negotiations, including the gradual reduction of the use of the above substances and certain issues related to the principles of the manufacturer's responsibility. The main reason of the US in this context is that these provisions are alleged to contradict international trade law. The Commission is currently weighing the reasons for the delegation. Allow me to add that my plans are to submit a proposal to the Commission before the Easter Commission on the treatment of waste from electrical equipment and electronic devices. My question was about the US government's reaction to the text of the preliminary proposal. In fact, there were three versions of the preliminary proposal, and the last one was given in July 1999. So are you going to introduce that recent text or some change made into the original version? The third version was already weaker than the second version due to remarks made by the US government. I note, among other things, that when you talk about an international right with which the text is not compatible, you actually refer to the rules of the world trade organization. The US government's claims are apparently related to the ultimate ban on the urgent ban on WTO rules. I am concerned about this, because this means that if we accept a text, we are constantly threatened by the world's trade organization, and this makes the Union's environmental legislation completely unstable, which, in particular, will undermine this proposal. Thanks for the additional question. It is important that I get the opportunity to answer it. It is clear that we have a continuous dialogue with different parties in a process of a very large amount of waste from electrical equipment and electronic equipment in Europe. We have been a rewarding dialogue and have made a proposal during the process. Certain parts have been reinforced, with other parts we have had to make a little too much compromise. The writing of the text is still ongoing and the dialogue between different parties is running until the last minutes. I want to say that I do not have to let the United States get involved in this question to lead us to not pay enough attention to environmental aspects. Indeed, I oppose that the EU can be prevented from developing radical environmental rules by constantly invoking the WTO and trade rules. My starting point is that they have to be drawn up. However, I am ready to listen to all the reasoning. Recently, for example, I met representatives of the electronics industry. They made suggestions - even practical - how we could improve our proposal. However, I definitely want to counteract the claim that I would allow the United States to guide the formatting of our directive. I really think that we have to act as pioneers, which is also illustrating for the final proposal. Question 42 (H-0026/00): Subject: Gender and the Environment of all individual organizations, NGOs, Governments, UN and relief organizations that participated in the Rio and Kyoto process, women should have a greater contribution to environmental decision-making.	fi
"You mentioned the Council in this context. We therefore need to overcome this problem. However, I do not believe the solution to the problem is that the new Greenland agreement will pay license fees for fishing quotas and the problem will be resolved in this way. It's not the solution to the problem. There must be a difference. Sharing unused quotas and mechanism for it: Yes! However, we should not introduce license fees where we do not have to pay for quotas. It is not very sensible for us. Question No 51 (H-0195/00): Subject: Compatibility of Special Excavation Support with Community law with the destruction of Western Europe in December 1999 is a very critical situation. As the collection of fallen trees has to be urgently taken, the French government has decided, among other things, to grant a tonne of 50 FRFs per tonne of timber to the other Member States of the Union. The competition rules of the community, and especially the obligation to favor the community, are fully prohibited by such aids, except when they are intended to remedy the exceptional situation. Thus, Article 92 (2) (b) of the EC Construction Agreement provides: ""The joint market is suitable for: [...] support to compensate for the damage caused by natural disasters or other exceptional events.""Are the export subsidies planned by the French government in accordance with Article 92? If they are, can such subsidies be extended to exporting forestry sector to non -EU countries? If so, what criteria the Commission will use to determine, what amounts can be granted, how long and at what cost? Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, French authorities, have requested the Commission a few days ago to deal with state subsidies, which France wants to grant to remedy the storms of December last year for his forestry forestry. The announcement of the French authorities plan a measure to facilitate the removal of wood from damage to damage. However, there is no mention of the destination of the wood and in particular whether it is intended to be exported to other Member States or third countries. The Commission has therefore logically asked for more information from the French authorities. As the Commission does not yet have all these additional information available, it will not be able to take a stand on the compatibility of such actions today with the Community law today. I would like to ask a Commission member to refine their answer. It is clear that the Member States of the Community have already officially appointed this aid. Rather, it is from outside the community, and it can be presented as follows: Is it possible for us to get a tonnage, cost and time exception to exported wood, given the completely exceptional nature of this storm? Of course, my question concerned exports outside the joint market, the Union. In order for this matter here: according to Community law, wood is an industrial product, and export support is not logically allowed in the export of wood under any circumstances in the form of, for example, agriculture. In this respect, we can only apply existing community rights. Article 87 of the Community law in force provides that damage - notice damage - directly related to the disaster may be compensated. This means that the damage must first exist and secondly, a direct connection between the disaster and the damage resulted from. You also need to consider the following: If we were in favor of such an idea - the price of wood has not only fallen in French forestry, but has fallen as a result of the disaster as a whole - every Member State could come to say that we want the approval of the Commission for export support. It would mean a clear distortion of the market. Question 52 (H-0202/00): Subject: Wine Profit-Increasing quotas The Commission has given permission for a 10 million hectolitre league for wine year 1999-2000."	fi
Social, economic and cultural phenomenon, tourism concerns the majority of European citizens, whether as beneficiaries or as very diverse service providers.Each year it is nearly 200 million Europeans who leave their usual place of residence for a time in order to do tourism, most often in other European countries.In addition, Europe remains the main tourist destination of third countries, even if it has to face increasingly strong competition and an increasingly diverse and attractive offer.As soon as the treaties do not provide for a specific legal basis for the implementation of a real community tourism policy, the European Union must help improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, while respecting the principle of subsidiarity, in order to concretize the potential that tourism offers in terms of employment.Vocational training, the mobility of the workforce represents essential instruments of an unemployment control strategy in Europe, in particular, with regard to tourist service providers, in order to meet the multicultural demands of demand and in order to provide appropriate customer services.Tourism employment is, often, highly seasonal and precarious, which is an obstacle to its sustainable development.It is therefore all the more urgent to acquire and disseminate know-how in terms of management and technology in order to promote new production methods and to promote a tourist offer that best meets market development.The adoption by the Member States of tax measures favorable to SMEs in order to reduce, in particular, the charges that weigh on the work factor would, as the report indicates, an excellent way to promote employment growth, in sectors with a high intensity of workforce and, therefore, in the tourism sector.This field of activity is also a decisive element of the economic and social development of the least favored regions: I am thinking in particular of the ultraperipheral and island regions, whose assets in the matter are not questionable.Let us not forget that, in these UlTraperipheral regions, tourism represents the first industry in terms of revenue.The revenue and employment induced by tourism contribute to a large extent to reduce imbalances and encourage a convergence of their economies to the average rate of community development.In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it allows greater awareness of different European cultures and thus contributes to the development of respect for European lifestyles.It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed wisely, in the long term, must represent for local economies a source of sustainable income while safeguarding and valuing landscape, cultural, historical and environmental wealth.Finally, I would like to emphasize the primary role that the European Union should play in favor of new tourism forms, in new places: I think precisely and in particular to introduce Europeans, continental, the most distant European destinations, the Ultraperic regions.Mr. President, we have launched a great debate on very little because, ultimately, the basic document is nothing more than a communication from the commission which follows the conclusions and the recommendations of a high -level group on tourism and employment.Not only is a question of little but, in addition, the document we are talking about is a bit old, since it is dated April 28, 1999, that is to say almost a year ago.	fr
We also consider the conclusions contained in this document. We also consider it to be delightful the sketching speech that the Commission chairman, Prodi, just liked. The conclusions of the document states that the five -year period of the Prod -led Commission will be a time of major change. Europe is progressing in integration, and at the same time, the Union begins the expansion phase, which will eventually lead to our continent reunification. This is challenging, ambitious, could even say the prophetic. Mr President of the Commission, we hope this will succeed. However, we also find that the present is the foundation of the future, and we can only form the future if we survive the tests of the present. I say this seriously and say this worried! Thus, I appeal to the current debate that is held in the European Union at the moment of conflicts. We in the European Union are a community! We belong together even though we have problems. Now is not the right time to isolate, but to combine and make this European integration work together! Mr President of the Commission, you have supported and re -defended the European Parliament in recent weeks. You have understood yourself as a security guard - what your role is. We therefore demonstrate special respect, recognition and support towards you, including the letter to the Austrian Republic of Austria to the Federal Chancellor.(Applause) Mr President of the Commission, we agree with you about the target setting: we want a strong, functional and democratic Europe in the 2000s. Europe that defends its values ​​of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law, both inside and out, while at the same time pursues its interests in the world with dignity, patiently and convincingly self -conscious. As the message of the European and the European Union, the world must not be arrogant and, in particular, European nationalism, but its message must be cooperation, partnership and peaceful development. Globalization thus means the opportunity to formulate this increasingly compacting world in peaceful competition and solidarity. In this way, globalization is more of an opportunity than a danger, more merger than segregation, more mutual enrichment than restriction. However, we also know that we can shape these major challenges of globalization only in one European. Globalization is not only an economic process but also a cultural process. We say that we want a partnership in the world and, as many predicts - - cultural clashes and collision of civilizations, but we want partnership, encounter, exchange and peace. However, we also say that we want to defend this European society of tolerance, and therefore a common foreign, safety and defense policy is so significant. Negotiations with six Central Europe states begin today. Thus, the European family will condense another step. We consider it correct what you said about the Barcelona process: all countries in the Mediterranean must recognize the dignity, democracy and the rule of law. For us, the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democratic Group of the European Democrats are not important for the next five years to reform the institutions of the European Union, but also to committed to its common European currency and that stability policy must form the basis for stabilizing European currency over the next few years. We therefore definitely believe that the stability agreement must be concluded and must be followed consistently! We need restructuring in the European economy. Above all, we need a European economy where work is worthwhile again when people become entrepreneurs. It would be fatal for Europe if there were only few multinational companies left and small and medium -sized companies in Europe would have any future opportunities!(Applause) This Commission plays an important role in which we - in cooperation with nation states - bring tax reducing policy to support entrepreneurship again. In this respect, we want to start Europe together. You have talked about the decentralization and the principle of subsidiarity in your statement.	fi
I would like to request what new initiatives can take the advice to preserve the interests of these farmers in the next world trade negotiations, in particular in the face of large-scale and industrial style production of the United States and New Zealand, where economies of scale make it extremely difficult for European family farms to remain competitive and where, of course, European food security standards do not apply.I fully understand the concerns of the deputy and I can see that we need an effort and a certain coherence including within the European Union with regard to this matter.It is also necessary to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensation for farmers.However, as you know, this question depends on the European Commission, which will have to develop it.The council has a limited intervention capacity in this area.Mr. President, allow me to congratulate me on the presence of the president in office in this enclosure.However, I do not think he answered my question which specifically concerns the treatment of the problem of the homeless and the accommodation.I also asked if the Portuguese presidency planned to meet non -governmental organizations actively engaged in this area.I appreciate and make mine without reservation on the need for multiple policies and a multidisciplinary approach, as well as on the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion, which can cause homelessness, not to mention drug addiction.My question concerns the homeless more precisely.It is to know if a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties to which the President in office alluded to the intergovernmental aid.I have the feeling that Europe can play a very active role in this regard, if only using forum where the Member States can exchange their experiences and the practices that seem to give the best results.Mr. MP, with regard to the possibility for the presidency to support the actions of non-governmental organizations, in particular in the specific case of the fight against the problems of the homeless, I would like to say that this type of initiatives is welcome and we can no longer open to any possibility of supporting them.We have collaborated with Portuguese non-governmental organizations and with some of their initiatives presented in the action of the Portuguese presidency, which we connect to all the concerns underlying our own program.We have no concrete specific initiative in the matter, we are therefore not closed to the hypothesis of an initiative of non -governmental organizations which would be offered to us in this area during our presidency.Initiative which must be part of the capacity of the council.But it must be understood that everything that could affect the right of initiative of the Commission will of course go through the Commission itself.Mr. President in office, you have told us a lot about the future: what the Commission will do, what the presidency will do in Lisbon, etc.And you made us an announcement that terrifies me, Mr. President.	fr
"In the Presidential State document, on the last page, I found the intention to set up an industrial change monitoring center. In my opinion, such a follow -up center could play an important role and I would like to ask for an effective focus on this issue, and I would like to ask for the Unice, the European Communities' Industry Association in particular, to bring a little more commitment and enthusiasm for this. I have been bothered that in its documents for this summit, it is particularly presenting the wish lists of the activities of the authorities, but does not emphasize its own commitments and role as a whole. I think - whatever it was - it should cooperate in these activities. Another thing I would like to mention briefly is tax coordination because I think I don't have time to deal with three things. The Presidential State mentions the difficulty of corporate taxation and indicates that the Mont's package has a significant dead end. I would like to ask, above all, from the Commission, an extensive analysis of the development of corporate taxation and I would like to suggest to Member States that they would consider a kind of Luxembourg process, because when I look at the story, I also see specifically examples of the best usable practices. So I ask you to pay attention to this issue as well. Mr President, the Mr President of the Council, the Mr Commission chairman, many things have already been said, so if you speak last, there is a risk that you will repeat things. However, I would really like to thank the Portugal Presidential State for the document presented and for the convincing speech given by the chairman of the Council. As President Guterres recalled, it is true that Lisbon is not intended to start new processes, but to bring the processes of Luxembourg, Cardiff and Cologne. However, for the first time after years, we set a strategic goal for ourselves, and I think this is very important: the purpose is to make the Union an economic area based on innovation and knowledge to increase economic growth and to achieve high quality full employment and social cohesion. Last year, the Commission had conducted a study stating that if there is no thorough address in qualifications and vocational training issues, in 2010, in 2010, 80 % of the current employment will be outdated, which will deepen existing inequality and bring about new ones: there is a need for continuous training and significant investment in knowledge and knowledge. It is also necessary to increase research, another strategic field in the Member States, in Europe;It is imperative to take a great leap to increase quality significantly, moving from framework programs to the European research area, a common research policy. And innovation should not only be structural, technological, but must also be achieved in procedures and measures. As the colleague van Lancker has already said, the ""Social Affairs"" Council must have the same meaning as the Ecofin Council. In addition, social dialogue must be strengthened in such a way that it is a primary tool for the necessary changes. Lisbon should not only be remembered for his excellent preparatory document, but as a summit that at the beginning of the new millennium begins a new meaning in European development, employment and social cohesion. Mr President of the Council, I would like to congratulate you on getting Europe unanimous that modernization of the economy and social cohesion are concepts that can be coordinated. Preparations for the Lisbon Summit provide evidence that there is not enough work in Europe and that if we want to be the most dynamic region in the world, we must also have more information and the ability to use it. In order to raise the employment rate and finance social security systems, we need to work longer from our lives and, above all, we need to get more and better educated women in working life. So we hope the Lisbon Summit will contribute to changing the current women's employment model. I would like to ask you, the chairmen, do you believe that this summit will be made on conclusions that can be used to take concrete and timely defined measures so that women have a greater part not only in working life, but above all in a new knowledge -based economy?"	fi
Finally, I would like to point out the question of liability.Not only with regard to the maximum amounts that, in my opinion, the North American must be similar.We have set $ 180 million;In the United States, one speaks of one billion dollars as an upper limit for compensation.I believe that we have to increase the current amount and approach a level that is similar to that of the United States, but that we also have to rethink the amount of insurance and thus the liability of the shipowner and involve those liability those who charter the ships, the owners of the freight.As long as one does not require the responsibility of the freight owners, the problems will not be finally regulated in my opinion.I come to the end, I don't want to go further.We will have the opportunity to do this.However, as a speaker said - and I thank everyone for their absolutely constructive and apt contributions - we must not allow us to say again in one or three years in two or three years that we would not have done what we should have done.On my part, I can say that after I have discussed this in the college of the Commissioners that the Commission is ready to present the legislative measures, the changes and the guidelines that are necessary to provide us with the highest possible security standards.The political will of this parliament - and I find that I can count on it - and that of the Council of Ministers.Thank you.Mrs. Commissioner.We have taken note of your willingness.According to Article 37, Paragraph 2, I received eight decision -making applications to conclude this declaration from the Commission.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday at 12 p.m.Storms in Europe According to the agenda, the Commission's explanation of the storms in Europe follows.The word has the word on behalf of the Commission.Mr. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for your words, especially for the very concrete suggestions for the victims who expect a lot from the European Union.Personally, a few days after this terrible storm, I asked you to request an adaptation of the Ziel2 areas from the French authorities so that all regions damaged by the storm are eligible in France and in other countries under target 2.I think that has happened because they didn't say anything about it.We all know that if you do not meet the criteria of goal 2, you have the greatest difficulty to get help.So it is better to help this problem immediately.They also know that this problem not only faces itself in the short term, but also means and long -term.Let me explain that.I was in Lorraine when this terrible storm destroyed about 20 % of the deciduous forest.Damage of 20 % means an enormous loss for some forestry communities.For example, we know that a tree is only fully grown after 150 to 200 years.The loss for these communities will therefore not extend over one, two or five years, but over a much longer period.	de
"Excessive formal procedures. Is there any reference to a reduction in formal procedures and bureaucracy regarding those who apply for European funding, while ensuring fiscal control? This is a clear complaint that we receive and needs to be treated. The other question I would like to ask concerns the audit monitoring committee. This is certainly welcome, but it is fundamental to include a report on the monitoring of the recommendations made by the European Parliament in the context of the exemption process. Will you add this to the duties of the audit monitoring committee? Finally, the Socialist group agrees with the drafting of the budget based on activities and with ""responsibility"", and, as Mr Prodi states, you will be judged by the actions and not by your words. The task of reconnecting with European citizens is crucial, as Ms Morgan says, and can only be achieved on the basis of works and not words. I say this with some respect for the European Parliament, where there are so many skilled pilots of speech, but we will try to set the example. In terms of excessive formal processes, Mrs Morgan made the dilemma clear. We hate excessive formal procedures, but given the requirements for control, re -check and double control, in order to ensure an effective budgetary control, sometimes the demands of the administration, which some call bureaucracy, are inevitable. However, in order to reduce these obligations to a minimum, we are not simply talking about them, in the near future we will appoint a Deputy Secretary -General, an additional Deputy Secretary -General, with the specific mandate and mission to determine optimal practices and to disseminate them throughoutWell, so much frustration, not only to the citizens and businesses of the Union, but also to the people who work for the committee. We will certainly fight to do so, and I think the result will start to become apparent in the coming years. One of our difficulties will always be the fact that the better we are in restructuring, the less one will know about it. Therefore, we rely on our friends and partners in the European Parliament to explain with their usual greatness the comprehensive efforts made by the Commission to properly serve Europe's citizens. I know that I can rely on all of you here. The discussion on this issue ended. I thank President Mr. Prodi, as well as Commissioner Kinnock. A statement by the Supreme Representative on Common Foreign Affairs and Security Policy The agenda provides the statement by the Supreme Representative on Common Foreign and Security Policy. I warmly welcome Mr. Javier Solana and give him the floor immediately. I would like to thank Mr. Solana and give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the team of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats. Thanks, Mr. Poettering. Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Patten Commissioner's intervention in this debate is absolutely deliberate. We agreed to give him the floor whenever he asked for him."	el
Personally, I have been involved in the South African Committee for the exploration of truth and reconciliation for many years and it was shocking to see how a nation, who was experiencing difficult situations, was geared towards a more open, European -style, pluralistic democratic society. I am very afraid that we are, on the other hand, we are oriented towards European isolation and European apartheid. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Mr President of the Council, I think the question that must be asked in Geneva this year is certainly not that of the death penalty. We have already submitted three resolutions to Geneva for approval on the death penalty. We have failed at the General Assembly last year, due to a hypocritical prudence, due to Article 2.7, which we also accept quietly in all other texts. Therefore, the issue of the death penalty must be raised at this year's General Assembly and certainly not at the Geneva Summit. The crucial issue, Mr. Patten said and thank him for the positions he supported, is the issue of China. Unfortunately, the positions of the Commission and the Council, or in any case of the Presidency, are separated by more than a cigarette paper, and I think this is serious, especially if we take into account the brave positions adopted by the Council on the Austrian issue. What I believe is this: On the issue of China and knowing the dotted failure of the European Union's policy towards China, the so -called constructive dialogue had no effect, or, even worse, gave new arguments to the Chinese to exert even more oppression, to reinforce it. Internet), in all areas, in Tibet, in the inner Mongolia, in eastern Turkestan. There is not a single sector of the Chinese civil society in which we do not observe reversals. It is proven: China is the big threat, the great threat to us, the one we need to face is a threat to peace. It is on the contrary of the democratic model and you know, like me, that the Chinese, that the Chinese leadership, above Chinese, is communist. China likes bilingualism. As long as we do not have a stable position, we will not achieve anything from the Chinese authorities. I therefore believe that we have to seize the opportunity. We have to join with the US initiative. We have to submit a strict text. This text must be voted on. We have to work. The fifteen must work, starting today, jointly with all the United Nations Member States, in order to eventually condemn a strict condemnation and then, on these bases, to be able to create room for dialogue. Mr President, I would like to try to introduce a different perspective on the subject. As you know, on Monday an unmanned spaceship was orbited around an peanut -shaped asteroid, called Eros, who is not far from Earth. The photos show us that there is no life in the asteroid, but much longer in our galaxy there are about 300 billion stars, many with planets. Outside our galaxy there are 300 billion other galaxies with countless stars and planets.	el
The courtyard indicates that these problems now appear and it designates measures that can be taken now to mitigate the problem.However, as Marinho pointed out, we need more, but that must wait for the CIG.In my own country, mythology talks about the swarming hordes of faceless bureaucrats in Brussels but it is never mentioned the number of European judges.There are less than three dozen at the head of the European judicial order - which is far from excessive given the responsibilities relating to their tasks to the curriculum of the European legal system.Their great importance can be noted at the level of political implications of the delay taken in the resolution of the suffering conflict between France to Great Britain with regard to British beef and which has aroused so much anger in my country and so much frustration due to the functioning of the procedures for resolving the Union conflicts.This situation has been aggravated, this is what some of the people who advise me believe, by the French Code of Procedure which places non -French nationals almost in the impossibility of translating the French Government into court.The thing is certainly perceived de facto as being impossible.This situation offers a very unfavorable contrast to the British courts where Spanish fishermen has successfully brought to justice the British government in very similar circumstances.Mr. President, what is happening in France seems primary to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals for reasons of nationality and, consequently, this situation seems to constitute a violation of the treaties.I would therefore like to ask the commissioner, who was kind enough to comment on my remarks during the previous debate, to examine this and to share his conclusions in Parliament and to myself.I would be grateful to the commissioner if he could confirm, in his final intervention, that it will be so.Mr. President, on behalf of the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, I would like to make the following answer.The Commission takes note from the point of view adopted today by the European Parliament as to the request of the Court of Justice and of the Court of First Instance which aims, on the one hand, to entrust the court to examine certain appeals which are currently emerging in the exclusive jurisdiction of the Court and, on the other hand, to increase the number of members of the court.On behalf of the Commission, let me add that I listened with great interest to the arguments that have just been put forward in this enclosure and that I very well understand the concern that underlies these arguments.The concern is legitimate.It has also been said that a delay in justice is a denial of justice.The Commission includes these considerations.Understanding them, I would like to continue my response as follows.As your parliament knows, the Commission is convinced that, without a deep reform, community legal bodies run the risk of being able to fulfill their mission within reasonable time.	fr
"Mr President, Member of the Commission, thanks for the Communication. I have three very short questions. The first question: We had to wait a long time for the Commission's consistent statement on the principle of preparedness, and in the past it was not at all clear whether the Commission was unanimous. Is it what you present here today, including the opinion of your colleague responsible for industrial matters, responsible for internal market matters and responsible for internal market matters? You certainly say ""yes"", but I would like to know from you: Do these gentlemen also know what consequences it has? The following question, Commission member Wallström: When do you begin to apply this principle in legislation, such as chemical legislation, for example in other field legislation? Last question: Can we see where this principle has been applied in legislation? That is, will each proposal in the future an additional page that says that the pre -preparedness principle has been revised and has come to this end?.(EN) Many thanks for these questions, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt. The whole Commission, of course, agrees with this. This is a common communication that we three, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, wrote, but today it has been unanimously approved by the Commission. It received strong support from other members of the Commission and has been consulted between the units throughout the Commission. So we have really gone through this document, and I am sure they are all able to describe the instructions and principles given in this document. Yes, I would say that we are already using this way of working on many difficult issues, such as the new chemical strategy. And I'm sure we will also tell you specifically when we apply this principle. We have recently applied the principle of pre-preparedness and denied phthalates in soft PVC toys;And of course, we apply it in many environmental areas. It has been applied mainly in the environment, but, of course, in matters related to human health. So we clearly try to say how and when we apply it. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, the Communication states that the use of the principle of science and pre -preparedness is that the use of a pre -preparedness principle still requires a political decision if the scientific evidence is missing. Thus, of course, a lot of power is given to science. We can ask ourselves what kind of experts provide the information and what they defend. The Communication also states that if there is a sufficient minority of the scientific community, it is sufficient to use the principle of preparation. I would like to ask how to define a ""recognized minority"". How do you define it? How do you end up with a recognized minority? When it comes to a political decision, I would also like to ask: Who makes a political decision? Commission? Is the Soviet? To what extent can the European Parliament play a role? What is the role of scientific committees? So what role will you come up with for the Food Agency, which you will soon start? Then finally: Is the whole decision -making in an open and public way? Here were three of my questions..(No) Yes, the President, it is true. There were many difficult questions and they were not always obvious, but I try to answer some questions. Who makes the decision, who are the decision -makers? Well, it depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management. For example, they need to look at concerns about a specific question and determine what scientific evidence says in a certain case. However, it is true that the pre -preparedness principle does not require a large majority of the scientific community. It can be applied based on a minority evidence or when the scientific evidence is not complete. Then you have to find a balance between this principle used as a political tool and scientific evidence. It is not always easy to describe accurately how this process progresses, but changing the scientific basis is not a question."	fi
The third military staff will be the representation of the high military of the fifteen countries, which will form civil and military secretariat with me, the task of which is to prepare for any operation with the help of the military committee that must be initiated in the area of ​​crisis management in the European Union at a given time.This crisis management will not be strictly a military surgery, but this military, the military committee, is also responsible for advice on logistics for any operations with a humanitarian character, where the inclusion of armed forces can be necessary.Today Mozambique is certainly an excellent example of the fact that one may not have to intervene from a military logistical point of view for military, but purely humanitarian purposes.We are working intensively, and if I would have told you a few months ago, when I was able to appear here for the first time, that on March 1, 2000 I would announce that the first time the committee for political and security issues came together, the military committee worked in a week and the next day the first employees of the military staff will be found in the building that we have in the European Union, many of them would have thought of it, the high representative, the high level of representativeMind lost.We have not lost the mind, we only worked hard, intensely and determined and without a doubt that we had the help and support not only from you, but also on the part of the heads of state and government of the countries they represent.Few initiatives in the area of ​​the European Union have been advanced with so much determination, momentum and commitment, as was the case with crisis management since Helsinki to this day.In less than two months, we started a mechanism in cooperation with the Commission.I would like to thank Commissioner Patten, who is here below us, for the support and the huge energy that he also spent on to bring all of these topics to the best possible conclusion in a relatively short time.Ladies and gentlemen!Allow me to go on to the second topic that I wanted to advise with you.We have already talked about the organs that we got on the way, but we have a fundamental obligation to sake our credibility: that Europe must be able to equip themselves with the military capacities in order to act in times of crisis management.I would like to repeat that the European Union does not intend to wage war with these military capacities, but to create peace, to participate in crisis management and to rush where war or conflict situations exist in order to contain, defuse and prevent them in the sense of the summit of Helsinki, which, as they are remembered, fell, with the participation of all EuropeanStates to set up a force of 60,000 soldiers who would be able to obtain their positions in 60 days - in two months - to prevent a crisis and continue this action for a year to prevent conflict.It is a large-scale operation, a big goal that we have set, but I can tell you that we are able to take this challenge that the heads of state and government in Helsinki have taken into account.	de
In this context, I would like to remind you of a new rural development support system approved in May 1999, which formed a community framework for sustainable rural development, and as you know, one of the reforms that were the results of Agenda 2000 negotiations and the progress of the community -level agricultural issues.This framework of community assistance aims to turn the rural emptying through the European Agricultural Guidance and Warranty Fund (Emotr), to which a member of the Parliament very rightly referred to in his question.On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) contributes to financial and social cohesion by correcting the major regional imbalances and participating in the development and renewal of rural areas.In this context, it is good to point out that ERDR also promotes sustainable rural development and also sustainable creation of rural jobs.The whole of these community tools allows us to work on the rural development policy, which is now one of the improvements and lines of development in common agricultural policy, one of its dimensions, and on the other hand it is a regional policy.We believe that this is one of the most important issues in the concept of multi-influence, which is now linked to the development of a common agricultural policy and, of course, the EMOTR Fund plays a central role here.Question 9 (H-0798/99): Subject: Agricultural Policy During the Portugal Presidency, Can Council outlines the primary objectives of the Portugal Presidency in the Community's Agricultural Policy over the next six months and indicate the actions it considers necessary to increase consumer confidence in the field of agriculture and products?The question that a member of the Parliament sets on a common agricultural policy touches us close by. It's always a good idea to be present in Parliament's discussions, as we probably have a lot to discuss in the future on this topic.During the Portuguese Presidency, we must continue to discuss the Circle by changing some common market arrangements, keeping in mind the positive development of the union's balanced development and guarantee of the income of farmers.Particular attention must be paid to measures that may have an impact on small family farms.If, and when the new round of the World Trade Organization begins during the Portugal Presidency, which is still uncertain, Portugal, the Presidium State, of course, will not cease to guarantee the strengthening of community products in the world market and the greater balance between the exports of the Community's agricultural products and the multi -effective Union's permanence.The Presidential State Portugal will also emphasize the deepening of a food safety policy and I think the Portugal Foreign Minister and the Chairman of the Council of the European Union already referred here this morning.We believe that the role of food safety, specifically in everything related to public health, must be developed in our presidency;So it is one of the issues of our program.We will develop it by four parallel dimensions of the Agricultural Council, the Health Council, the Consumer Protection Council and the Internal Market Council.In June of this year, Portugal, the Presidential State, will publish a report on this issue at the Santa Maria da Feira Council of Europe, specifically what the Commission had presented in its White Book some time ago.We believe that the work that has to be done from now on for the establishment of the European Union Agency is essential due to the credibility of the internal market, due to the establishment of trust in these markets, due to the relief of tensions between some Member States, and why it could not be said because the general attitude of the European Union.We are trying to do this work during the Portuguese Presidency and we hope that at the end of the Presidency, we can present the result of these efforts here in Parliament.I thank the chairman of the Council for the answer.I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat of the European model of family farming, mainly for farmers who are involved in the production of beef and sheep meat and are now expected to sell their production at the cost of production costs or cheaper.I would like to ask what actions the new Council will take to secure their interests in future world trade negotiations, especially against livestock and factory-type production in the United States and New Zealand, whose economic differences make competitive family farming extremely difficult for European farmers and where European foods are not valid.	fi
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that an employee statute will be accepted as soon as possible?In the meantime, can you ensure that the provisions of the parliament properly use and that employees, as it should be, are paid according to the work they do for us?Without them we would not be able to work.Mr President, I also have a question about the rules of procedure.Are there any regulations that regulate demonstrations in this parliament and outside the plenary hall, so that the MPs can enter the plenary hall unhindered and be able to meet their obligations?If there are such regulations, who is responsible for enforcement and how do those responsible do justice to this task?Mr President, I would like to come back to the problem of the assistant statute that we always considered primarily and inform them that the Italian members of the PSE parliamentary group followed the request of our parliamentary group leader, Mr. Barón Crespo, and the contracts that we have concluded with the assistants have given the queest.I think this is a concrete step towards solving this problem, and I therefore ask the Presidium of Parliament to think about whether it should not ask all MPs to do so.Mr President, first of all I would like to find that I am fully advocating a statute for the employees.When I arrived in parliament yesterday, a document for the proposed demonstration of the employees in front of the parliament was presented to me.As all colleagues know - and many of them have contacted me in the past six months - applications for exhibitions and the like are initially sent to the Comart Committee of Parliament.To give you a neutral example: In this parliament, no commercial exhibitions may be carried out in this parliament for reasons that are obvious.After I received a letter yesterday, I immediately proposed the employees to carry out a meeting or a demonstration soon next month.The implementation of such events must never affect the normal work of parliament.Yesterday afternoon I signed a letter during the advisory of the Presidium of Parliament, which informs the employees accordingly.As I have learned, they were orally informed about this decision by the committee of the parliamentary group leader.So they were aware of the decision.We always have an open ear for the problems of the employees, and there is definitely the possibility of a corresponding event during the next conference of the parliament.But there must be a misunderstanding here, because you obviously received a letter from someone else you understood as a commitment.However, all exhibition applications are initially checked by the so-called Comart committee.As you can see, we have a lot of exhibitions here in parliament, be dedicated to different countries or whatever topic.This is by no means an attempt to censorship and in no way is directed against the very realistic and legitimate demand for a statute for employees.Thank you very much, Ms. Banotti.Your explanations can certainly help clarify various of the questions raised here.Mr President, we are dealing with a problem here.	de
Therefore, as a partner I recognize the Greek government first. Then I have to ensure the spread and decentralization of this partnership, and I will do so. I can only work with the Greek government. I think that my colleague Mr. Alavanos will give all this information to Mr Commissioner to keep in mind, because they are really propaganda and not a promotion of Community programs. However, I would also like to ask Mr Commissioner to take into account the following: that for all national and regional programs, Greece is considered a region expressed - at the level of partnership with the European Union - by the central administration by the central government. In this respect, neither local government, nor - much more - non -governmental organizations, such as agricultural cooperatives interested in a growth of the agricultural sector, take part in shaping the proposals for the third Community support framework and, of course, for the previous Community support. How can the committee deal with? Mr. Theonas, I repeat once again what I said to Mr Alavanos: I will consider the issue closely and, if needed, acting under the framework of the structural funds, I will make observations not on how to manage the resources of the structural funds, but not yet. But I repeat, I have to respect the national principle with which I have to negotiate. I will, however, examine the situation objectively. After all, if you have, Lord Theonas, recommendations or suggestions on the involvement of some structures - you talked about cooperative, if I understood well - I am willing to hear them and ready, based on the proposalsFunds. Why not say that we have found in the past from the Greek Government some inadequacy in the implementation of the new and previous regulation on the participation of civil society representatives? I say it objectively and, when we find a problem or a deficiency, we must eliminate them. Therefore, I will take care of this as part of the implementation of the new Community Support Framework. Question No.45 of K. (H -0041/00): Subject: Funding of Nuclear Energy Research for Pacific Use by Structural Funds could be confirmed by the Commission that during the last planning period of the 1994-1999 Structural Funds? Could it be committed to excluding any funding measures from this type of research in the ongoing negotiations with Member States on plans and programs of the new period 2000-2006? What role will, on the other hand, play the contribution of structural funds to the promotion of renewable energy sources? Could it be expected to finance structural funds in the energy policy sector to focus on promoting regional and renewable energy resources? Will the Structural Funds also fund large energy transport networks?	el
"In addition, I hope that our Parliament also takes into account the statement of the Employment and Social Committee, which adds a new perspective to the context, paying attention to essential areas such as the prevention of social exclusion, support for cooperative and community economy, and the implementation of the employment strategy. Schroedter's work is another new step towards the openness and efficiency of the construction subsidies. It emphasizes all actors and, above all, local actors who are able to define the characteristics and social problems of their areas alone, a growing and primary task, and for this reason we want to be sure that the partnership to be carried out is a genuine partnership. As a result, we have renewed our request to establish a structural center in the Member States, which is responsible for reconciling the implementation and management of structural subsidies. For this reason, the follow -up committees must be opened to members of the European Parliament, organizations and industry representatives, and civil society. These guidelines will improve the efficiency of community structure subsidies. They are in the right direction in a re -modified form of Schroedter's report. They also provide stimulation of public debate on the future of cohesion policy after 2006, but it is another discussion. Until then, let us support this first step..(EN) This report requires significant cuts in the number of illegal government subsidies issued by some Member States. Although I support this goal unreservedly, I would rather be removed completely. In my opinion, illegal state subsidies are only state -funded social dumping. We all oppose the social dumping of speculators, and we must also oppose social dumping by government. In order for us to have an efficient cohesive market that makes the European industry competitive worldwide and bring wealth and employment to all Europeans, we must have equal competition opportunities. On the other hand, illegal state subsidies destroy competitive companies and generate unemployment. Of course, there are cases where state aid may be necessary and justified, for example, when companies are helped to renew their structure. However, in all these cases, the harsh criteria must be met and the approval of the European Commission first. Whether it is beef or bribes to be taken to France, we must not let the EU Member States break the law. I am enthusiastic about the proposal for the report to publish a ""scoreboard"", which describes the amount of state aid from each Member State. The countries who claim to be at the heart of Europe but systematically violate the rules should be named and their hypocrisy should be revealed. We must not let Member States publicly shout European solidarity while trying to secretly weaken the uniform market. I find it somewhat encouraging that the number of state subsidies granted to European industry seems to be decreasing. However, much still has to be done, and I urge the Commission to be much more severe and to reveal the European State Armomans..(PT) Because the Commission's main tools for winning regional differences are the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund, it is essential that the European Parliament will participate in the preparation of their guidelines without questioning the principle of the secondaryity, since the definition of each country's development strategy belongs to that member state. Unfortunately, the European Commission has already progressed in its guidelines and the position of Parliament for 2000-2006 programs is of great importance. However, it is important to keep that the main priority of these funds must be the most difficult countries and regions of major difficulties - such as Portugal and Azores and Madeira areas - with the aim of achieving economic and social cohesion. Now the truth is that the Commission's guidelines do not fully follow these goals. On the other hand, it is important that there are accurate instructions and sufficient funds in areas such as creating quality jobs, effective promotion of rights such as equally rights and opportunities, supporting solidarity economy and social economy, rural development, and supporting small and medium-sized businesses and improving the quality of the city. Through housing production, for sustainable urban living development."	fi
Finally, I would highlight a very central paragraph that deals with the limits of emissions related to air and water - whether it be heavy metals or dust, ammonia, dioxin, sulfur dioxide or other hazardous substances. In my opinion, some defense levels have been found, and a sensible balance has been achieved between the actual incineration plants and the parallel incineration plants. I hope that this balance will remain tomorrow in the vote in the Chamber. Once again, I disagree with Parliament, Grossetête, because I think the emission limits set in the report are realistic, technologically possible, and the situation is simply that they are used in some Member States. Even for existing institutions that do not yet meet the requirements, a fairly long, several years to adapt to the new requirements set out in the report. So I hope that in tomorrow's vote, we can make our own contribution to solving environmental and health problems related to waste incineration so that the incredible amounts of waste we produce daily do not cause any additional damage to the environment or health. Mr President, Blokland has done a huge job! This is the most complicated. There have been an incredible number of advocates of the benefit. I could never believe that so many in Europe would care about waste. I would have thought it was gold and not waste. For the future, it may be good that the recycling industry is in the birth, which is so valid and powerful in economically and in human resources. The EU must, of course, create a sustainable system to protect air, land and water. It is our common obligation, our common responsibility. It is also clear that we must draw up the rules of the Union. However, is it right that at the Union level we will produce such detailed technical descriptions as this Directive attempts to do? Should we not only decide on the permissible emission levels, measurement systems of different substances, how the measurement is carried out and that the principle of subsidiarity is then applied? Northern Skandinavia, where transport routes are also long, and in densely populated areas of Central Europe, which is literally more of a cleaning problem and waste burning than, for example, combined heat and power generation, the differences are in huge waste treatment and large biofuel. I would like to discuss at some point, though not now, about the possibilities of creating the legislation on this issue. Mr President, I, too, would like to congratulate Member of the Parliament Blokland for this report that sets European-wide standards for waste incineration, for the first time, for the first time, the standards for dioxin and furan emissions;This should increase competition between different waste treatment methods and thus help you stop transporting hazardous waste across Europe when looking for the cheapest waste facility operator. Given the predicted growth of waste incineration, it is of paramount importance that the general EU legislation on waste treatment and air quality is consistent and comprehensive. We need to look at the entire waste hierarchy. Waste incineration may become more common as landfill controls are tightened, but it goes hand in hand with recycling and environmentally friendly waste treatment methods. Construction of new incineration plants is an expensive and long -term project, which in turn must ensure that investors' long -term return to continue to burn waste in the interests of investors. This means the risk of overcapacity, while at the same time encouraging waste incineration to gain profit and not our goal for waste reduction, recycling and safe handling. Parliament must protect the health and quality of life we ​​represent. There is no safe threshold for dioxin emissions, and the effects of micro -particles on human health and environment are currently being investigated. We therefore need to ensure that repeated testing and follow -up is provided that citizens are provided with regular and detailed information and that we take real action if the rules are violated.	fi
I have no doubt about it and believe that it is an essential element.In this context, I also wanted to point out that we have to be careful what we say.Last week, the new finance minister of the Austrian coalition spoke of the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theater.We, which we had to live under dictatorial conditions, know that there can be a dictatorship with a sham parliament.We know there is no democracy without a living parliament.I think such a language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it from here.With regard to the four major priorities that President President PRODI systematically referred to, I would say that we completely agree with the analysis of the challenges.But I would like to point out the commission that there is a change in priorities for the socialist group.In our opinion, the top priority of the economic and social-political agenda, which includes what is also called quality of life in its priorities, that is, the rights of citizens as consumers and also as people.This deals with questions that we always assume as given, but do not emphasize sufficiently, for example about the European social model and its adaptation to new circumstances, the consumer rights and the protection of the environment and for sustainable development.If there is talk of the commitment to full employment, it must be assumed that full employment no longer means the same thing today as in the Beveridge Epoche at the end of the Second World War, namely work for the male head of the family.One has to assume the equality of the sexes, from the famous gender mainstreaming, which is one of the topics less treated in the Prodi program.This presupposes that we give priority to gender equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, the clear fight against populism in which our economic and social cohesion is threatened.This must also enjoy the highest priority in the work of the Commission.And it has to go hand in hand with a clear struggle against racism and intolerance to provide practical confirmation that the Union has developed into an attraction for the rest of the world and due to its prosperity and its outdated population structure.In my opinion, this must be the main goal that we have to follow.Here I would add another element, namely the economic government, with a unit currency - I believe that it prevails.This is also a question in which the Commission has to progress.With regard to the ambitious goals and especially with regard to something important that the Commission did, namely to decide on the expansion and integration process in the course of a negotiation and integration process, I would of course want my faction - that one would be more clear in connection with the revision of the Agenda 2000.Does the commission believe that there will be no revision until the end?And we also consider the stress to be a key topic.In my opinion, a theoretical consideration can be very interesting about governing in general.	de
"My group is delighted that the ""Social Affairs"" council, from the end of last year, gave its green light to a better cooperation strategy and that, moreover, a group of senior officials has already received the mission of presenting a first report to the Council in June 2000. But we would like, as Parliament and especially as a social democratic group, which Lisbon is now making an additional step.It is very important that this European Parliament pleads, through the report of our colleague, for a truly European strategy of social convergence, by analogy with what has been implemented for employment via the Luxembourg strategy, a strategy, therefore, endowed with community objectives, guidelines, national action plans and services assessments.We believe that this track is ambitious, but however accessible.It is indeed obvious that the harmonization of social security at European level is not realistic.Systems, in terms of financing and organization, are too diversified to do this and this is also an important reason why social protection barely leads to the European agenda.This is also the reason why scenarios such as the thirteenth Member State of Dany Peeters or the European Social Serpent have barely taken off from the ground.But this new track is particularly interesting.The employment strategy has shown that it was able to operate and social convergence is also necessary, because our social security systems face the same challenges and, at the UEM era, social security systems threatens to become an element of social competition.But let me point out a point in the name of my group: social convergence strategies can in no case constitute an alternative to social legislation.They can only serve as a very useful complement to what we put on and what we expect from the Commission with regard to social legislation.I think it is also good that the European Parliament tries to convince the Council to make the community strategy concretize as soon as the Lisbon meeting and to launch, at the beginning of 2001, an annual procedure aimed at reducing the poverty rate.I am happy that the European Parliament supports this idea of ​​my group and we hope, Madam Commissioner, that we will also benefit from your support.Finally, we insist that the European Parliament and the social partners as well as social NGOs are closely involved in this process.Only a broad and democratic basis will be able to offer guarantees for the success of this strategy and we hope for your support.Mr. President, the formulation of the four main objectives that the governments of the EU member states accepted in November of the past year and which were mentioned today is so vast that everyone should be able to approve them.I remind you: there is the idea that all work must be worth being carried out in order to ensure a guaranteed income, the certainty of being able to provide pensions and the need to make the regime of sustainable pensions, the promotion of social integration and the guarantee of sustainable and high quality health care.On the other hand, we could only derive an intellectual benefit from the creation of a group of high -level civil servants, which would be the hub for the exchange of experiences in terms of coordination and evaluation of progress made within the framework of social policy and that of the job market."	fr
I only apologize for the fact that my commitment to open the European Reconstruction Agency on Monday meant that I could not take part in that Middle East, although I mentioned earlier today -what is another thing -for some coincidences I got stuck on Munich airport and couldn't get to Thessaloniki. That's what life is. I hope that the dignified members will forgive me if I can't be here until the end of the conversation, as I would like to be in normal circumstances. The discussion was agreed this morning, and on that basis I agreed with guests from the Balkans this evening. So I hope I can rely on Parliament's understanding of this. I can assure you that this is not the kind of thing I would like to take. Like dignified members, I am pleased with the US efforts, which have reintroduced the negotiations between Syria and Israel, despite the decision of the Syrian representatives, that they need more time before the negotiations were to start on schedule today. There are reasonable hopes that the basis for a peace agreement can be built in the near future. I also hope that progress on the Syrian path will even out the way for negotiations between Lebanon and Israel, which could then proceed side by side towards an overall contract for Israeli relations with their northern neighbors. At the same time, we should not let the Palestinian path visible. The position of the Palestinians has always been the core of the conflict. A fair and generous agreement with them is still the key to the permanent peace of the Middle East. The Israelis and the Palestinians have made significant progress in the implementation of the Sharm El Sheikh agreement. Although some setbacks have come, I believe that the remaining reset of Israeli troops will soon be realized. Similarly, despite the signs of a day -to -day framework for a permanent status, the timetable has been postponed over the mid -February period, I hope to remain in a much more important September deadline for the final agreement on permanent status. I was assured that this was also the position of Prime Minister Barak and President Arafat as they met on Monday. Dear members know that one of our special concerns has been that progress would continue on a multilateral road. It is anything but straight, but we can do this to make this possible in close cooperation with our US and Russian support partners and regional parties. We have a special responsibility for promoting regional economic development. The launch of negotiations with Syria paved the way to the gathering of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of this month. I am eagerly looking forward to attending that meeting and I hope that we can finally start driving things again. The European Union plays an important role in the peace process, such as all parties - the Palestinians, the Israelis, their Arab neighbor and the United States - have acknowledged. And our role is not limited to the role of a banker alone. We must be ready to work quickly to support the establishment of peace in the area. However, we should not scream ourselves: comprehensive peace in the Middle East has an expensive price. The Commission is already looking at how recent encouraging events affect the European Union. We are about to share our thoughts in more detail to Parliament and the Council. However, I can recall worthwhile members of the Parliament that the Union is not at all bad in the financial support of the peace process. We have made the biggest donations to the Palestinians. We have also provided a very significant support for Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. With the Israeli people, we have established a close cooperation in many areas of particular importance to them. The community's over $ 600 million in donations and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively supported Palestinian leadership and significantly contributed to the rebuilding of the West Bank and the Gaza region's deteriorated physical infrastructure. The Member States of the European Union have jointly awarded another EUR 860 million during this critical period.	fi
In Europe, according to the opinion of your rapporteur, this attitude has offered us negative services in previous years, not only once, but reassigned. This attitude has a downward risks that, from what I understand, the Council of Finance Ministers is currently discussing. These risks concern a correction of the US economy and the future trend of oil prices and long -term EU interest rates. If any of these dangers have a negative impact, what will our answer - more Laissez faire be better off? I had proposed that parliament should recommend an active economic policy, consisting of two main parts. One is the adoption of the Committee itself and the Council to convert it into an action program that will concern some linked quantitatively identified investment and employment objectives, which will make it operational and reliable. The central point of such a program should be the increase in the level of investment for the formation of capital from 19%, where it had fallen to at least 23-24% of the GDP, both in the private and public sectors. In order for the public sector to acquire the necessary important lead in investment policy, the Council should certainly sacrifice some of its sacred cows. He should revise his negative attitude towards the large infrastructure programs of trans -European networks, which have long been dusting in drawers, in order to be adequately funded by bonds from the European Community and to accept an interpretation of the concept of fiscal deficitStability Agreement. This is the first key pillar of my composition. The second basic pillar encompasses a large number of structural reforms, privatizations, barriers to remove, as well as proposals that facilitate the transition to a knowledge -based economy, which, as we know, is the backbone of the Presidency's proposals. As experts have repeatedly reported, the structural reform program coupled with an expansive investment and development program is capable of getting the European economy out of inactivity, while unilateral policies are doomed to failure. Unfortunately, my colleagues of the People's Party, with the help and motivation of the Liberals of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy, saw my approach unacceptable. I am glad that at least after five years of perseverance, they considered the goal of full employment. However, I have to say that the mere reference to full -time, without the proposal of a specific program to achieve the goal, sounds as a dishonest promise and is not so persuaded as the optimistic political message that people are waiting to hear from us, who have been waiting for it for a long time. It is of course not my job to judge the alliances of others, but if the European People's Party and the Liberal Party desperately fasten their alliance, let them suggest at least something positive, which will have the chance to work, and not to repeat our own,Efforts of other people, simply to oppose them.	el
In addition, the chairman's conclusions define four pillars, which in the future form the basis of a common asylum and immigration policy: partnership with the countries of origin, a common European asylum system, fair treatment of third-country citizens, and more effective management of immigration flows. Above all, I would like to emphasize the fact that the European Union should have a comprehensive immigration approach that takes into account political aspects, human rights and development issues in the starting and transit countries: combating poverty, improving living conditions and working opportunities, prevention of conflicts, and human rights.for minorities. I would like to assure that the Union and its Member States absolutely respect the right to apply for asylum on the basis of full and comprehensive application of the Geneva Convention. I also want to emphasize the effort to develop an effective integration policy for third -country citizens of the Union Member States. In the end, it must be acknowledged that, although these measures are needed to ensure the peace of our Member States, the fight against illegal immigration and the protection of the rights of the victims of immigration of immigration must also be increased, paying special attention to the rights of women and children. So I agree with the rapporteur's concern and hope that Parliament also shares them. The Commission wants to inform you that we are going to respond to your concerns and our concerns and the demands of Tampere's assignment by presenting all the most important tools in Parliament and the Council to the Parliament and the Council: Common Procedures, Dublin Convention Review and EUROCAC in its final form. At the same time, in the autumn, the Commission also intends to present to Parliament a communication of immigration policy in the European Union. In our opinion, the 1994 disclosure must be reformed and the management of matters relating to the Union's immigration policy must be modernized in the light of the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. Good members of the Parliament, in terms of the inadequacy of legal services in the debate, the Commission does not intend to address certain theoretical and practical issues, even though they are very interesting, such as the care of national referees or the duration of legal proceedings in many Member States, in this field, in this field, must be followed by the principle of a secondaryity. In this context, the Commission wants to emphasize that the Green Book on Legal Aid is a good support for defining common rules for the protection of the accused, such as interpreting and translation aid in international trials, and a more comprehensive program on reciprocal recognition of court decisions. With regard to civil law, we believe that communizing more civilian rights is an effective way to ensure the actual applicability of human rights in courts. The Commission has already proposed that all current and ended conventions, and in particular the Convention on the submission of the minutes, and in addition to the second Convention on the Brussels and Bankruptcy Convention, will be communed. We have also suggested that the Brussels Convention on the validity, recognition and implementation of civilian and commercial decisions in 1968 be transformed into a regulation. All of these tools are currently being discussed by the Council. Even the United Kingdom and Ireland have decided to join the other Member States, and Denmark, which cannot participate in civilian cooperation, also participates in the ongoing search for solutions. Finally, I would remind the Parliament in terms of figures for children and women, although they mainly concern matters within the competence of the Member States that the Commission and I ourselves are undertaken to submit a package of action on these topics by the end of the year. The purpose of the measures is to go beyond the joint activities approved in February 1997. The measures concern the definitions, accusations and punishments of sexual abuse of trafficking in human beings and sexual abuse of children. I am now going to Ludford's report. I have a very positive attitude that I have the opportunity to respond to Parliament's report on racism and alien hatred. In the Amsterdam Treaty, the Union made it very clear that it is committed to supporting fundamental rights and rejecting discrimination, and this is, in my opinion, the central content of a message from the Union.	fi
We will work for it.We will see if we can achieve a consensus.Inquiry No. 5 of (H-0785/99): Contributions: Proposal for a regulation to determine the permissible total fishing quantities for certain fish stocks for the year 2000, especially in the case of the Sarfish reports from the International Council for Sea Research, the anchovial stocks in the ICES area are currently in a critical condition.The Council of Minister for Fishing Questions and the Commission have considered the effects of the transfer of the quota for the ICES areas IX, X and the Copace area 34.1.1 from Portugal to France (overfishing of 5,000 tons per year) on the ancient fields of the ICES area VIII and about their responsibility for the current position of these fishing sectorthought?Does the Council consider it to be justifiable in view of the clearly precarious situation of these stocks, to create a permanent basis for such an overfishing and exceeding the permissible total fishing quantity that was originally set to 33,000 tons annually?What measures will the Council take and when will it take them to take into account the critical state of the anchovy stocks of the quota transmission mentioned and the principle of the relative stability of fishing activity?President!The Portuguese presidency has the greatest interest to answer this question completely, also because it is related to a problem that affects Portugal in a positive sense, and I also explain why.The Council is aware of the critical situation of the anchovy stocks in the Cantabric Sea, of which the Lord spoke.At the last council of the ministers for fishing questions on December 16 and 17 of last year, the Member States who operate this fishing, and these are France, Spain and Portugal, came to the opinion that the application of the precautionary principle, in which the permissible total catchment from 5,000 tons was screwed down to 2,000 tons, was too as a precaution.In order to reduce a balanced relationship between the need to reduce the biological risks - i.e. the impairment of the fish species - and the economic and social problems caused by a restriction of fishing, a compromise solution was found by setting the permissible total fishing amount to the average level of 16,000 t instead of the 33,000 t in 1999.Their review was also planned on the basis of new scientific information on species protection, and it is expected that the relevant information can be disposed of in the first half of this year.For the southern anchovy population, in the ICES area IX, the permissible total fishing amount for the entire year 2000 was set at 10,000 t, while it was still 13,000 t in 1999.The exchange of fishing rates between Portugal and France was proportional from 5 008 t in 1999 to 3,000 t in 2000, which can be caught in French waters.I would like to point out that this quota transfer does not increase the pressure on the anchovy stocks as a whole, for the entire space of community fishing.According to the principle of the relative stability, the distribution key for anchovies in the Cantabric Sea Spain and France only assigns 10 %.	de
For the time being, this is my opinion.It may be the subject of discussions here and elsewhere.I will listen to any suggestion but my first conclusion is that this authority should occupy a central position rather than peripheral.Dear colleagues, I find myself in a very difficult situation, because I cannot change the agenda.I would suggest that you discuss this subject within your political groups and to raise the question during the Conference of Presidents.If you believe that these sessions which follow a declaration from the Commission are important, I would suggest that we are asking for more time than the half hour dedicated to them.This time, the questions posed by the deputies lasted six minutes and the reports and the declaration of the commissioner lasted 29 minutes.As you can see, half an hour is really not enough for such sessions.I hope you discuss it in your political groups so that we can participate in better structured sessions with the commission on future occasions.The debate is closed.Question time (commission) The agenda calls the time for questions to the Commission (B5-0003/2000).I inform you that we will devote about an hour and fifteen minutes to this time.The scheduled time will therefore be slightly shortened because the performers work today in continuous session.The word is to Mr. Purvis for a procedural motion.I have an objection as to the fact that we decrease the time for the time of questions;This is one of the rare opportunities in which the common deputies has the opportunity to intervene and I ask you to extend it at an hour and a half as it is stipulated in the agenda.It's the agenda and I think we have to stick to it.Dear colleague, if we stick to the agenda, we should have started at 5.30 p.m., but you see the time it is.In any case, I hope that we will not arrive in night session.First part Question no 28 of (H-0781/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in a region of Turkey with strong seismicity the two earthquakes, of a magnitude greater than 7 on the Richter scale, recently occurred in Turkey arouse the most lively concerns before the will displayed by Turkey to build costly nuclear reactors in Akuyu, even as the excessProduced by the Ataturk dams is exported to third countries and which the EU is leaving for its own resources to contribute to the repair of the damage caused by earthquakes.We are led to think that the Turkish nuclear program, which ignores the dangers incurred by the inhabitants and the ecosystems of the country and the whole of the region, serves as a facade for a strategy arrested by the political authorities of Turkey to acquire the nuclear technology which will allow them to acquire nuclear weapons, insofar as they seek to acquire the same reactors, whichPakistan.What actions does the Commission have to undertake to prevent any nuclear disaster and oppose the acquisition of nuclear weapons by a country that wishes to join the EU and affects considerable sums to nuclear programs, even though it absorbs community credits for financial assistance?	fr
In many respects, the treatment inflicted on the original inhabitants of the United States of America goes against the most fundamental human rights.The history of Dineh Indians is significant.With the discovery and - certainly - the exploitation of black gold and, later, uranium and oil, all means were good to chase these populations of their land and send them to regions offering few other perspectives than poverty, deprivation and pollution.The Arizona region, which must become the new Dineh Indian territory was affected, in 1979, by the largest nuclear disaster known by the United States.We therefore plan to send the last 4,000 Dineh Indians to these lands.The struggle of these Indians is supported by more than 250 NGOs and we were made aware of this situation thanks to the action of the Belgian organization for Mother Earth.It is also significant for American society which has hardly heard of it.They are very careful about wars and genocides taking place in other parts of the world but they unjustly ignore the genocide which takes place in their own country.Today, the Dineh Indians begin their last fight for their right to land, their right to dignity and, above all, their right to choose their lifestyle.However, there are only a few while their opponent is a very powerful economic fact.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I join the many remarks made by the previous speakers but I would still like to emphasize a few elements.The Dineh people are one of the Navajo Indians in North America.They have been faced with exclusion and have been fighting for survival for decades.They have lived for many years in heartbreaking conditions.The conditions of poverty in which they live forces them to give in, on the ground floor, to the financial and economic pressure exerted by the mining industry.The reimplantation law introduced in 1974, which aims to a new distribution of the Navajo reserves, authorizes the displacement of population groups.These re -implantations are naturally unacceptable because human rights are flouted, both economically and culturally.The Dineh Indians are moved like pawns and lose in the adventure not only their history and their essential land for them - the land of their ancestors - but also any prospect of work and source of income.The reimplantation law was pushed to the congress by a group representing the mining industry.Congress has never asked itself the question of where the inhabitants of the region should go and what influence would have this re -implantation on their lives.The population did not have a voice in the chapter.It looks like human trafficking.The reimplantation was carried out and the Dineh people were moved to a region polluted by uranium.After the rupture of a barrage in the New Mexico in 1979, and the release of 370,000 m3 of radioactive water and 1100 tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the most polluted regions in the world.	fr
Two questions: First, you said that you will start dialogue with citizens and I am already starting with 700 trainees with the European Commission.Do you also intend to contact citizens via the media, that is to say also via television and internet?My second question is critical.The European Commission has just submitted a proposal for transparency.If I compare it with the proposal for transparency that works in the Netherlands at the legislative level, it is just a pale reflection and has raised many criticisms in the Netherlands.My question is therefore the following: how do you mean to guide transparency with regard to the CIG because the directive we currently have is not a good example?Madam MP, Minister Maij-Weggen, since we are talking about transparency about the CIG, you know how things are going to be done.Negotiation begins at the moment.The group of representatives is in a meeting in Brussels and I will endeavor to join him earlier.The documents will be mostly open documents, working documents.We are not going to discuss in front of the media during the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between the ministers and the European Council, but I have committed myself, I cannot do something else at this stage, to practice this transparency and to account, in the most appropriate pregnant, of this negotiation and from the point of view of the Commission.I confirm to you, thanking you for questioning me on this point, that we will use all modern means, television in particular, which will be able to retransmit in this or that country, even at European level, our public debates.We will open a forum on the Internet, create permanent discussion forums.The commissioners will undertake to answer quickly to all the questions that will be asked.We will use all these modern means.But I believe that you also have to make the effort to go as close as possible to people.I would like, in all regions of Europe -no doubt it is still a little utopian -I would like a commissioner, when he can, a European parliamentarian, a minister, can go to public debates.I have proof that it is possible.Most of you make these debates in their constituencies, in their regions.From a slightly more selfish point of view of the Commission, I would like this institution, in the minds of citizens, to have a face, that men and women who constitute it can go as often as possible to meet citizens.Mr. President, I salute the commitment made by Mr. Barnier to go to the regions, in order to explain themselves and listen to what the citizens have to say.I would like to invite it in my own region, Yorkshire, which fully participates in the European single market and is an important beneficiary of European structural funds.He can go there with the two caps he carries as a commissioner.I would like to ask him with what vigor the commission intends to carry out this information campaign?	fr
One of the most important transfers -the transfer Tajo -Segura -, which has been in operation for many years, almost 30 years, has an approval for 658 HM3/year.The largest amount broadcast in one year was 453, and the transmission agent in 20 years is just over two hundred.We cannot be accused of poor management.And is the commissioner known that of these 263 HM3, a lot of 25 HM3 for irrigation purposes on the left edge of the Levant, 30 HM3 for the supply in the area of ​​the Júcar, 7 HM3 are used for care and irrigation for the supply in the southern area of ​​the Júcar and the rest in the area of ​​Segura?We also do not operate badly.We cannot be forbidden to carry out transfers if our economy and the development of our areas depend.I am not addressing the topic of quality and the available technical improvements because I think we will negotiate this guideline again.But look: In this pluralistic Europe that we are building in the community spirit, you have to search for pluralistic and non -uniform solutions.Therefore, I appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this parliament, and when voting, the various European countries do not uniform in such questions in which subsidiarity must be enforced.Ms. Commissioner: Andalusia is not Lapland.President, Dear MPs!First of all, let me thank the environmental committee and above all the rapporteur, Ms. Lienemann, for an ambitious and constructive work on this framework directive for water policy.Water is one of our most important natural powers, which numerous speakers have already emphasized.An ambitious and balanced European water policy is an important partial aspect for sustainable development in Europe.The water is also one of the areas that I will pay special attention during my tenure.I am delighted with the spirit of agreement that goes through the amendments brought by Parliament.Many of these applications are based on the extremely constructive, informal conversations that were led in connection with the first reading between Parliament and Council.Most of the changes proposed by the parliament contribute to an improvement and tightening of the text.The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments.A large number of amendments that Parliament brought in indicates that mediation will be essential.With regard to these upcoming negotiations, I therefore appeal to the parliament to vote for an ambitious statement.First I would like to give some of my most important arguments.We now have the opportunity to put the obligations received in connection with the OSPAR convention.Before we think of a legal liability of these objectives, we have to consider their political nature, as is also reflected in some applications for change in the parliament. As far as the water fees are concerned, this guideline will determine the water policy of Europe for the next three decades.Therefore, it is our obligation to make sure that the right incentives and the right drives for an effective fee structure and pricing, which contribute to improving our environment in an inexpensive way.	de
", in writing.(NL) We approved the Haarder report, but we would like to make the following observations on paragraphs 19 and 20 of the Exhibition Plan. Paragraph 19 concerns the requirement of Belgium to sign the map for national minorities. It is not true that Flanders refuses to validate Belgium this map, but this must be done provided that it does not apply to the Belgian constitutional grid. According to the Constitution, the Belgian Federation states are equal. None of them is a national minority. Since the map does not provide a clear definition of the concept of national minority, Flanders considers that it does not apply to the Belgian case: in a similar context the term ""national minority""? It may only relate to a minority that has been established in a particular region for centuries, while French -speaking people have been installed in the region only for three decades and have refused to join, according to what is expected under normal circumstances (see Flemish migration to the Vallenia and their full -fledged. In addition, French -speaking French -speaking people have linguistic facilities and therefore enjoy a protection that the real minorities can not even imagine. So those who use this map to change the situation in the Brussels region undermine Belgium's constitutional balance and prove once again the ignorance of Europe in terms of our federal system, which leads us to conclude that there are two separate states and two -member states. Most likely, French -speaking Belgian MPs of the European Parliament will once again use this vote for internal Belgian political games. We do not wish to participate in these actions from which we want to completely distance ourselves. By the way, we are sorry for the fact that paragraph 5 of the Ludford report included a similar excerpt about racism and xenophobia. In the context of the same perspective, Flanders considers that the map for minority languages, as stated in paragraph 20 of the Haarder report, does not concern the situation in the French -speaking region, but the Limburus dialect (which in the Netherlands is recognized in accordance with that map) or the German Areler in the province of Luxembourg., in writing.(It) It is true of our indignation, in addition to the amendments approved or rejected and the paragraphs deleted or amended when we read in an annual European Parliament report, for such a thin and urgent issue as the protection of human rights, paragraphs where they are proposed that they are ""not imprisoned,of the Member States to ""reduce the age of the minor's consent on homosexual relations"";We should fight against pornography, against the widespread pedophilia, against the marketing of men and women for sexual exploitation, against sexual tourism, always at the expense of minors.

"Thousands of deaths and wounded, are tens of thousands of refugees not enough to justify it?The second country, and I will be very brief about it, because Mr. Patten knows it very well, it is Burma.It is not tolerable that we were silent about Burma.I have the impression that this country slowly falls into oblivion.It has been ten years since an elected president has been assigned to be under house arrest.Parliament has not been working for ten years.Many deputies have been murdered or fled and only a small number still resident in Burma.Hundreds of thousands of refugees from Burma are found in Thailand and India, and yet it looks like we no longer pay attention to this country.I find that following the upheavals in Indonesia, Burma should be given to the agenda, too.It is still not acceptable that Ms. Aung San Su Kyi feels completely abandoned, especially by Europe.My request is that this country is also put back at the forefront of our priorities.Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman in office of the Council, Mr. Commissioner, the economic power of the European Union cannot constitute the only decisive element of his affirmation in the world.What distinguishes us is the systematic reference to human rights, both with us and in those with whom we have relationships.The European Parliament has been at the center of the promotion and defense of human rights, which seek to go beyond the limits of selfishness and ""national interests"" which sometimes result in the positions of the Member States and even other institutions of the European Union.This is why we can say, for example, that the European Parliament has never forgotten the situation in East Timor, which could have been the worst enemy of a just solution for its people, which has always opposed the Indonesian occupation.This is why we still recently opposed the sale of weapons to Indonesia, a position whose council unfortunately did not take into account.But it is not enough to avoid or put an end to revolting situations by people or institutions, against the weakest.The authors of offenses must not remain unpunished, whoever it is, wherever they are, in Indonesia, in Angola, in Cuba, in China or in Burma, whether it is a civil or a soldier, a soldier, a general or a minister.Justice must be done in Indonesia.Justice must be done in East Timor.President Wahid needs our support to deal with the difficult situation he inherited.It was at the initiative of the PPE that Parliament included at the time an express reference in East Timor in this resolution.There are officials for what happened in this country, of which I was partly the witness as a representative of the Parliament, and they cannot remain unpunished."	fr
However, I think that we should do everything to limit the transport of dangerous goods as much as possible, and this in all countries, whether they are regions of transit or not.Mr. President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Koch, of his magnificent work and his positive collaboration with the Commission to improve texts, present this report and this proposal;In the end, only an amendment was presented, which relates to the requirements applicable to the aptitude examination of security advisers for road transport, by rail or by the navigable of dangerous goods.We believe that collaboration, common work on the part of the two Parliament and Commission institutions is important and that the cooperation that exists with the regional policy commission, and concretely with the transport group, is magnificent.The common position includes practically all the amendments accepted by the Commission, harmonizes the minimum requirements applicable to the examinations of security advisers and, second reading, we can accept the proposed date, much more realistic than that projected at the start by the Commission, knowing that this has already been debating this question for several years.Very briefly, I would also like to thank the various deputies for their interventions and say that security is a priority of the commission in the field of transport.As Mr. Simpson said, it should never be considered that the process is acquired, that it has resulted.The process of increasing margins, safety guarantees in transport is a process that should be improved day after day.In this sense, I would also like to tackle the problems of the tunnels very briefly, to which MM.Rack and Swoboda have referred, and which, in the case of Austria, undoubtedly constitute a very sensitive subject, which is why it is necessary to make efforts to see how to increase their security.During one of the major accidents that occurred lately, the goods transported was not dangerous in itself.Margarine and a few pounds of painting which did not present any risks, caused a real disaster.It is therefore necessary to study the way in which the requirements can be adjusted even more in order to guarantee maximum security.Finally, I would like to say that it is necessary to approach the safety of all types of transport.This week, we will organize a debate here to talk about the security of maritime transport, following the Erika disaster, and we will have to discuss objectives throughout this year in terms of security, air transport.But I want to say, ladies and gentlemen, that security is a priority objective of the Commission.As I will say during the debate on Erika, we do not expect that a disaster occurs to devote body and soul to the aspect of security, but we work on it on the sidelines of these circumstances, which only highlight the urgency of an effective response to this type of problem.	fr
Mr President, I want to say a couple of words to Schüssel. Schüssel is a man who has a respectable past in European politics. He is now going to ride the government on the back of a political tiger. Good Schüssel - You are accepting a very serious, personal, national and European task. That task you, Schüssel, now accepts, is to respect the letter and spirit of the Community Treaties. Finally, I would say that this debate affects the core of our democratic values ​​and institutions and restores to our mind that the price of freedom is eternal alert. From all the places in the world on this mainland, which has experienced disgusting racism and suffer from the past at such an expensive price, we must emphasize that today's debate is not interfering with the sovereign rights of a state. This democratically selected Union institution must stubbornly emphasize that we do not allow European to turn the clock backwards.(Strong applause) Mr President, we could have discussed the necessity of strengthening the basic principles of the Union so that we could together defend them;Instead, we need to assign formal and content errors made in recent days. We consider it disgusting the political stubbornness of those people who, with uncomfortable speeches, have strengthened Haider's position in Austria and made the Union laughing at the legs of Article 7 of the Treaty, and reporting on anti -constitutional procedures. We have never had to participate in such a serious and rough interference in the internal affairs of a Member State before. Of course, the basic values ​​of Europe cannot be abandoned, and for this issue, the Prime Minister of the Italian government has declared that these principles are included in a agreement: he mentioned the Copenhagen Treaty that I do not know - as any of you - because there is no one. Perhaps he referred to the Amsterdam Treaty, which lists in Article 6, and Article 7, a procedure that can be stated that the Member State is seriously and continuously violating the principles referred to in Article 6. So far, however, there has been nothing more serious in Austria and any continuous violation. Not only is the chairman's statement not only intervene in the matters of the Member State, but it is also discriminatory, as it gives the right to punish one people and prohibit the right to choose who to vote. So far, there has been no political cohesion, even in the fight against organized crime or defending the victims of genocide;There has been no stable currency or economy that could actually combat unemployment and poverty;Still, the credibility of the Union has been destroyed in a minute with a rage that is characteristic of the folk. Sanctions may be imposed if agreements have been violated, but not when a democratically elected party is taken into the government. How else could we react to the communist states where the Communists are elected: Do we get them out of the Union if the Communists are taken to the government, or is Stalin's heir everything allowed?(Applaudes from the right) The institutions can earn respect and make others respect their principles only through diplomacy, persuasion, culture and solidarity, not by threatening, nor using anti -constitutional means. Bilateral relations concern states and therefore 14 Member States have nothing to do with them. Here, the European institutions are tagged to defend politically biased mindset with inability to be characterized by parties that have just been released from totalitarian systems and do not represent democratic traditions. Many, too many things distinguish us from Haider - as we have written many times - among his completely Italian Alto Adige requirements. This is what we knew: Now we have to say that other members of the Union seem to have given up its democratic role. We support legality and democracy expressed by peoples and respect for national self -determination as long as it does not infringe the principles or human rights of the Treaty.	fi
Report Böge (A5-0023/2000) as a member of the European Member and above all as a citizen and consumer, I welcome the European Commission's proposal, which represents a further step towards better nutritional security within the European Union.This proposal has two sides.On the one hand, it is about changing the 1991 guideline's directive with regard to the health police requirements by abolishing the provisions regarding the daring disease in sheep;On the other hand, a new regulation is intended to enter into force with which the regulations for contraception and combating certain transmissible spongegormarmorer encephalopathies (TSE) or diseases of the type BSE that affect sheep and other animal species are determined.The meaning of these new regulations is that in this way one creates a special legal basis for combating the travure disease in sheep.With this result, I am all the more satisfied than it was one of our most important demands that we had formulated in our BSE followers.In my opinion, it is essential that for reasons of coherence, we are incorporated into a single comprehensive system of new regulations for the TSE, which are limited to trading in trade with sheep and goats, which relate to all animals throughout the European Union and should guarantee protection against contaminated foods and animal feed.This regulation is all the more to be welcomed than there are still ambiguities with regard to the daring disease in sheep.Some scientific hypotheses assume that the trotting disease could be a pre-stage of BSE in cattle and thus the origin of the BSE disease.Even if the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and the Council for contraception and combating certain TSE must still be specified and expanded - in particular with regard to the recording and combating of the trotting disease - it represents a considerable improvement. This is a subfolite for European citizens who have often expressed their concern in view of European politics in the food sector.Her concerns that our European Parliament took up were heard.The European Commission caused the debates on the precautionary principle as well as questions of traceability, responsibility and transparency to publish a white book on food safety.This white book shows several considerations, and above all it suggests the creation of an independent European food authority.All of this is part of a European strategy to regain the trust of consumers.Now, the European managers, we have to prove that the internal market and free transport of goods must be reconciled with food safety!Report Cederschiöld (A5-0008/2000) Mr. President, I voted for this recommendation for the redesign of copyright protection law because I consider this to be one of the most important areas of the activities of the European Parliament.In my opinion, the product of intellectual work is much more important than the finished constructions, the objective products that we can see and touch without any doubt, while spirit and science produce results that cannot be touched by hand, which are, however, invaluable.As a European community, we should therefore support them far more powerful, not only by the way of patent protection, but also by promoting and supporting the scientists, those who, using their knowledge, do everything for future generations to offer much more than we used to have.In principle, we are against the fact that the European Community concludes contracts for copyrights on behalf of the Member States.	de
"Coherence, uniformity and universal good quality standards in a decentralized financial control system are guaranteed by a range of measures.One of them is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no general management can take charge of the financial control only for condition and as long as the audit service is absolutely convinced of the robustness of this system.Another measure is the establishment of a central financial service, as will note the honorable parliamentarians when reading the white paper, in order to ensure that these standards are set up and supervised.And there is also the theoretical and practical approach relating to an effective and independent internal audit service.In a parliamentary response of this type, I will not enter into all the details, but I am sure that on the exam, Ms. Theato will be able to see that the details of the White Paper give us strong guarantees.It will also be demonstrated that we have taken into account representations in this assembly, and especially within the budget control commission, which is significant with regard to the use of ex ante visas in general departments.The ex ante system can be used if we consider, in a general management, that this is an important and effective means of improving financial control.Naturally, there are several requirements within the Commission which depend on the number and nature of the financial transactions carried out by each general management.The white paper takes into account this too but when you want or when it is obviously necessary to use such a system, it must certainly be used.Last point, the transition.I share Ms. Theato's reservations on the said ""Sweet Legal Standard"".We have already had this discussion and she knows that I distinguish between different forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and which can ultimately be transformed into what we could call ""severe legal standard"".But, in this case, there is no place in my opinion for the ""gentle legal standard"", and that is why, in the transition period, there will be total adhesion to the current financial regulations until this law is changed by a democratic process in good and due form, within this assembly and the Council.The white paper guarantees this completely and it contains arrangements to do this.In addition, however, and this is very important because it is a transition period, there will be training, advice, support, guarantees and the new audit unit head will fully enter on May 1.With all this and a number of other guarantees, I think we can also be convinced that it is possible to be that the system will be completely safe even during the transition period.I have to make two other remarks because this is an essential question, at the CUR of the reform.My first remark is that citizens think - for reasons that I understand very well - that this transition has risks either irresponsibility or inertia."	fr
This shows who is willing to vote for the legally dubious retroactive character of the measure that would be expensive for future car buyers and would be a devastating blow to the European automotive industry.President, values, colleagues!I would like to briefly address the economic consequences of this guideline again and express my support for the amendments brought by my colleague Bernd Lange, since they have the advantage - and I would particularly like to underline this point - to reconcile environmental requirements and economic necessities.The common point of view of the council said that the vehicle manufacturers have to cover the costs for the withdrawal and recycling for the whole.However, as Mr. Lange explained so aptly, this solution would strongly disadvantage European manufacturers.I come from a country where cars are built and can tell them that it would be impossible to retrospectively impose the entire financial responsibility for all vehicles of their brand, which are currently still in operation, i.h.the coverage of the costs for 80 % of the European vehicle stock.This solution is unacceptable, because these manufacturers did not have the option of involving the environmental requirements that we today prescribe to them in their manufacturing processes and their cost.Due to the common point of view, the European vehicle manufacturers get into an unfavorable situation compared to the manufacturers who have been pregnant to the European market.Of course, it is not our job to defend this or that national interest to defend this or that industrial lobby, but rather our task is to defend the competitiveness of Europe on the world market and jobs in the sectors in which we are really competitive.Therefore, I ask you to support the values ​​that are supported by Bernd Lange Lange, which are also supported by the faction of the European Social Democrats, since they actually bring about all concerns - the economic interests and environmental requirements - to the Member States in which they want to implement these requirements, because these change applications already provide for the existing systems- some of which work quite well - can be maintained.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, the proposal of a guideline about old vehicles with whom we deal with today is directed to secure a high level of environmental protection in the Union and, on the other hand, to ensure the smooth functioning of the internal market.I would like to briefly mention that historical vehicles and classic cars naturally have to be removed from the scope of the directive, because I think we all agree that they belong to our cultural heritage.However, there are u. A.For Article 12, d.h.to the date from which the guideline applies.The solution proposed by the parliament, i.e.h.18 months after the entry into force of the guideline for first -time vehicles, is hardly realistic.The European vehicle stock includes dozens of millions of cars that have to be withdrawn without the recycling requirements being taken into account in their design.The common point of view would be more practical because it provides for the already approved vehicles in 2006.	de
I find that the official council president is willing to answer everything, but I have to wake up that inquiries are made in this session and answers.Mr. Rübig has the word.President, fourteen Member States, have imposed bilateral sanctions against a Member State because a democratically elected government was formed there.Both parties have already been involved in the government.To date, there are no violations of the law.Are preventive sanctions compatible with the human rights chart?Would a veto law of the council chairman in the event of national government formation with the fundamental rights chart?Is the call to violent demonstrations compatible with the Fundamental Charter?Mr. MP!As an incumbent Council President, I cannot give you an answer, for the simple reason, because the Portuguese Prime Minister's opinion on the name of fourteen heads of state and government of the Member States of the European Union at a bilateral level and not as President of the European Union.However, I would like to say that the complex of preventive measures that these Member States of the European Union have carried out at a strict bilateral level includes steps that, I would say, have a politically preventive character on a diplomatic level.We consider them to be fully justified and believe that they are accommodating what would be appropriate compared to the occurrence of a party and representatives of a party, which - so - as a party involved in a government of the European Union, does not give us any guarantees that they can fulfill the goals of the Union.I do not want to go into this topic on behalf of the President of the European Union, because this is about an intervention by my government, which has taken place at the request of fourteen Member States and in cooperation with them and not as a chair of the European Union.Mr President, I have the honor of belonging to the group that draws on the charta, and I will therefore not ask for the council to make conjectures about the content of the charter or to provide information about whether the charter should receive a programmatic character or legal binding.I would like to know what happens to the draft of the Charter that the working group creates.Will the Council see this draft as a document that it has to accept in the present form or reserves the right to change this document at will?Will the Council of this document simply approve or reject, or will it have the right to revert the draft of the charter?The answer is neither yes nor.I don't know, Mr Member, that will depend on the decision that is made at the council level.Inquiry No. 8 of (H-0042/00): concerns: The granting of export loan and their role in connection with the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey at the G8 meeting in Cologne was asked to prepare the determination of common standards for the granting of export loans.These loans can be used in such a way that they distort the competition or that questionable projects are supported.Will the EU be predicted in a leading role in determining common standards?The British government's explanation recently showed that this would be necessary that it intended to grant an export loan involved in the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey.	de
"Sorry and reflection are already enough. Mr. Commission member, we all have to go to the matter and take action. First of all, the safety of marine transport - especially when it comes to carbon water and hazardous substances - requires effective control in the territorial waters and ports of the community. Construction of these vessels, their dual base, their age, classification facilities control, insurance, all necessary information -containing databases, cooperation and coordination of the community level, enhancement of inspectors' control, and the responsibility of carriers and cargo owners are issues that need to be dealt with, and the European Commission is best to make real proposals. Also, convenience tickets - which also cause so much harm to fishing that we have started talking about ""responsible fishing"" - we need to monitor and regulate especially for transportation. The access of ships sailing under the comfort flag of a comfort flag must be monitored to the community waters that do not comply with community safety standards. We expect concrete acts from the European Commission. As far as fishing and aquaculture areas, which are particularly important, advanced and respected, especially in the areas of the Bretagne and La Vendée damaged in the accident, it is important that the European Commission informs about the damage caused, the assessment it has made, and any kind of special measures that it has intended to take - political, economic, social, and so on. Damage and to compensate fishermen and companies to the dramatic losses they have experienced overnight. How do we restore consumer confidence in the area of ​​the area? How can we compensate for damage to the victims of the accident? This is a very serious problem that the European Union - the economic, commercial, industrial and fishing - cannot be allowed. Member of the Commission, we must access the work. We must be pioneers and advanced on these issues that ruin our environment and devastately influence companies and practicing. It must be taken to prevent preventive measures to prevent such disasters anymore. This is the purpose of all the oral question we asked for all the colleagues of the Fisheries Committee. We look forward to hearing concrete suggestions from the Commission: activities instead of apologies. Mr President and Dear Members, Parliament is likely to accept a joint resolution of several parliamentary groups, which I think is very important and favorable. The Mr President, the Erika tanker's shipwreck on the coast of Bretagne on December 12, created an oil plate, whose environmental impact will suffer for years. Not only did the accident destroyed natural resources, it had serious consequences for some areas of the economy, especially in fishing areas. The situation may still be worse, as the sinking ship still has 20,000 tonnes of crude oil. The consequences have been very serious for aquaculture and oyster farming sectors that have not been able to defend themselves to the coast inevitably the contamination;Not only because of the immediate pollution of the first days, but also because their market quota has decreased and consumers have abandoned products that have all security shots but indirectly affected by contamination. Good members, these are remote areas whose unstable economy has been significantly affected by this oil ferry, and unfortunately is not a single case. The main funds in these areas - and also other neighboring areas are just natural resources. Too often, this nature has suffered from human activity, and this could have been avoided if the authorities had been faster and had better control. The proverb also says it is better to prevent the traces in advance, and the budget says so. Good members, prevention is very advantageous compared to the price of such disasters. Fischler, a member of the Commission, says he is present whenever his parliament calls him. However, in the case of Erika, as a member of the Commission, he has given the impression, maybe not for us, but yes, to the residents of Bretagne and La Vené, that he is not present or is only part-time."	fi
This view seems to be partially echoed by the common position adopted by the British Socialist Presidency. This position is foolish or, as we talk about water, I would say it is going everywhere. That is why we have seen such a flood of amendments by the Environment Committee: nearly 200 amendments for the second reading. This is rarely the case, but most amendments are absolutely essential to clog the holes from where water is burning. Such a large hole is due to dangerous chemicals. The chemical industry, but unfortunately the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, wish to carry out a separate risk analysis for each of the dangerous substances. This is extremely time -consuming, and there is no acceptable level of pollution from dangerous chemicals. It is only acceptable the level of pollution that exists in the depths of the ocean, that is, almost zero. The Commission already has a list of 32 substances of direct priority. Many of these substances disrupt hormonal function: these are the so -called endocrine suppressors. Even in minimal quantities these substances cause genetic mutations in animals and humans, as scientists are increasingly seeing. That is why it is so important for the European Parliament to take a position in order to achieve the OSPAR contract to reduce these substances to zero almost 2020. Let me refer to two of the substances included in the Commission's list. These are mercury and trivutiltin, known as TBT. At the bottom of the Wadden Sea, in the Netherlands, mercury and TBT levels are 10 and 1000 times higher than OSPAR levels. The chemical industry and society as a whole must find ways to replace these dangerous chemicals by harmless substitutes and until then use them in closed systems. For TBT this means that it should no longer be used to combat algae growth. Mechanical cleaning of ship walls is a good alternative. I would like to conclude the hope that the European Parliament regain its green image and to take a stand in favor of achieving the reduction of dangerous substances and endocrine repressive at almost zero levels by 2020. Mr President, Parliament has a substantial role in the process of processing it. In many areas the common position of the Council is absolutely inadequate. That is why our duty must now be to make the conditions of the directive meaningful and specific. Some principles were especially important to us, the members of the Confederate team of the European Union Left - left of the northern Greens of the Northern Countries, when we took a position on the various proposals. First of all, we consider that the time frameworks for the implementation of the proposal measures compared to those proposed by the Council should be more limited, and therefore we support the proposals requesting the shortcuts of the deadlines for the implementation of various skeletons of the Directive. Secondly, I wish for the gradual removal of dangerous substances to be governed by consistency. There should be no delays because new evaluation conditions will be made before measures are taken.	el
The other principle of the common point of view of the council in the draft guideline has a retroactive character.However, it contradicts all generally recognized economic and legal principles to retrospectively impose a financial responsibility for its product.He would also change the responsibility for the owner retrospectively, because a consumer may have changed the product in various ways over the years.In all Member States of the EU there are currently laws that regulate the scrapping of cars.These are either better or worse from country to country.In the expectation of the implementation of this EU directive, however, every state in the Union should regulate the disposal of old vehicles as best as possible, so that the EU regulations do not receive any retrospective validity.This does not conflict with a financing model through fund formation.Mr. President, the importance of the present guideline for the environment and the economy is obvious and is generally recognized.The common point of view represents a compromise that is quite difficult and quite difficult and on shaky feet, so that, as not to endanger the entire directive, there are only very limited scope for improvements.I therefore claim that the parliament must not force anything, and it would be paradoxical if this would do so in the sense of reducing the environmental scope of the directive.I remind you that the vehicle manufacturers have granted to be able to live with the guideline;The costs are not excessively high: the disposal of a car costs less than 1 % of the purchase price of a new vehicle.In addition, the financial responsibility of the manufacturers only comes into force in 2006, so a large part of the currently present vehicles will no longer be on the market;For the remaining vehicles, a form of the cost allocation could be provided, as proposed in the changes in the Lange, which I have brought in Lange, which in my opinion are the only one with the balance of the common point of view and with experience in some countries and must therefore be supported.President, that is an extremely bad guideline.First of all, as my colleague Mr. Bowis found, she has a retroactive character, and that is basically wrong.Secondly, she has huge costs for the European automotive industry, which would have a negative impact on competitiveness and labor market.We are constantly talking about the European labor market in this parliament, and yet we constantly say goodbye to measures that make the number of jobs drop.In my opinion, the guideline is also bad in other ways, which has not yet been sufficiently discussed in this debate.It is like many European regulations.It is far too normative.She bindingly prescribes a specific model of recycling.The assembly line was invented by Henry Ford about a hundred years ago, and we practically suggest the establishment of a assembly line as in the 19th century, only that it runs backwards and dismantled vehicles and the individual assemblies are dismantled for recycling.However, we should stop briefly and think that the sales opportunities of recycled bumpers are extremely uncertain.The plastics industry does not want to get these products back and cannot afford to take back economically at all.There is already a very successful industry that browsing cars, reclining metals and generating energy by burning the non -metal parts.	de
As a member of the Parliament, he is remarkably skilled and has pushed through his affairs vigorously and convincingly. However, he underestimates his share in this debate, because with what he and others have done, we have come to a situation that can be considered a mediation solution in the name of reasonableness. Those who deny this and say that we are still in the stalemate will, in fact, admit it, as well as those who wish to reject a common position in tomorrow's vote that they do not want this directive to be born at all. They do not want vegetable fats to be added in any Member State, in any form, to any product to be called chocolate. This position is not a majority of Member States and consumers of the European Union for a moment, and I want to spend my short speech time to defend the opposite position. If we go to harmonization based on zero levels of vegetable fats, what has always been presented in campaigning, we will be able to safeguard consumers, raw material producers and, above all, for those standards we have set for ourselves in the European Union. With a few approved exceptions, the reviews submitted on the Environment Committee were destructive. They sought to postpone all kinds of resolution of this parliament and this Commission as a whole and cannot be accepted. They required the introduction of the impact studies before the directive itself may enter into force, or all kinds of extra stitches, in addition to the dual entry required by this proposal to consumers. My group supports a common position with a few exceptions, and they will certainly come to light during this discussion. We believe they are a good thing for consumers. They receive a wider product range and separate and clear markings. They are a good thing for all vegetable fat producers, and I include cocoa butter in these fats. Cocoa butter is the most important ingredient in any kind of chocolate, and will continue to be, even for those who have produced natural vegetable fats, the list of which can only be changed on the basis of and with its consent. If I came from Burkina Faso or Malo or a country that produces butter oil, and I would be told that butter nuts that are an integral part of the women's cooperatives collecting in Europe will be boycotted or endangered because they are considered to be multicanagient companies, I would be very angry. I show the last words that I have time to say, to quality chocolate manufacturers in Belgium and some other areas that use special methods in manufacturing. Quality speaks for itself. You can get a claim for additional entries if you wish. It does not affect the eating chocolate of people like me, but we want people to have the wide range of products that adds cocoa and added vegetable fats to the European Union. Mr President, an average citizen who hears about this conversation on this Chocolate Directive, is already starting to lip his lips as he thinks of all kinds of delicacies. Chocolate is a ingredient, unfortunately. As a new member of the Parliament, I consider the burden how long this topic has been discussed, and I cannot get rid of the impression that chocolate has brought anything but enjoyment to the Parliament. This path of suffering has been completed today. There are many parties in this debate. There are cocoa producers, vegetable oil producers, NGOs, chocolate producers and many more. They are all interesting. However, when it comes to me, the most important thing is the consumer. I think the most interesting principle is that the consumer has freedom of choice. As politicians in this regard, we must be careful. After all, you should not argue about the taste. The European Parliament cannot and may not prescribe harmonized euro flavor. For us, there is no need to put printed warning texts in the lighting neon letters in front of the chocolate packaging. Chocolate and cigarettes are not a similar thing. Of course, there are other benefits that need to be paid attention to. For example, we need to pay attention to the uncertain situation in the countries where the ingredients of chocolate come from.	fi
"Nothing less and nothing more than the presence in the government of a Member State of a political power, whose doctrine and authorities are not in line with the conceptual and moral foundations that govern the union and are established in its founding conditions. A simple reading of Article 1 of Chapter 4 of the Austrian Liberal Party's political program shakes every democratic consciousness. To perceive the ethnic element as the decisive factor of a nation and the confirmation of a nation's supremacy over the rest, as stated in the article, awakens old nightmares of a century that we have just left behind and some historians described it to the century of horrorSurprised our eyes. Of course, the Austrian people are dominant, and of course we must respect the principle of non -involvement in the internal affairs of a Member State. But the problem is not there. The problem is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State that includes a party with such characteristics. Our answer to this crucial question is no.(Applause) In addition to any strategic or tactical calculations, beyond the possible discharge given to alien behaviors, beyond and above party interests or electoral contexts, the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party Group of Parliament, in full with the Spanish Party and the Spanish Party.of the Portuguese Presidency at the Council of January 31 that passed us, with its content, its tone and its importance.(Applause) Conrad Adenauer had once said - and he knew what he was saying - that the safest way to calm a tiger is to allow her to devour you. History is the summary of those things that could have been avoided. Consequently, Madam President, dear colleagues, the Union and the House must send a clear message to the public that they reject the tiger of non -tolerance, xenophobia and totalitarianism, so as not to add another error to the long list of outbreaks and resignation.(Vivid applause) Madam President, dear colleagues, our union was created around this idea: ""Never again.""And this was implied ""never again xenophobia, concentration camps, anti -Semitism, never nationalist outbursts, never again wars"". The meaning of the European Union is none other than the willingness to transcend this horrible story of the twentieth century, which in the heart of Europe killed every humanitarian ideal and remains extremely timely today. It is not true that since a government is allied with neo -fascists, somewhere in Europe, this is only a problem of national sovereignty, since our union is not made up of states - nations that have been quoted and that concludes agreements with each other to improve their fate. It is a common destiny where, when the fundamental is disputed, when the values ​​are at stake, we must all be pregnant with all the Democrats together to find solutions so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past."	el
Unfortunately, I miss the indication of the associated standards.I wonder where they took these standards and values ​​from.In my opinion, the Bible, the Word of God, is the only pure source of demanding standards and real values.This knowledge, which has grown in the tradition of our continent, is a crucial element that deserves due recognition.Ms. President, Mr Commission President, ladies and gentlemen!I don't know what to stick to - to the strategic goals 2000 to 2005 or to your speech 2000 to 2010?Have you already included your second term?But seriously.The expanding union needs strengthening through slimming and limitation.First, slimming.What you say in your program for concentration on the core tasks of the Commission can only be a very first beginning.The activities of the entire Union must be attributed to the core areas of politics.These are the social and ecological orientation of the market, the securing of the currency, the guarantee of civil rights internally and the representation of the common interests to the outside world.It is not only important to speak to one voice in the world, but it depends much more about what we want to say with this voice.Second, the new buzzword is called flexibility.But out of increasing flexibility, or threatens to become intergovernmentalization very quickly.We have to stick to the clinging of the Member States through joint decision -making organs.Incidentally, this also applies to the inclusion of civil society, which is welcome.However, the citizens do not need new organs or institutions and certainly no new mixing of responsibilities.(Applause) Transparency is no longer access to more paper, but transparency for citizens is finally more clarity about who, when, what with what justification in Brussels and Strasbourg.This is transparency!Third, the European Union cannot and must not expand without limitations.Their limits do not arise from the question of how many states want, but how many they can cope with.(Applause) If the price for the expansion were the softening or even the resolution of the existing Union, it should not be paid.It would be too high, by the way, not only for the Member States that are in it, but also for the states that want to be included in this Union.A Union only as a geostrategic concept has no future, just as little as a Union that is only a mere free trade zone.However, the Union remains more than a market and only receives its legitimation from the peoples of Europe if it sees itself as a community of fate.This is much more than just her new economic and socio -political agenda or a new and better quality of life.Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament, but also the peoples and states in our European Union, will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and act together.It is no less than about reinventing the European Union without destroying the existing one!(Applause) Mrs. President!According to the Group of Liberal and Democratic Party in Europe, the most important task of the Commission and the entire Union is in a successful implementation of the expansion.	de
"At the same time, financial support via the flagship program can also be essential.However, EU's policy in the Balkans is today fragmentary, inorganized and contradictory.There are different types of agreements or relationships - or lack of relationships - which lead to the embargo in Yugoslavia and which create a fragmented and ineffective approach.It lacks the notion of regionalization for the Balkans, who understands everyone without exclusions and without a spirit of revenge.Finally, it is necessary and it is useful that the European Union intervenes for the resolution of the problem of the name of the ARYM, which, unfortunately, extends and can lead to more lively tensions.Likewise it is necessary and it is useful that it intervenes for a more active management and limited in time with regard to the negotiations of the ARYM authorities..The will expressed by the Commission to strengthen relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and to open up to the latter the prospect of full integration into the community, seems to us to respond to a priority concern: the construction of a political whole respectful of nations and their sovereignty could not postpone the sending of a sign to these states of southern EuropeEnd of the Second World War, did not spare.After being crushed by the triumphant communism boot, the region has not ended, since the early 1990s, to pay the addition of the collapse of the Soviet system.However, in this difficult context, and more particularly since the NATO military intervention in the Balkans, some of these states, all authentically European, have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which makes their aspirations in integration into the community legitimate.As such, the case of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both exemplary and emblematic.Exemplary, because it proves that the states of the Balkans are not struck by any fatality and that they are, for those who have the will, today able to meet the usual requirements of the stabilization and association agreements required by the European Union.Emblematic, because it positively illustrates the fifteen project to see a common policy in the five countries of the region (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, ARYM and ALBANIE) which would make economic and political stabilization an ardent and urgent obligation.The Uen group is all the more agreement with the sending of this signal to the old Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as it gives its place to independence and sovereignty of the States: if one cannot identify a satisfactory solution in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states that compose them, it could not be questioned thattried unworthy of such a promotion.The Union is in its role when it seeks by its cooperation policy to encourage nations to marry with it a base of common values ​​whose democracy and freedom of citizens are the cornerstone.It leaves it when it replaces the peoples in its choices, or that failing this, it reinvents a new form of ""sense of history"" which does not understand the notion of self -determination of peoples than in one way."	fr
The majority of MPs in this parliament do not want this situation, but we have to be careful when choosing our means so that we do not achieve the opposite of what we want to achieve.Ms. President, dear colleagues!I reject all explanations, statements or feelings of xenophobia or racism.I defend the good of human rights and the rule of law that Europe has.But that is precisely why I do not agree to the nonsensical actions that were initiated by the presidency (unfortunately the Portuguese presidency) in a real institutional false handle on behalf of the other fourteen countries.This is not the way to combat extremism.It can even be a way where he is still shown to be very welcome.The flood of confused and rushed measures that you have started against Austria messes up everything without meaning and mind, leads to great uncertainty among the honest citizens and harbors dangers that have not been taken into account.There is an insurmountable contradiction between positions that have been represented in the name of the preservation of human rights and the rule of law, which at the same time violate the fundamental rights of the Austrians and the decisive rules of the rule of law, in this case the norms of the contracts.What ultimately want to achieve when we make our way to a government conference?A Europe of 27 or a Europe of 14 or an even smaller Europe?For Europe, for a Europe, all the steps that led us here are honored, for a Europe that pays attention to the contracts and the right, for a Europe in which Austria is needed.That must be said!Ms. President, I am happy and proud that this parliament, with an overwhelming majority, condemned the formation of a coalition government in Austria, including Mr. Haider.In the past few years, Mr. Haider has proven that he deserves exclusion from normal democratic discourse.He not only admired Adolf Hitler, who praised Waffen-SS and refused to condemn a terrorist bomb attack, in which four Roma died, he is also a member of the regional government of Carinthia.He spoke in favor of the abolition of measures in favor of the Slovenian minority in Austria and to support immigrants.Some said we didn't have the right to interfere in Austria's politics.You are wrong.The European contracts oblige us to protect fundamental rights.Some said that we have to accept the results of democratic elections.But democratic elections are far from turning democrats out of those who threaten democracy.The tragedy of the Holocaust, which cost six million Jews, resulted in the same argument against Germany in the 1930s.But we shouldn't judge Mr. Haider for his ambition.He won't change on this point.The real culprits are Austria's Christian Democrats who have become Judas and have had a threat to Europe resurrected, which we believed that it had perished in Berlin in 1945.	de
As the Commission member Patten said, in this context, for us who support the idea, it is therefore important that it creates an open and democratic state. We all want to work for it. Mr President, at first I would like to refer to a common resolution, which will be given at the end of this discussion and to which my group has been influenced and naturally accepted. However, in particular, I want to announce that we are delighted that Israel and Syria will discuss again after such a long time to solve their difference in opinion. Recent negotiations are now a significant step towards permanent peace in the Middle East. Therefore, it is also unfortunate that these peace negotiations were so far postponed. Indeed, both parties need to make a lot of effort. Permanent peace in that area can only be carried out when a contract is brought about to guarantee the safety of Israel's borders and the integrity of Syria. In this case, it is also necessary to start lasting diplomatic relationships and continuous dialogue. In addition to having bilateral meetings in Israel and Syria, I hope that Israel will also launch negotiations with Lebanon in the near future and that, within the context of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will be possible. However, it is still unfortunate that the European Union, one of the most important contributors to financial assistance, is still unable to take on a significant political role in the peace process. This Middle East peace process is one of the priorities of the common foreign and security policy of the European Union. It reserves a special role for Solani, a high representative of the Council. In addition, the Commission and Member States must be encouraged to support projects that can help create understanding and cooperation between different peoples in the area. I also have to refer to the importance of the Barcelona process. It must have a positive impact on regional cooperation. In this sense, we support Libya's participation on the condition that it recognizes human rights, promises to abandon terrorist support, and fully support the peace process. It goes without saying that there is still a lot of unresolved problems and questions without answers to the Palestinians. Everyone knows that the peace process is a long and difficult process, but we are convinced that our common goals, a peaceful and well-off Middle East are achieved through the necessary trust and the necessary political will and perseverance. Mr President, it is gratifying that the peace talks between Israel and Palestinian and Israel and Syria are underway, despite a few delays and problems. The moment of truth is approaching. Is Israel ready to follow the UN resolutions and to hand over the Arab regions he had conquered in 1967 to compensate for peace and safety? Will Israel allow the Palestinian refugees return to their territories or does it give them compensation? Does Israel share the water of Israel Jerusalem and the Jordan River with others? Will the free Palestine become a completely democratic state and thus a reliable peace partner? Does Syria fully accept the existence of Israel and will introduce democracy and the principles of the rule of law. The fact that the main responsibility for the peace process is occupying in Israel does not mean that the Arabios side also has a great part of their responsibility. However, peace in the Middle East applies to all of us. Therefore, it is good that the EU acts as a godfather of the Palestinian state. Against this background, I would like to end my speech by telling a remarkable story of the EU Member State of Sweden. There, Hitler is held for the destruction of the Jews, an international inter -governmental conference, which is, of course, a positive initiative. However, among the 47 states of the world, there is no one of the Arab states that are part of the EU Barcelona process. This has been interpreted in such a way that Europeans believe that the Arab opinion of Israel should be treated in the same way as Nazi anti -Semitism, which is, of course, completely wrong. The criticism of the Arab world in Israel has been based on similar opposition to colonial power as, for example, Algeria's freedom battle against France. Today, however, Egypt, Jordan and Palestine have contracted peace with Israel.	fi
Mr President, good members of the Parliament, if they are adhered to even to some extent, the impartial approach, it can be stated that there is certainly no trace of racism in the broad center of the European Parliament. Although Parliament is arguing about the report on racism, it is not due to the prevailing racism in Parliament, but rather the report itself. For example, this report does not just say commendable issues about the opposition to racism, but deals with some topics such as the voting rights of third -country citizens in certain states or civil service, access to posts that can be decided or so, but have no little to do with racism. And it is for these statements that this report becomes a fraudulent wrapping - this is what I want to say clearly. The opposition of racism to which we are all committed to, are traded in this political little money and misused. Therefore, we do not support the report in its current form. I strongly oppose this kind of underestimation of racism, as it said in this way, a political controversy is made. We strongly criticize the procedure of this report. We all oppose racism. We all invest in resisting it. It would require a large majority of Parliament. But it does not happen that one of the Parliament has this concept and is a political struggle, but we must demand that such a subject be dealt with in a way that everyone can accept, and this is not the case in this case. Mr President, congratulations on all four rapporteurs for their work, and especially the Paronitar Ludford for the continuation of the work I was launched, among other things, in the first investigation of European racism and fascism almost 15 years ago. In fact, the presenter of that committee was one of the excellent member of the Christian Democratic group and Nea Dimocratic, Dimitrios Evregenis, whose work Le Pen has said that he strives to prevent it in every way. I would like to say two things about the reports we discussed;First of all, the Belder report contains a version of the review I submit to the treatment of a Russian -speaking minority in Estonia and Latvia. I think it is appropriate.15 years ago in Austria, Jörg Haider persuaded the country's Slovenian minority. At that time, very few of us wanted to comment on it. We need to tell the Estonians and the Latvians that if such treatment continues, their hopes of joining the European Union will decline. Secondly, the Ludford report includes several reviews of the Christian Democrats that questioned several points that were originally in the report of Evregenis 15 years ago - and which were approved by the Christian Democrats at the time - and concerning the amendment of personnel rules so that the representatives of the ethnic minority of the European Community. When it comes to voting rights and the choice of candidates representing ethnic minorities, I do not understand if they have no communal memory or - which would be even more ominous - whether their political position has changed. The Mr President, I, and my party group, were eager to support Harder's human rights report because we think its line is very good and there are many other good reasons. However, with my party group and I have very big doubts about Ludford's report, as it discusses a number of political measures that have nothing to do with the analysis under the guise of racism and alien hatred;In addition to them, of course, there are numerous other measures that we support without reservation. I also tell you what points we do not accept and why. We do not accept points extending beyond the given report period 1997/98. And if Sarah Ludford thinks that the report should deal with the year 2000, he should have gifts for a fortune teller, because this is just ahead of us. Secondly, we do not accept points that oppose the basic principle of solidarity.	fi
I have also submitted a resolution on behalf of the EDD group. Mr President, in recent years in the world, has repeatedly occurred serious tanker accidents, without having been taken into consideration or effective retaliation. This time, the situation is particularly bad, especially because it applies to a major European state;a case that can be repeated at any time. To limit these hazards, we urgently need the Directive. Previous 15 are obviously not enough. They guarantee - at least three things without demanding perfection: no scrapping tanker and cargo ship must never differ again in the port in the European Union. Any person concerned, including the commissioner of the transportation, are responsible for the consequences, and these concerned must take adequate insurance. Only in this way that the injuries have the opportunity to make claims for damages. However, it must be clear to us that the long -term goal is still to be supplemented. This means that we need the actual cost match for our entire energy management system. Mr President, I would like to start saying that I am very grateful to the Commission member Palacio for the clear, decent and very determined answer. Many thanks for that. This also means that in any case, I have a great value for a newsletter he sent on January 10, as well as the measures he announced today. Erika's disaster shows that when there are no proper traffic and transportation regulations at international and community level, nature and the environment will suffer from it. It is impossible to calculate the damage, including ecologically, in the money. That is why we also have this discussion with colleagues responsible for transportation and environmental issues. During the Christmas holidays, when the Dutch media drew attention to Erika's accident, I looked at the Internet, which could be taken, especially after Prime Minister Josp had said that the community had to do more. I understood that there was really enough legislation, but the problem is that there is no control. You allow me to bring up a couple of things that also briefly mentioned the Member of the Commission. Firstly, 25 % of all ships must be inspected in the audit activities of the port states. In my opinion, this 25 % share must be followed, but in addition, you also need to make sure that more inspections are carried out, ie this 25 % share must be increased. In addition, when a particular ship must no longer be in traffic, it is not enough to check the facts alone, but also have to be a legal system that is said to be said that going to traffic is not sensible or that you no longer have to leave at all. However, this is not the case. Mr President, in this case should take action. Then, in the end, as far as the technical demands on ships were concerned, my colleagues also talked about the fact that in the United States, ships had to always have a dual pasture since 1999. I think that we too have to get further in this matter and that the MARPOL agreement that enters into force in 2001 must be properly viewed. Mr President, then you have to critically examine the membership negotiations with Malta, and my thanks and admiration to those many NGOs who have in any case been effectively taken to rescue animals. Mr President, we have had this debate so often before. However, we have not achieved anything so far and we have neglected the opportunity to find a consensus in the European Union. Therefore, I believe in the meaning of today's debate only if what we all say today, and what you, the Member of the Commission, have stated here, will really find their way into legislation, that is, you all say to the principals of your governments and the ministry: This must be driven through the Council of Ministers. At first, let me say that we are talking about an environmental disaster, which also has economic effects and threatens to livelihood.	fi
Madame Rothe, I'm going to express myself as follows: I am convinced that the current context has improved to reach such agreements.I have no commitments at the moment.I do not wait for them either before we started direct discussions.They will come later.The context has changed that Helsinki's decisions made a large number of things finally possible and above all that the participants completely changed their political strategy.I have always thought that the old position, according to which Cyprus would only adhere once the political conflict has been regulated, received a weakness, in the sense that it did not convincing the Turkish Cypriot community to really get involved, because, faced with this strategy, the Turkish community had nothing else to do their arms and wait.The question of the membership of Cyprus would not have been raised.Now, the Turkish community must seriously count with the risk that Cyprus really integrates the European Union, with the growing prospects of well-being and security which result from it for the Greek community, while the Turkish community, already much less prosperous, would continue to be distant.I am therefore firmly convinced that the motivation to link the peace process to the settlement of the conflict has increased enormously from Helsinki.It was also the underlying idea.After a few weeks, it is still too early, Madam, to already deliver an assessment, but I have no reason to assume that the new course of action will fail.There is no reason for that.There is still no reason to say that we will succeed but I can really say that the conditions for progress have improved considerably.Last point, the Cypriot question obviously plays a role in discussions with Turkey.During my meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister a few weeks ago in Brussels, I naturally asked Turkey to adopt a positive and constructive attitude towards this issue.However, I issue the following reserve: we cannot be certain a hundred percent - in any case, I am not - that just press a button in Ankara so that everything works in Cyprus!It hasn't been as simple for a long time.Rather, we will have to strive, in our discussions with the two communities, to bring them to an agreement.This is what we do, we have funds and programs for this.I must clearly tell you that I need the financial regulations submitted to your decision so that we can start.Financial settlement is the legal framework to be able to address the priorities provided for in partnerships with Cyprus and Malta.I can't start without that, I miss the legal basis.If the so-called lack of consistency has any relationship with this specific point, I would like to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing else.	fr
I would like to know if the document that the committee has just presented provides for such a clause.Thank you very much, Inger Schörling.These are two important questions.I am happy to have the opportunity to clarify them.No, we should not start with a cost-benefit analysis, but to base ourselves on an evaluation of what we know, what science can teach us and how we must consider it in relation to the risks that we believe to exist for the environment or for the health of men and animals.On the other hand, when we have decided to take a certain measure, we must then choose one that has a good cost-effectiveness, so as not to adopt completely absurd measures from the point of view of efficiency.So do not start with a cost-benefit analysis.The other question concerns the reversal of the burden of proof.It is quite correct that we need to apply it in some cases.I took the case of the strategy with regard to chemicals as a good example of a domain where it is necessary.This is indeed this area, but we can say that this communication on the precautionary principle is horizontal;It concerns all specific political areas.This is the reason why it is not particularly a question of reversal of the burden of proof in this regard or what the burden of proof will look like, but it is rather the political decision-making and the foundations of it.However, it is absolutely exact that we must, for example, when it comes to chemicals, take care to obtain a reversal of the burden of proof.Mr. President, I think that, to function, the precautionary principle should be quite radical, otherwise we are constantly lost in the tortuous meanders of interpretations.Take an example: it is shown that an anticryptogamic product gives birth to blind children;He is therefore teratogenic.Very well, it is an anticryptogamic, an antimstotal.It is a British laboratory that has proven the teratogenic effect, the only one perhaps, however, to have done tests.Well, in my opinion, since the threat is also serious for health, the precautionary principle requires that the product is immediately withdrawn from trade, as did New Zealand for example.I would therefore like to ask the following question: when human health is at stake, or when serious effects on human health are possible, should we analyze costs and profits?A blind child is too high a price in my opinion, no profit could compensate for it.I would like to know if, ultimately, the precautionary principle as you understand it, the commissioner, would presuppose in this case that the product is removed from the sale until other laboratories provide the contrary.Mr. President, I am the first to hope that we can use the precautionary principle so that it is considered radical in terms of protecting men's health and the environment.	fr
The Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, for the second processing, can only accept one proposal for a revision proposed by Parliament. The Commission will accept and accept this proposal. (The President declared a common position as adopted in this way.) On the proposal of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourist Committee (A5-0104/1999) by Koch, on the proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council as Directive for Dangerous Member States on Dangerous Member States' approximation of the Directive 94/55/EC (1999)C5-0004/1999 1999/0083 (COD) (COD)) (Parliament approved the legislative decision statement)(Kom (1999) 344 C5-0122/1999 1999/2127 (Cos)) (Parliament approved the resolution.C5-0120/1999 1999/2123 (COS)) (Parliament approved the resolution.) The Commission of Finance and Monetary Affairs (A5-0069/1999) by the Commission of the Commission on the White Book of the EC Treaty 85 and 86-1999/2108 (COS)) (Parliament approved the resolution.) The report of the Finance and Monetary Affairs Committee (A5-0078/1999) about XXVIII (1998) (Sec (1999) 743 C5-0121/1999/2124 (Cos) (COS) (COS) ofresolution.) The Committee and Financial Committee report (A5-0087/1999) by Jonckheer, from the seventh overview of the European Union and some other disciplines (KOM (1999) 148 C5-0107/1999 1999/2110 (COS) (COS) (parliamentReport (A5-0073/1999) of the Commission's Report on Community Rules for State Support for Steel Industry 18 December 1996 Decision 2496/96/EHT (Steel Support Rules) in 1998 (Kom (1999) 94 C5-0104/1999/2107) (COS) (COS)resolution.) Voting statements- own assets. (FR) The European Union is seemingly funded in four of its own. In fact, the funds of the European budget have been obtained from VAT and GDP, especially after the abandonment of the community benefit and the increase in free trade areas collapsed the customs fees and the common agricultural fee, which had already been truncated to the common customs benefits. Fraud and distortion of the community's VAT on the calculation of GDP, which is a fourth source of taxation of a fourth source of funding, has since had a significant contribution to the accumulation and fairness of community funds. For the same reason, European funding for federalism makes it show it more than ever from an ordinary inter -governmental organization that it is, but which it does not want to be. This is clearly reflected in the regulation we are discussing. It is concerned about the accounting, implementation of their own funds, and monitoring the amount of payments that are proven to be used by the Commission. In addition, the new advisory committee consists of representatives of the tax-paying Member States. We are far from development towards community criminal law, the general prosecutor of the community, or the community police in the form of Olaf. In this context, there is no European federal tax yet. However, it is true that 25 Member States wants European income tax unless it is made to tax benefits or fund the 2025 budget for the CO2 tax. Koch's report (A5-0105/1999). (FR) I am very pleased with the report on the clearer harmonization of the training of dangerous material transportation security advisers. National and international transportation of hazardous substances has increased significantly in recent years, which has increased the risk of accidents. Some accidents are due to the fact that the risks associated with transport are not sufficiently known. Thus, if the internal market is realized, it has been necessary to take measures to ensure better risk prevention. Directive 96/35/EC was the answer to this claim. Companies caring for hazardous substances and companies involved in loading and demolition related to transport are reasonably obliged to comply with the rules for avoiding risks on roads, railways and inland waters. In order to make this goal easier, the Directive 96/35/EC provides for the appointment of safety advisers with appropriate training with appropriate training. The aim of the training of advisers should be to know the key laws, regulations and administrative regulations applicable to these transport.	fi
"I would like to view some points that my team emphasizes. Regarding the well -being of union citizens, the most important thing is to seek to maintain a sustainable economic growth in the territory of the Union, while at the same time ensuring that the equality of the regions in terms of prosperity and more and more people are gaining a good income from their own work. The procedures, which were launched by joint decisions, to improve employment, to enhance economic reform and to improve social solidarity in the union territory, are extremely important. It is right that the Lisbon Summit at the end of this month will indulge in our course. Despite the diversity of these processes, they should have one common purpose: to improve people's quality of life in the European Union. However, we do not need new shapes, new working groups or new forums to achieve this goal. The media are certainly known to everyone. However, often national views and sometimes ideological contradictions are the causes we do not use in these means. The most important thing now is to lift as quickly as possible the obstacles from creating a real European internal market, rather than still moving in the context of fifteen different internal markets in many areas. When in the 1980s we started promoting the idea of ​​the internal market vigorously, we could still, metaphorically, move towards the destination with the speed of local train with a locomotive. Now - that the advent of e -commerce is rapid and the speed of processing and using data transmission is at a completely different level - we need at least the car speed like Mika HDKKinen formula. We should, however, be sure that the ""driving force"", the engine's driving force will not abandon decision -making bodies before reaching the final goal. How is it possible to imagine that we are capable of creating the most competitive economic space in the world if we do not dare to free competition in this area? The already determined opening of competition information technologies, as well as improving the competitiveness of the energy sector will create new necessary jobs and will reduce prices, both for industry and consumers. Similarly, the abolition of obstacles for small and medium -sized industrial units - holds a central position in the process of improving competitiveness and prosperity - whether it is complex administrative procedures, risk capital acquisition or tax issues -. In the field of improving global competitiveness, there is also a moderate tax harmonization, as well as the modernization of our social system, so that at least the countries of Aegai with high rates of taxation can reduce the burden of taxation that restricts employment. However, the foundations are created with education and research. It is very right to seek rapid creation of infrastructure in the field of information, where both individuals, schools and businesses can have reasonable cost or free."	el
However, we cannot be enough in it, because even after reaching this goal there will still be many areas where polluting loads will exceed at such a rate that they become dangerous to both humans and environment. For this reason, I suggested in my report, in addition to the intermediate goals, long -term as well as final goals by 2020. So we could finally achieve a situation where there will be no over -level levels and loads, and where all people will be effectively protected by all the known. In this context I would like to draw attention to my amendment on the subject, because because of a linguistic error there is a wrong word in your documents. In place of the verb touches it must be put in place the verb exceeds. I hope this correction will be taken into account before tomorrow's vote. So how will we achieve a situation where atmospheric pollutants will not exceed the limits of the endurance of people and the environment? The committee, in its proposal to each Member State, has set marginal values ​​of specific emissions related to each other, causing acutes, increasing ozone to the lower layers of the atmosphere and soil eutrophicism. The joint examination of these problems and the broadcasts that create them has proven to be the most economical way to discover the factors responsible for atmospheric pollutants and to control them. The largest disagreements over the implementation of the Directive relate to the level of marginal values, that is, the limit of the emissions set by each state. The Economic Commission for Europe, which is under the auspices of the United Nations, has also examined some objectives to reduce the same polluting sources as those presented in the Directive proposal, which we are now considering. The result of these discussions was the signing of the so -called Gothenburg protocol. The distinction between this proposal and the committee's proposal is clear. If we are at the level of the Gothenburg protocol we will never achieve the goals that the Union itself set for itself about atmospheric pollutants. If we compare the differences between the Gothenburg protocol and the committee's proposal in terms of impact on health, the level of reduction proposed by the Commission will save up to four thousand people in Europe annually. Although it has been undoubtedly demonstrated that ambitious environmental goals are part of citizens' health and safety, a lower level of target has been supported on the grounds that the cleaner air costs too much in industry and society. It should be said, however, that there is a great deal of exaggeration in these costs. If we again calculate the advantages, which implies the best quality of air for humans, the environment and buildings, we conclude that the economic benefits are four times higher than the costs. Also, the proposal of a directive should be provided that both the state of the candidate and the issues concerning areas near the European Union are better taken into account.	el
And this, because this agenda is limited to only three subjects which concern in a fragmentary manner only two of the institutional bodies of the European Union.I will not repeat them, moreover, since they are known to everyone.This finding is justified on the one hand because of the permanent demand which is made, sometimes very intensely by European citizens, and on the other hand because of the enormous dimensions of this large company in which the European Union has already launched, that of enlargement.With this data, the new intergovernmental conference cannot fail to include subjects on its agenda whose treatment would guarantee the regular functioning of all and not of a few European Union institutions.As also he should understand subjects that affect daily life, and therefore obvious in the eyes of the European citizen.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the European Parliament, during numerous discussions and having regard to the many reports established so far, has openly formed in favor of the summons of the intergovernmental conference.At the same time, I ask, however, that subjects that improve and complete the reform, and I repeat, of all institutional bodies be included.But it would also be necessary to add subjects which directly concern European citizens.As for example, health, energy, culture, transport, even tourism.On the one hand, the question of whether the extension of the agenda will be achieved is still under discussion.And at this stage, I would really like to emphasize the political conduct of the Portuguese presidency, which, repeatedly, has committed itself before the European Parliament to deploy all its efforts in this direction.On the other hand, the question of the increase in the number of discussion matters in no way decreases the importance given by each member country to the intergovernmental conference because the institutional framework on the basis of which will evolve Europe in the future is the fundamental principle of European integration and therefore is of supreme national importance for each member country of the Union.Mr. President, dear colleagues, I ask the Assembly, having read this data, to approve the opinion that Mr. Leinen and I presented before you, so that the work of the intergovernmental conference begins on February 14 and that our two representatives to it, Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatsos, can, in accordance with the opinion of the European Parliament, undertake the difficult work that awaits them.The same goes for the European Commission, and I would once like to thank the Commissioner Barnier for his contacts with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he presented to us.Mr. President, the group of the European People's Party is not satisfied with the outcome of the Helsinki European Council.The agenda seemed relatively insufficient to us, because we were based on the logic of the treaty and, more specifically, on the protocol relating to the institutions of the Union.In Helsinki, governments have agreed to say that as long as the Union is made up of less than 21 states, minimis reform would suffice, but that with more members, it would be necessary reform.	fr
Ladies and gentlemen, this decade maybe, I would even say must be, that of Europe.Madam President, the Chairman of the Commission, dear colleagues, the group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome what the Commission has filed a document to prepare it.We also salute the conclusions we find in this document.In addition, we salute, in broad outline, the speech that the president of the commission, Mr. Prodi, has just pronounced.The conclusions of the document indicate that the five -year mandate of the Prodi Commission will be a major change period.Europe will progress in its integration and the Union will, at the same time, engage a phase of enlargement which will ultimately lead to the reunification of our continent.It is ambitious, we could even say prophetic.Mr. Chairman of the Commission, we wish you that this can succeed in this way.But we also say that the present is the foundation of the future and that we can only shape the future if we are proving in the present.I say it seriously and I say it with concern!I thus discuss the current discussion on the conflicts which divide the European Union at the moment.We, the European Union, are a community!We belong to the same set, even when there are problems.It is not the time not to isolate but to bring together and to carry out, together, this work of unification of Europe!Mr. Chairman of the Commission, in recent weeks, you have represented and defended the European Parliament on several occasions.You have considered yourself the Guardian of Treaties - which is your role.We expressly show you our respect, recognition and support for this, including for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria that you mentioned.(Applause) Mr. Chairman of the Commission, we agree with you on the objectives: in the 21st century, we want a strong Europe, which has the capacity to act and which is democratic.A Europe that defends its values ​​of human dignity, democracy and the rule of law, both inside and outside, and which at the same time ensures its interests in the world with dignity, patience and convincing confidence.The message of Europe, of the European Union, in the world cannot be arrogance or even European nationalism, no;Rather, it is to fall under cooperation, partnership and peaceful development.Globalization therefore represents, for us, the possibility of organizing this world which is getting closer more under the sign of peaceful competition and solidarity.Seen from this angle, globalization presents more chances than dangers, more comparisons than separations, more mutual enrichment than limitation.But we also know that we cannot meet these major challenges of globalization that together as Europeans.Globalization is not only an economic process but also a cultural process.We therefore say that we want a partnership in the world, we do not want - as some predict some - of a confrontation of cultures, of a clash of civilization;Rather, we want partnership, meeting, exchange and peace.	fr
"This strategy should be dynamic and penetrate all levels of everyday life. It is not possible to leave at the mercy of rhetorical commitments such blatant deficiencies in need of remedy. Finnish writer Samuli Paronen has written somewhere: ""For the big crimes, many perpetrators, millions - all those who remain inactive.""Mr President, dear colleagues, I think the reports we heard this morning are eloquent. Racism and anti -Semitism have spread to the European Union and beyond it. The first thing to do is not to show tolerance but to publicly denounce the situation. Mrs Ludford's report, thanks to her clarity, actively contributes to this fight. The complaint of racism, including racist declarations, is not an act of censorship against freedom of opinion, as some would like to present it, because racism is not a view but a crime, as it is an attempt against human dignity. Racism is an antisocial behavior that reaches the point of threatening the physical integrity of individuals. We recently saw this in El Ejido, Spain, or a few years ago in attacks on Rostock Turkish houses, or with the death of young Ibrahim Ali, who was assassinated in 1995 in Marseille by the National Front posters. In any case, some people were ideologically equipped to get into action. And then, there is another racism, which is made up of harassment and daily humiliations. We observe it through discrimination on access to housing, recreational activities, employment. You all know this example - recently mentioned by the French press - that of the young man from Strasbourg who sent two identical resumes to the same company. In one of the two there was a surname that indicated foreign descent while in the other there was a common French surname. I let you guess which of the two ""candidates"" was asked to go to the interview. Similarly, we cannot today be content with the defense of what we have classified as minorities; we must escape this other ghetto. There is no minority that we are called upon to protect, but we need to create a European citizenship that will be founded in some common values, a majority that will expect a common destiny, a majority in order to build a society where everyone can grow, a majority. In its historical journey, Europe has shown that it was capable of the best and the worst. The best, is the Ecumenical Declaration of Human Rights, it is the Geneva Convention, but the worst is colonialism, shoah, Stalinism, Nazism. We have to teach all this to our children. We must definitely choose what strengthens Europe and reject what weakens it and with this opportunity to send a clear message about the kind of society we want to build. And I say no rotation that those who believe we can tolerate an alliance with extremists to win the election, they will be overturned and permanently sent to the timeline of History, because the alliance with Haider or Le Pen people are like you have to do it:big enough. I also want to remind those who embrace an ethnic concept of the nation the Clilenceau saying: ""Patriotism is love for your country, nationalism is hatred for others."""	el
In particular, we need to pay attention to the creation and maintenance of resources in the areas of separation that promise a lot for the future. These resources exist of course in information technology, e -commerce, tourism and, among other things, in the field of old age services, since our population is undoubtedly aging. In two things we have to emphasize both we and the committee and the Council, and we should always remind you. These tasks will always be practiced primarily by the Member States - whether they are education and research, increasing competition or removing obstacles for entrepreneurship. Coordination is normal in many areas even in the context of the duties of the Aegean in order to avoid overlapping, but healthy and honest competition is even more important in many trade in trade. The use of methods, on the one hand, on the basis of the benchmarking and on the other hand of the best practice, which is constituted by the Commission, requires a large transparency at European level in areas that do not fall within the professional secrets of businesses. The team of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats emphasizes its pursuit of developing a social, or as it is called today, a market economy of the market, which will take into account the well -being of the whole of society, as well as the protection of the environment. When realizing our goal we emphasize the importance of the European social model, but at the same time we stress that this cannot be a rigid, static system based on the advantages acquired in society, but should evolve as society changes. The modernization of the European social model and increasing its effectiveness is just as important for our competitiveness as the corresponding modernization of the economy. Work must be the most appropriate way to achieve well -being of families, but if this is not possible, there should be the relevant security net of society to prevent social exclusion. There is a risk of a change in ways of working to be a social disadvantage for the positive evolution of human relationships: IT, the internet, the terminals we are working on, and the television that is now considered obsolete threaten to give the relationship between man and the capital. However, the most important are the relationships that mature among people, in the family, in the workplace, in society and in international contacts. Since we emphasize the importance of education, we must already seek to realize our youth early on the importance of human relations. The Commission is correctly referred to in my opinion in deficits, which prevent the increase in employment in the European Union. One of them refers to the know -how deficit. At the age of fifteen million unemployed, there is already a lack of about one million workers in areas where there is a lack of know -how. Some propose to introduce high -training workforce into the European Union. I ask, is this fair to those less developed by us countries, which we will thus be deprived of their spiritual potential? The United Nations again points out that after two years there will be a shortage of forty millions of workers in Europe due to demographic evolution.	el
"To speak frankly, a hierarchy of oppression was created.And as long as citizens are not equal before the law, this inequality leads to discrimination and erosion of human rights.In our process of expanding within the EU, we have focused, with reason, on human rights and the protection of minorities.We must not derogate from this commitment.But we must also look at us in the mirror and recognize our own imperfections.Yes, conventions have been signed, but we must act.I would recommend that you carry out continuous audits concerning human rights practices, constant vigilance, not only outside our borders but also inside.This is why I would appreciate an annual report on the part of all Member States having to report any complaint concerning him and the action undertaken, because what is happening in a Member State touches us all.What is happening in another part of the world affects us.The case of Pinochet in Chile is as important as that of Haider in Austria.Human rights and civil freedoms are inextricably linked.Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are linked to our development policies, to our economic policies, to our internal affairs policies;They are in fact at the height of our democratic functions.I will repeat what Mr. Patten said: We must commit, we must inform, educate and therefore make real and lasting changes.Mr. President, ""Europe represents ideals, values ​​and principles. We must honor the intellectual history of Europe. We must rehabilitate the values ​​that unite it. Intellectual life is part of Europe to spread throughout the world. We must live with our conscience.""Thus was expressed three hours ago, in this hemicycle, the Czech President Mr. Vaclav Havel.In a particularly edifying discourse, marked by the knowledge of men, wisdom, historical knowledge and understanding of the intellectual and Christian heritage of Europe, he indicated the sources of inspiration to which our work in favor of human dignity and human rights should draw.We must be grateful that our Europe has heads of state of the caliber of Mr. Vaclav Havel.I would like to mention two subjects.It is first of all that of civil society.Mr. Vaclav Havel said earlier that the communist regimes of Eastern Europe methodically destroyed civil society: popular movements, churches and independent unions.This is what happens in China, with the Falun Gong movement and the Catholic and Protestant churches.This is also what happens to Tibetan Lamaism.We must never forget to defend civil society.I would also like to mention the question of the death penalty.The EU, just like my own country, Sweden, has the basis of a vision of the world centered on equality between men and on the unique and inviolable value of human existence.Starting from this principle, one must always leave the man a chance to return to his actions.It must be said to the government of the United States, the Russian government and the Chinese government.Mr. President, Mr. President in office, Mr. Commissioner, in my opinion, the approach of the EU member states in Geneva should aim to place the situations of Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China."	fr
And they are right, because this detailed and compulsory map that will provide uniform definitions for citizens for the whole of Europe will impose a kind of strict legal protective umbrella that will trap every people in rules that will not be completely their own. Our claim that this map will limit citizens' rights is based on three reasons. First, under the guise of the greatest protection of citizens, they will remove them from the place where their justice is determined by weakening the sovereignty they have today. The result will no longer be able to modify the rights of their citizens without the consent of the remaining fourteen, an oppressive system that will contradict the nature and interests of Europe, as I explained in the minority view attached to the report. The map will then provide a new pretext for an excessive single citizens' rights in Europe. I am also surprised that governments are allowed to be seduced. Didn't they learn from the sorts of the past? They want - I am referring here e.g. In the French government - to load twenty problems like that of hunters tomorrow at the same time? Finally, this map will seek to bypass the rights of the communities, and first of all the national community, which is valuable to citizens, since this environment is expressed by the most true and legitimate democracy. Here we are at the heart of what we have described as a process of restricting rights, which can also go far beyond what we believe, as a whole series of persistent demands and minorities that testify to how it is clearly understood that if the map is uniform,It is the weak point of the democratic chain. That is why the Group for Europe of Nations believes that the map, if eventually prepared, should be very brief and present only the core values ​​and fundamental principles of European countries in the form of a political declaration. We can also assume that by the end of this year, the candidate countries will join it to demonstrate that they share European values. Based on this case, the Declaration of the map from today's and future members should be common. It is certain, Mrs. President, that we must definitely avoid imposing on the countries of Europe, on the pretext of building a post-national society that Mr Duff, a single and binding text, which can be perceived as a violation of the freedom of choice. Each country must continue to be able to freely choose its rules in accordance with its culture and its development. We would like the intergovernmental conference that begins its work to keep in mind this important rule of respect for national democracies. Madam President, on behalf of the League of the North, which I represent here, I find with true satisfaction that we are finally training a European map of fundamental rights.	el
The situation is serious in the sense that today, even in the European Union, there is a clear relationship between unemployment and poverty. This is evident from the fact that unemployment has risen to an average of 23.7 % in this problem in areas that are the same as poor areas, while in the 25 areas with the lowest unemployment and the rich areas, the unemployment rate is only 4 %. Due to this situation, the report which Parliament accepts must clearly express the need to take unambiguous action to overcome relative poverty and unemployment. Actions that are such as frequently used structural funds for these purposes, together with centralized state policies, or such as modernization of communication and telecommunications, especially by attaching the least developed areas to the European railway network for 2007, or developing and developing their country's agricultural and fishing capacityNon -insensitive policies, as well as promoting active policies to create jobs, preferably for women and young people. Only the decision-making implementation of such actions can overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical consequence of inevitable disadvantages, but the historical consequence of exclusion and negative economic policies. The Mr President, the Member of the Commission, the colleague Berendi's report is closely followed by a strategy decided by the European Commission, which is definitely a priority to improve competitiveness. Other objectives of the Structural Funds, such as improving employment, improving the implementation of equality, and increasing the sustainability of employment and development are only mentioned. This position seems to me to be unfair to me, and I would also ask that these things are much more into account in the seventh seasonal report. This does not mean that I do not understand the necessity of competitive strengths, all the more, because I myself am an entrepreneur myself in the area of ​​target 1, namely the German Federal Republic of Brandenburg, and I know very very small and medium -sized enterprises. In the areas of Objective 1, it is absolutely necessary to take time -time measures, namely employment activities, special programs supporting women's employment and supporting business. They are supported through the appropriate functions of the European Union Structural Funds. Supporting the competitiveness of companies alone can never replace the sought -after cohesion of economic and social development, as these areas 1 of this target simply lack the basics of self -employed economic growth. And the experience that economic development alone does not contribute to the reduction of unemployment, of course, the fact that the creation of new jobs at all requires growth of GDP at least 3 %. Focusing on demand and supply-oriented economic policy alone cannot work as such. And if it is already practiced, most of the expansion investments and less rationalization investments must be implemented. They must definitely be linked to economic policy that focuses on demand so that we have the opportunity to improve the social situation of these areas at all. These situations are very, very different in different areas. This also means that numerous support measures are also needed to do something in these areas at all. These support measures would include, for example, vocational and postgraduate activities, measures to re-integrate people from the production process to work and the flexible formation of working time and working time models to strictly better combine personal and social aspects and support women's employment again. Mr President, thanks to the rapporteur for his in -depth report. The main goal of the Structural Funds is to improve social and economic cohesion between the European Union regions. By encouraging a variety of investments in nature, the European Union seeks to increase the GDP per capita and improve employment. Based on the sixth seasonal report on the areas, it can be carefully concluded that these incentives do not always have the desired effect. Actions aimed at raising a breath towards the calculated GDP in the target 1 areas do not always lead to a rise. This is certainly not a satisfactory result during the period as the economy has been rising especially in recent years.	fi
"The Union fulfills its role as it strives to encourage peoples, together with its cooperative policy, to adopt the foundation of common values ​​whose cornerstones are democracy and the freedom of citizens. It fulfills its mission well if it involves the nations in their choices or, in its absence, comes up with a new ""meaning of history"" in which the self -determination of peoples is not only one -way. The construction of a community is only relevant if it creates only positive discrimination: the Uen Group hopes that this signal designated for the former Republic of Yugoslavia Macedonia and its concrete consequences can promote the development of this part of this part of this part of the European Part of the Public States. Frasson report (A5-0021/2000).(DA) The Danish Social Democrats of the European Parliament have today supported the report of Monica Frasson, a member of Parliament, which will adopt the Agreement with the Commission with the Commission of 28 June 1999 on the detailed rules on the application of the new Council (""Commitology""). In all matters, we emphasize that EU cooperation decision -making processes must be as open as possible, including to ensure the necessary democratic control. With this Agreement, the European Parliament will automatically take over the relevant material issues that have been approved in accordance with the provisions of Article 251 of the Treaty. We would like to expand this arrangement so that it would also apply to the issues where the European Parliamentary Committee will only receive the material for itself when requesting it. Approval of this Agreement does not mean that we have achieved our ultimate goal of transparency and democratic control through a commitology procedure. However, it is a real progress in the right direction that we do not want to prevent.(The session was suspended at 1:23 pm and continued at 3:00 pm) Restructuring of European companies on the agenda is the next Commission's statement of the Structural Reform of European companies..(EN) Mr President, the development of new technology, global competition and consumer behavior guide industry change, which can take place gradually or suddenly. It has financial consequences and affects employment and social cohesion, but it also offers important new opportunities if it is anticipated and if it occurs in a preparatory and controlled manner. The acceleration of technological development and the increasing competitive pressure on the internationalizing markets will quickly adapt their operations and business structure. Companies must be able to anticipate and find out at an early stage of what they need to do in order to continue their operations. In some cases, it requires combining operations. The Commission is closely aware of the situation and the need for basic safety of people in difficult changes. We are convinced that a dialogue at different levels, based on complete and open information, is the key to successful adaptation to change. Recently, we have gained a variety of experience and indications of how the business reorganization, which often applies to the lives of many Europeans, should be taken care of. In some cases, these reforms have been prepared well in advance, employee representatives have been fully involved and have been carefully sought to find the least damage -causing solutions. If necessary, retraining has been organized for workers who are likely to suffer from the reform to survive sudden unemployment. In some cases, the reforms have been launched and passed through much of the workers suffering from them. The Commission has in all contexts and last October in Parliament emphasized the following basic premises. Firstly, decisions on the restructuring of a company are privileged and are also responsible for corporate management. This means that when companies are considering actions that are likely to have serious social consequences, such as job loss, they should always actively seek and choose the most positive and least harmful solution. Secondly, when the dismissal of employees proves to be inevitable, the employability of these persons must be improved in every way possible."	fi
"This seems to be a permanent phenomenon in the area. We have condemned Russia's actions in recent months in five different resolutions. At times, they have had one -sidedness that has not improved their effectiveness. For example, the ideas of using the Tacis program only lead to the fact that ordinary people suffer, such has not turned the Russian government line. The expansion of war and at least terrorism is a common threat. That is why we need the Caucasus Peace Conference, as these problems do not remain within the borders of Tsetsenia. Secondly, the human rights situation is intolerable and therefore requires a real explanation of human rights violations made by all parties. In addition, rapid and unobstructed access to relief organizations must be guaranteed in the area. Third, the war must be decided and the negotiations must be taken. And fourth, Russia's active participation in work against international terrorism and illegal arms trade is essential. Finally, with regard to refugees, they are being helped close to their place of residence and helping to return to their homes. However, we also need to be reminded - that we would not be too hypocritical - that when the zetsen has been turned to us to receive refugees, we have not taken refugees from that area to our own lands, as we did in a large extent from Kosovo. Here we notice the short -sightedness of our own policy. Mr President, good colleagues, we know that Russia's authority has suffered internationally great damage with the war of the Chechen. Complete and investigating human rights violations in international monitoring also corresponds to Russia's political interests. The Russian government just doesn't seem to be very convinced. Otherwise, it cannot be understood that it did not give UN ambassador Mary Robinson permission to go to Grozny or ""filter camps"". Convention now reached by the Council of Europe Human Rights Ambassador Gil-Robles with Kalamanov, a Russian-oriented Ombudsman for the Russian Tsetsenian human being, is the right step in the right direction. However, it remains credible only if the two ambassadors of the Council of Europe can also really do independent work and move freely and independently in Russia. We reject the self -interpretation of every Russian government agreement and do not accept one. If the Russian government did not follow this agreement, the Member States of the European Union must take the matter to the European Court of Human Rights in the form of an action against states against Russia and ensure that human rights violations will be investigated internationally and I can only support my member Paasilinna. We are also required to stop restoring future refugees, as the German government has done. We are also now required to admit the political asylum in our corn. It would be very sensible for all Member States to approve the German government proposals in this respect. The Mr President, even though I do not accept the politics of the Tsetsenian national leaders, I want to express the shameful acts of the Russian army in Tsetsenia, here for my comrades and myself. This is a mutable war that is primarily victimized by the Tsetsenian people, but also young Russian soldiers. We are equally indignant about the attitude of the Western and especially the European powers. A recent visit to the British Government's principal to Moscow and Putin, who is responsible for the massacre in his mildew, is a sign of the attitude of all Western powers. They have publicly made statements that judge certain aspects of the war of the Tsetsenian;In reality, they support the Kremlin politically and economically. The part of the Western loans that Jeltsin's clan has not been overwhelmed can thus be used to continue the war anti -Tsetsenia. Much of the parties represented here in Parliament participate in governments that pursue this and supportive policy. The voting in Parliament can only be used to obscure hypocrisy in the vine magazine of the Great Powers of the Great Powers in Tsetsenia. Freedom of the press in Serbia: The Yugoslav Federal Population still lives in shocking conditions, distressed by the murder and suicide policy of their government, distressing by NATO bombing and an international ban on export."	fi
Mr President, Member of the Commission, the reform of the Directive on commercial vehicle annual inspections is urgent and important. The rapporteur has, after all, ended up with a good position. Commercial vehicles drive very high kilometers each year and their condition cannot be effectively monitored by annual surveys alone. Without prior warning, roadside checks are also necessary because of the frequent driving in the Union in third countries with poor -working vehicles, which poses a serious safety risk. The reform of the Directive will significantly increase road safety if the regulations are properly followed and penalties can be set up effective, right and warning. The effectiveness of the Directive will improve if Member States are able to negotiate the harmonization of the penalty system. However, this must not slow down the rapid implementation of the Directive. The reason for the rapid reform of the Directive is a recent example of Finland. Police and the inspection authorities have recently checked sixty -two heavy vehicles in Eastern Finland. Of these, thirty -three were fined and sixteen remarks. The journey was completely suspended from three vehicles. Only thirteen vehicles were in fully acceptable condition. A significant proportion of poor vehicles were from third countries. The worst case was the Polish truck, the traction of which was completely lacking brakes, the load binding was deficient and the trailer brakes were badly badly. Everyone can imagine what a safety risk such a truck is on snowy and icy roads. Our group supports three reviews and hopes for a rapid implementation of the directive reform. Mr President and the Member of the Commission, a lot of beautiful words about this directive, and thanks to Piecyk, but since something has happened, I still want to make a small addition. I recently presented, after this Directive had been discussed by the Commission, questions that are a member of the Commission that drivers from outside the EU are driving in the EU and taking advantage of the way people, that is, especially drivers, are monitored during the technical inspections of cars. In principle, the following happens. Drivers who do not have a work permit in a Member State of the European Union and who have no employment in an outside EU country take advantage of the situation that they drive a car that is registered in one country and thus pass through all the inspections outside the country where the cars are registered. Work permits and possible employment relationships are not yet monitored in those countries. In other words, I would like to demand that this issue be not directly taken to the Directive, but that in any case, the department of the Directive would be exploited to resolve this problem to look at this point. Mr President, Mr Vice -President, Dear Members of the Parliament, the safety of our roads is important to all of us. Due to the increasing number of cars in European roads, I find it important to emphasize as much road safety but also the consideration of environmental aspects. It is also necessary, and I would like to say that Member States will take this directive into their own legislation and attach appropriate penalties to it, so that it would not remain a word of word. In practice, the best directive will be ineffective if it does not impose penalties for non -compliance or violation. Thus, I support checks that require the punishment of the culprits, as the risky, potentially endangering vehicle activity must be used to take appropriate action and accuracy required. In any case, light traffic behavior must be prevented precisely because it is a Directive, which sets regulations for heavy commercial vehicles that carry not only goods but also people. We are all deeply shocked when there are major accidents that are purely technical deficiencies. After thinking about this, I am delighted that the report in itself is inconsistent and that Parliament has once again proven to be a powerful force when discussing the safety of European roads and traffic. I will give my special thanks to all those who are in the committee, the Commission and the Council in this area.	fi
President, ladies and gentlemen, colleagues!I also thank the rapporteur for this excellent report.I also agree with his conclusions, in which he particularly suggests increasing the number of speakers of the judges at the Court of Justice of the first instance and giving the Court of Justice of his own translation service.I actually think this is necessary because we heard when visiting the legal committee in Luxembourg, that of course inevitably, inevitably, so to speak, when using the joint translation service, the Court of Justice has preceded the Court of Court before the court of the first instance and therefore often important things in the court of first instance cannot be adequately treated.But I also believe that the reforms have to go further than what we will now decide here.I think, for example, it is worth considering, for example, in the areas where saying bodies that are already like a court like that decide in advance - I only call the keyword Alicante or as is also planned for European civil service law - to make the first instance court and to establish a final responsibility here.I also see that we probably have to do something in connection with the tendencies at the European Commission to renationalize competition decisions again and to relocate to the national level.Here it seems to me to think about thinking about it, because these cases no longer land first instance at the court, but rather as reference would be made at the Court.We should consider how we will finish this situation.Maybe there should also be the possibility of making lectures in competitive matters to the specialized Chamber of the Court of the first instance.In addition, one also has to consider whether it is correct - and we had cases in which MPs or factions against the European Parliament have sued - that the first instance is responsible for such questions, although constitutional issues are actually touched and that these things logically actually belong to the Court of Justice and less before the first instance court.One last point: I also believe that Olaf needs control under the rule of law.At the moment Olaf is in a vacant space and can do what it wants.I think it is necessary for a court to control Olaf.The only court that can do this reasonably would be the first instance court.That would also be a suggestion for the further reform process.Mr President, I would like to join those who congratulated the rapporteur on his work.The European Union is a system that relies on the right.It must therefore have dishes that can implement this right.In addition, if the courts can not treat the legal matters with which they are dealt with appropriately and quickly, what Ms. de Palacio Vallelersundi has already mentioned, namely that a delayed case law is known to become a refused case law.The report on the Court proves that this is currently happening, and it shows which steps to contain the problem can now be undertaken.But, as Mr. Marinho said, more has to be done, but that has to wait until the government conference.	de
If we had had such arrangements, I repeat, the disaster would probably not have occurred.This is why we think that we must review the applicable texts and, in particular, the 1992 protocol which exempt the charters, in this case the charter oil, from all responsibility.However, if the charterer is exempt, it is of course less involved in the controls of oil companies.You must therefore review the regulations and thank you, Madam Commissioner, for pointing all the current inadequacies of European provisions.In addition, we must above all, you have said, strengthen controls: those of the state of the pavilion, those of classification companies.You told us that Rina was an Italian classification register recognized by the Commission.Under what conditions is this recognition?What are the reliability guarantees?You will send a mission.We expect the results with great interest.It is also necessary to strengthen the controls of the maritime authorities, control in European ports.It exists, it must be remembered, a memorandum of Paris, which involves a minimum of control, a quarter of the boats released in European ports to be controlled by the maritime authorities of the country concerned.This obligation is not respected, neither in France, nor in many other European countries.For what ?What are the consequences that has already been drawn or is about to draw the commission?It also seems to me necessary to strengthen control over the charter, in this case the oil tanker.If its financial responsibility is engaged, no doubt this control will be more exercised.Finally, coordination of maritime authorities is necessary to achieve a sort of European system similar to the coast guards who monitor the coasts of the United States.I would first like to thank my colleagues in charge of the environment within my group for having addressed this particular problem in a joint manner with their team responsible for transport.This disaster affects both transport and the environment and is not confined to an area.We are again in the Parliament to debate yet another maritime disaster.I could detail the list of disasters that struck this sector during my ten years of presence within the Parliament but I only have three minutes.There is no doubt that it is high time that the Member States but also this paper tiger known as the International Maritime Organization and, last but not Least, the oil companies as well as the owners of oilmen assume their responsibility by acting to put an end to these ecological and human tragedies which repeat themselves over the years.How many Erikas must we bear to make the authorities formed provide us with an appropriate control system carried out by the state of the port which is effective everywhere within the European Union and not only in certain regions?How much pollution should we still undergo before the industry builds oil tankers with separate tanks and double hulls?	fr
I believe that if these review proposals are accepted, the parliamentary credibility of environmental issues is indeed put to the test. So far, Parliament has been a positive promoter of environmental protection, but if a member of Florenz and Member Langen is approved, we will negatively affect the European environment in this matter. In addition, if we weaken the responsibility of the producers in this matter, it would also have serious consequences at the time we start dealing with matters in this field, such as a future electronics and computer directive. Therefore, I would urge Members of the Parliament to oppose all of the group boundaries on the common position that would weaken the level of our environmental activities and reduce the responsibility of the producers. Thus, we can reach an environmentally acceptable solution. Mr President, this excellent directive stops taking old cars to landfills, promotes recycling and, above all, encourages manufacturers to design cars that are easy to recycle. Who should then pay the cost? What the system will then be introduced, the costs will ultimately be transferred to the consumer. We can best achieve our environmental goals if we allow manufacturers to both raise money and dispose and recycle cars. Manufacturers have struck the rapporteur Florenz and member Langen to have a significant impairment of these suggestions. Don't let the car manufacturers peak yourself! If you want full benefit from this directive, reject these checks in the vote. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good colleagues, this discussion, unlike we might think, is not technical in nature. It has become quite a political debate. Yesterday we had a political debate in honor of our institution. If today 314 members surrender in front of the lobbyists of certain vehicle manufacturers, it is a shame for us. If consumers are asked to pay half of the costs of the back of the scrap vehicles, as stated in the revision 38, while the common position demanded that the cost of the cost from manufacturers, for the first time, would not ensure the interests of consumers and European citizens, but would in some sense the lobbyist's sympathy. We cannot accept that. Such a precedent would leave the road open for all kinds of pressure in many other areas. This would also be the first time that the European Parliament would weaken the Council's position, when I usually specifically strengthen it. For example, the free collection system for old vehicles and the increase in recyclable vehicles would improve recycling activities in the same proportion and create more jobs. As a result, due to the benefit of the consumer and the environment and the new jobs resulting in recycling, we are by no means allowed to change the common position of the Council, which in its current form is quite acceptable. Mr President, like so many others here today, I think this is a good measure. This is a useful procedure that we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. Some details still need to be completed, but most of the technical issues have been resolved. We have reached the last question. Only the Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs asked this issue in the first consideration, and only I as a preparation for that committee, I asked that question in Parliament. The question is simply: who pays? In the joint position of the Council, a reasonable compromise was made in that the manufacturers have to pay a significant part of the costs, not all costs, as the member Bowis said erroneously. In fact, according to lawyers, perhaps as little as 20 % or one fifth of the cost. It's not unreasonable. For example, if you think about a UK consumer who buys a Rover, as a member Lange implied, or any other car brand in the United Kingdom, and for years have had to pay over prices for these cars, clearly more than the corresponding prices are elsewhere in Europe, why should he pay? He has already paid. Why should these same people, as taxpayers or future car buyers, pay again for the destruction of the vehicle for which the manufacturer has won?	fi
Because of the extremely positive and constructive reactions that were expressed in the consultation period last month, we feel extremely encouraged, and I therefore think that despite a slight delay in the design and application of the reforms, the understanding and commitment, which were conscious by us, are brought to an intensive implementation.I would be happy to see a faster implementation of the matters, but it is better to handle it as properly.Mrs. President!We admire Mr. Kinnock's mind and realism.Because while he draws the image of a well -functioning, powerful administration, he also refers to the difficulties that will arise and that are already predictable.Mr. Prodi said the commission will deport certain tasks.The political priorities must therefore have already been presented.But it is more important to explain what you want to do before you get rid of certain things.I can imagine that you would otherwise have a lot of people against yourself.The expansion is that I mean the expansion of the Union, one of the major challenges.I would also like to point out that the preservation of peace will require far more effort to activate many more people in this area.We have to move away from the rather bureaucratic approach, as is now being practiced in the entire development cooperation, and resolutely take a course for cooperation for peace.Can Mr. Kinnock indicate what he is expecting from the council and what he expects from Parliament in relation to the timing of such priorities?I thank Ms. Maes not only for her comments that have just been put up, but above all for her tireless commitment to changes that she has shown since the beginning of her MP.I would like to assure her that we have no motivation to give matters, but we focus on main tasks and focuses, not about avoiding any obligations, but to provide the absolute guarantee that we can fulfill the most important obligations that we have.These obligations are certainly - and I agree with Ms. Maes - the preparation of an effective, friction and problem -free expansion, which works for mutual benefits both of the people of the interpreting countries and the citizens of the current Union.To be able to guarantee that we can perceive this absolutely important role as a catalyst of the expansion with the greatest possible effectiveness is one of the reasons to ensure that we concentrate on our priorities with conscience and strictly.Furthermore, I would like to tell her that the mechanisms for strategic planning and program position, which are made possible by a measures -related administration and whose introduction we intend, may occur as if they were terribly dry and unnecessary every little bit of idealism.However, since I have been brought up in the faith that the victory must be organized, I may be able to ask you to understand and support our mechanistic views, since it is about the great and central concerns of the Union and its expansion.I hope that with regard to the degree of cooperation and partnership that we entertain with the Council and Parliament in all questions of this policy, not only an immediate and effective implementation of the development of political measures can take place, but also that we will be able to proceed at the right time, which means that we will achieve the greatest possible benefit for the Union.	de
We also need more strict criteria for the interpretation of the results of the controls.The most important parts of amendments 25 and 73 of the Parliament can therefore be accepted in principle.The new definition contained in amendment 72 is however too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose.I would suggest that amendment 92 be incorporated into a wider solution.Amendment 71 does not take into account seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of groundwater.The proposal cannot therefore be accepted.The Commission considers that it is not very realistic and unnecessary to establish standards which ensure that the treatment of the least intensive water purification is sufficient to produce quality drinking water from surface water.On the contrary, we prefer an annex to the measures required under article 11 to encourage actions in this area.The status required under this proposal must ensure that the requirements for good quality surface water are satisfied.This part of amendment 41 cannot therefore be accepted.The Commission appreciates the efforts of the Parliament aimed at ensuring that said combined approach is given a central role.Amendments 22 and 47 define this approach and its scope, which the Commission may approve in principle.To obtain the largest legal clarity and proportionality, we want to reformulate amendment 47 and add a minimis provision.Water transfers are already included in the controls, but an explicit mention makes the text clearer.This part of amendments 49 and 87 can therefore be approved.However, it is not necessary to set as a condition that all measures to orient the request be taken.The proposal already establishes that the capture of water must be made in accordance with an ecological use of a hydrographic basin.These parts of amendments 49 and 87 cannot therefore be accepted.The Commission approves amendment 76 which implies that radioactive substances are explicitly included in the proposal.In summary, the Commission can adopt 72 entire amendments, in part or in their principle.The following amendments cannot be accepted: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 103, 106.I pleasurely welcome the efforts made by the Parliament in order to solve the problems for which the advice of the council differs.Significant progress has been made and the constructive tone of discussions creates an excellent working climate for future negotiations.The number of obstacles remains identical, but I am convinced that at the rate in which the work of legislation continues, we will achieve our common objectives in order to develop a water policy which we can be proud of.A firm decision -making on the part of the Parliament will largely contribute to the implementation of an ambitious European water policy for the next three decades.I would like to hear the point of view of the commissioner on amendment 45.	fr
"Now, and I would like to say that in the direction of the Netherlands, the negotiations about it took place in an earlier stage.The result is an increase of 30 %, so we are not unhappy about it.It is of course always better, and I will always advocate making more money available and a little faster.But I think this program offers good chances for many programs.I would like to emphasize that culture is not only promoted from this fund.Culture not only falls into the culture department, but also in many other areas.There are also considerable financial resources available for culture in the structural funds.We also have to keep this in mind and take into account accordingly.Fortunately, I am sitting in the committee of regional policy, transport and tourism and will therefore make sure that this is also due.We have decided to agree that the budget is sufficient, because if it is not approved, this is enough for the citizens.I always supported the rapporteur in it.I still think it is necessary, and he says again and again that there is a change in the co -decision procedure at the upcoming government conference, then there must be no principle of unanimity.We are quite positive about the numerous improvements that have been made.No more mega projects, space for cultural networks, great attention to promoting reading, translation, translation services that are certainly important for the smaller language areas.I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and Ms. Reding on ""Kultur 2000"".All I have to do is say: Now we are going to work.Mrs. President, actually all the previous speakers have already taken away the words.In my opinion, there is agreement among the political parliamentary groups and the members of the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, Media and Sport, which I belong to.I too will vote for the joint draft of a decision by the Council and the European Parliament.Not because our delegation as well as our rapporteur and chairman, Mr. Gargani, had not done an excellent job - you have made a lot of effort - not because I think that I think that I thought that I thought that it is available - but because of the negative and unacceptable position of the council within the scope available to her.It's a shame!This amount, 167 million euros for such a long period of time, is a shame for the European Union!It's really sad: In the meantime, we are now forced to humiliate theater groups, young musicians, forward -looking art projects and writers to be humiliating, yes, to humiliate them by delighting and rejecting thirty.Of course, this arouses the feeling in these people that Europe is strange to the efforts of cultural creativeism, dismissive, dismissive, even straight away, for which the European Union should actually be committed - because our path is not just the euro, is not just the extension, are not just geostrategic considerations.Our task is to lead the matter of European unification to cultural flower."	de
"The communication of the Commission that we examine today and which constituted the basis of discussion from which the Council has spoken in November reflects in a balanced manner in which we can improve the discussion, to expand our knowledge of the challenges that the Member States will face in matters of social policy in the coming years, during which we will witness the aging of the populations as well as to the consequences of the enlargement.Many member states are already experiencing serious social problems today and are faced with significant social spending at the level of their public budgets.If reforms are not introduced, we risk eroding the economic basis on which social policy is based;However, a strong and competitive economy is the best guarantee of good quality social security.We are therefore delighted that these themes are on the agenda.The expression ""social convergence"" is often used during discussions relating to the coordination of social policy within the EU.As a liberal deputies, the concept of social convergence is a concept that we accept insofar as the EU is a question of establishing large common objectives that states must endeavor to achieve through their national social policy.It is therefore not a harmonization, but of common objectives.It is a fact that the EU member states organize their social policy in different ways.We have different traditions, different cultures and despite many points of resemblance, the character of social problems and their magnitude also differ from country to country.This is why it is important to underline the fact that social policy represents a national prerogative.National policy is obviously subject to a certain number of common managers, whether minimum social rights established by the treaty, the guarantee of free movement of workers without losing their social rights, the coordination of economies as well as economic cooperation.Coordination and cooperation are elements that must be added, but convergence must be based on objectives and not on means.I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Jan Andersson, for the very constructive efforts he has made with a view to trying to reconcile different points of view and thus guarantee support for his report.I will vote for his report, but there are a few points that are not entirely for my taste.I do not agree with the point which requests that the Commission intervenes against what is called unfair competition between social and tax systems if such intervention is intended to curb innovations, the evolution and improvement of the efficiency of our social systems or if it aims to prevent a reduction in the tax pressure too high in many Member States.I am skeptical about the detailed regulations which could result from the intervention of the Commission with regard to the extent and quality of child care plans and the care to be provided to the elderly and I am skeptical about the value of a common threshold of poverty."	fr
The question is of great importance, and I would like to know, since one can speak of baby fraud whether the Lord will work for it so that these funds will not be withheld from the Andalusians so that the funds that the European Union pays on Andalusia based on the registration register are taken into account these four hundred thousand children, which Aznar is not interested in giving them schools and services.Ms. MP!Please think about it - please do not understand this as a warning - that we treat strictly communal topics.I know that these are very important topics in Spain and there are different perspectives ... I tell the Lord Commissioner that Aznar is the President of the Spanish government.Would you answer the request?As I found, Mrs. MP, they have a strong voice, and I hope that it was loud enough to have been heard in Madrid.However, it is clear to me that your words did not address me directly.I answered them.It is due to me that the structural funds and especially those for goal 1 come where they are needed.There are criteria that have to be observed and we know roughly what every European region should or could.Regardless of this, I have to - and this is not an excuse, but I have to address the general structural fund regulation - speak to the national authorities of every country and with the government of every country.It is up to them to split the funds as objectively and as fairly as possible.I have to find out that first, so I told you that I can't answer today.Since I have no information, I wrote to the Minister for Economic Affairs and Finance on December 14th.I am slowly becoming impatient that I have not yet received an answer, but I will send them to them as soon as I have them in my hands.I regret that the Lord commissioner is once again drawn into a pointed and passionate discussion in this case.In Spain - I would like to remember all of this - we are in the election campaign, there are no twenty -five days until the elections.It is a consolation for the Lord Commissioner that these elections will take place in twenty -five days, which is why he probably does not be asked for inquiries of this kind.But I think it is important to say that Andalusia will receive 50 % more in the common framework and that Spain also holds a record with regard to the use of the structural funds, which means that the distribution is strictly based on the implementation provisions and is handled by the regional development plans and the various framework of the community support.Finally, I would like to make a specific request to the Lord: does he consider a change in the implementation regulations for the structural funds necessary, or does he consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?I find this debate very revealing.It is clear to me that there is a dimension that is not exclusively common in nature.Regardless of this, one has to put up with the fact that elections are constantly taking place in all countries of the Union.	de
Now we are asked to provide the legal basis for such a surveillance.It is the combination of these two documents that you should see.The requirements provide that the authorities have access to the facilities of all providers of services, i.e. on telephones, mobile phones, internet, etc., and with the current extremely careless design, the abuse is open to the door and gate.I would also like to ask: Provided that the requirements are provided that the police have access to all providers of services without exception, does this also include the internal parliamentary service?Do we accept regulations here that allow the police to access our own systems for particularly low motives?In addition, there is no threshold for serious offenses in this proposal.That opens it far for abuse.As in turn, the reverse of the burden of proof, something that is considered recognized in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential.This is not guaranteed.Neither the preamble nor the main text take into account the right to defense, a basic principle of international fundamental rights.This question is extremely serious.We are very concerned about the direction that we strike here without proper public debate in the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the inclusion of organizations for civil freedoms from all over Europe, which are extremely worried about these developments.Mr. President, I am neither a member of the committee for the freedoms and rights of citizens, justice and internal affairs nor a lawyer, but like almost all colleagues, I can understand how necessary it is that in addition to the uniform economic area in Europe there is also a corresponding uniform space of law, freedom and security.In this respect, questions of justitial cooperation in criminal matters are very important.What did I make clear to me when reading the corresponding texts?I have understood that in view of all the contradictions, the contrary opinion about what Europe is now, in view of the diversity of the judicial systems, which not only creates confusion and inefficiency, but also leads to a real dangerous situations, is risky to rely on the regulations of the council.This applies, for example, to Article 18, which many colleagues have also pointed out and, according to which every country, every large country, if they want, can monitor every country that has the technical possibilities of the telecommunications traffic of another country without the approval of the affected country.In my opinion, the right committee and the rapporteur DI Pietro submitted an extremely interesting report.Unfortunately, Mr. Di Pietro was unable to explain the well -founded reason in his five -minute and therefore really short speaking time here.In any case, it is about the protection of the rights of both the countries and the accused and the citizens.In my opinion, this approach should be deepened and braver.However, I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that in this context the criminal law is setting or even schizophrenic framework conditions.A young person, a student or student who smokes a hashish cigarette is drawn up pedagogically in one country.	de
Due to the existence of borders, they have turned into departing regions of the states to which they belong, with the result that the national authorities often neglect these regions in the context of national policy. For this reason, immediately since 1990, the Interreg Community Initiative was inaugurated. The aim of this program was to encourage cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation, as well as a balanced development of the community space to enhance economic and social cohesion within the Union. Interreg is primarily aimed at funding joint diamonds regarding the development of small and medium -sized enterprises, training and education, cultural exchanges, health problems, environmental protection and improvement, energy networks as well as transport and telecommunications networks. I insist on the fact that interregional cooperation contributes to the participation of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration. A more active involvement of local and regional authorities in Community initiatives must actually be promoted, taking into account that often local and regional authorities have very limited opportunities for cooperation due to different legal framework and different levels of growth on either side. In the context of cross -border cooperation, more emphasis should be placed on improving the conditions of exercising the activities of small and medium -sized businesses that create jobs. In the same context, and since structural unemployment represents 50% of total unemployment, the credits available for Interreg must be high enough to complete national measures to enhance employment. More specifically, obstacles that are often related to taxation (double taxation) and social security prevent, restrict or make cross -border movement particularly problematic. I hope the plans that are being made within the programs will contribute to finding solutions to these problems and make the beginning of the free movement of workers, a principle that is threatened in my region! Interreg funds should also contribute to the creation of a European research area. Finally, and more importantly, the expectations of the regions from this initiative are large and areas that are not eligible under target 2 hope to be compensated thanks to Interreg! What is at stake is therefore important: the incorporation of the border regions will be an essential element of the creation of a future European Planning Planning! May everyone, like Mr F. Decourrithre, whom I congratulate, to realize it! The Interreg Community Initiative is an element of a devastating European regional policy. This policy, generous at first glance after being officially intended to assist the regions facing problems, deceives the French taxpayers. France, which contributes 17% to the European budget, will receive only 8% of the regional structural funds. Between 1994 and 1999 our regions received 15.4 billion francs each year, while between 2000 and 2006 they will not receive more than 14.7 billion. My region, Nord-Pas-de-Calais, will be particularly affected, as French Hainaut does not receive the aid granted to the areas of target 1. This abolition is unjustified in a region whose basic activities were destroyed by Europe of free trading. European Regional Policy also reinforces the centralization of Brussels, under which regional authorities are called upon to immediately negotiate the use of structural funds.	el
He described globalization as a positive process in which I agree with it.In my opinion, globalization has contributed to the fact that numerous countries that have previously been excluded from world trade have now been integrated into the world trade system, and as far as I know, not a single country has been worse off by world trade.In other words, such as Mr. Gasòliba I Böhm, I also consider globalization to be positive and believe that it has contributed to a new international division of labor, as has been sought by many for years.Second, Mr. Gasòliba I Böhm has not yet proven that it has not yet been proven that the exchange rates are stabilized by the Tobin tax.He is right in it.I am also not aware of any reasons, which is why the collection of a tax on speculative currency transactions should lead to stabilizing the exchange rates.In my opinion, these are two important comments, and that's why I repeated them here.Allow me to determine, Mrs. President, that none of the speakers established a connection between the Tobin tax and the functioning of the European Union this evening.We all know the Roman contracts: The four basic freedoms that are anchored in them are known to include free capital.Mrs. President, I can assure her parliament that in my daily work I also try to achieve the full integration of European financial markets with my agencies and my colleagues in order to largely facilitate and flexible capital.In other words, due to my office, I am against all measures that would make international capital difficult.You can then hardly expect this commissioner to agree to a tax that would affect international financial transactions.In my opinion, the Tobin tax is in contradiction to the Roman contracts, and this is an important theoretical objection that was not brought up by any of the speakers this evening.According to these very fundamental comments, there are now practical reservations against Tobin tax, as they were expressed by Mr. Karas, but also by other speakers.It was pointed out that the European Union - unfortunately, as I have to say, could not agree internally on certain tax measures.This proves how difficult this matter is.If we couldn't get any agreement internally, how should we then convince the other trading partners?That should be a tedious process.Mr. Jonckheer said this was one of the measures that could cause stabilization of the financial markets.However, this addresses a symptom while we should pursue the causes, and in my opinion it is better to combat the causes than to treat the symptoms, which is probably not possible at all and, as I said, certainly violates the Roman contracts.To remedy these causes, the situation in the countries concerned must be visualized.Can these countries boast of what is called good governance in English?Are there low inflation and low interest rates in these countries?Do the markets of the production factors, including the labor market, work flexibly?That is not always the case.So if we are looking for the reasons for the exchange rate stability, we have to focus mainly on the elements that are part of good governance.	de
We would not like to do the same today, because the plan you offer us is so enthusiastic that it can give Europe the dynamism and the future our colleague Goebbels has requested. However, you still have to have the means, which I am afraid of lacking in part today. So it is up to you to create them. The oppressive framework of the agenda 2000 will not provide you with the necessary means. You must therefore push your colleagues to fund the proposals you will present to us. An example, among other things - and is one of the important mechanisms of what you propose - is the information society and knowledge. It is clear - and you have explained it well - that the social rift is an essential problem that we must fight. We should not add the digital rift, as I would call it. In fact, to whom will you propose this information and knowledge society? In an increasingly older or older population, in a population that remains poor and in a population, unfortunately, less and less educated. Therefore, you must act from the basis if you do not want this knowledge society to be confined to the hunting of the profit of certain new businesses with high performance. But this is not your goal. There is one absent in the mechanisms, and I am sorry for this, public services. Public services have played an essential role in the history of our European social model. Today, it is true that it is no longer the time of the monopolies and the committee began a process of liberation, exposure to the competition of certain public services to modernize and make them effective. However, we cannot stay there. We now need to define better, in the specific context of the competition and the information society, what will be in the future the primary duties of the public sector that will apply to public enterprises, as well as to private businesses in the sector. In this respect, more dynamic initiatives are needed, which are not yet contained in the Commission's work program, but which you could promote: this would in my opinion be a particularly important message. Finally, this knowledge society is based on research and development, and I would like to applaud here the initiative of the committee aimed at creating a European research area. However, in this respect, Mr President, the Commission and the Parliament will need the Council to provide the necessary means to create this European research area. The framework program will not be sufficient, we need to enhance it, change its main guidelines. It's an important project, but we rely on you. Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, dear colleagues; Mr President, you have spoken of a political deficit. I believe that the proposals you will present in Lisbon, which should make it possible to link these famous general orientations of economic policy and the guidelines for employment in order to reach the guidelines of European policy on development and employment.	el
Very large quantities of dangerous substances are transported on EU roads, railways and seas. Therefore, we must have clear rules on the implementation of transport. The area after the other is now receiving minimum rules on common Member States. It is very positive and we should thank Koch for the work he has done on this. It is also important for the potential of the internal market. If we want the common transport market to actually work, it is important that we do not only have the rules but that these rules are to a large extent common. Finally, I would like to comment on the third thing, which is also important, namely a review by Parliament Ari Vatanen. Member States differ in many ways. If we accept this check, we take into account that it may be very cold in the northern regions of the Union. Therefore, it is also necessary to pay attention to how such cold affects materials and packaging. Mr President, it is positive that we can be flexible in this regulation. I hope the Commission can accept this review. Mr President, I would like to thank not only the colleague Koch, but also the Vice -President of the Commission for being so clear and unequivocally stated that he supports and recognized the improvement in traffic safety. Colleague Koch has prepared a good report because the work of the European Committee on Standardization (CEN) and the United Nations Financial Commission has not advanced prominent. I would like to ask the Deputy Chairman of the Commission whether he can tell us today what the situation in the harmonization of both organizations is and whether the EU has the opportunity to accelerate harmonization efforts through as simple principles as possible. It is clear that even if we find a great arrangement within the European Union, traffic will not stop at the Union's borders but continue over them. Therefore, comprehensive, regionally comprehensive, regulations are certainly meaningful. If a Member of the Commission cannot do it today, is he or she will be ready to tell the committee in writing about the state of matters and the CEN and the Financial Commission? Mr President, I will once give Member Koch my congratulations on the work he has done on this second report. The report being discussed in some sense will complement the discussion that we had in October for rail transport. We all complain that the European Standardization Committee (CEN) has not been able to complete the changes to the regulations required by the European Union within the required time. With this discussion and the change of current Directive, we can include different aspects of the nature of our European diversity. Recently, Member Vatanen talked to us about low temperatures, not just -20 ºC but -40 ºC. Of course, we accept this check because it has good grounds and, in my opinion, the actual conditions that show the climatic variability of the European Union, which sometimes provides practical requirements for technical standardization or technical characteristics. It should be noted what a member Swoboda said about CEN's activities that we demanded that CEN to accelerate as much as possible, as it would be fatal if we were again in the same difficulties, despite the new deadline, not to complete the issue. Finally, the President is said that the basic problems that are behind this change of Directive have already been highlighted: We have mentioned the delay in CEN, the changes to some regulations, the conformity between the Directive and the content of the attachments, and the need to increase accuracy. The Commission is blessed with all proposals from the Committee and Rapporteur Koch, which have virtually formed four different reviews. So we accept the four reviews proposed for us. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered tomorrow at 12 noon.	fi
Mr. President, I thank colleague Langen - although he himself is not present - for the work he did to get the program through both parliament and the council.The project was long and difficult.The study to record the use of renewable energy sources must continue to receive great weight in the future.Although the new guideline contains a lot of positive things, it also has defects.An example of this is the use of peat.Peat must not be classified in the same group as fossil fuels.If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non -fossil fuels, his own class must be defined, especially in view of the environmental tax.Peat must not be measured with the same level as hard coal.The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution in order to end the depreciation of the Union's energy imports.Research also plays a particularly big role in relation to the next EU.The dependence on energy imports primarily affects Eastern European countries, whose economic structures still suffer from the dependence on Russian energy created during the Soviet period.The EU has to stick to the Kyoto climate agreement.We all worry about the environment and the future of our children.The proportion of renewable energy sources in total energy production must be increased, but in a reasonable manner.We must not forget that we can no longer build the main part of our energy generation on renewable energy sources for long.To do this, we need climate -friendly energy, nuclear energy.Mr President, for the Spe parliamentary group, I welcome it that we have come to a result in the mediation process for the Older II program.First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, the colleague Langen, for his really good work on this report.I would also like to thank the head of the delegation in the mediation committee, the colleague Provan.Because as Mr. Langen said it was really a hard fight in the mediation committee.But we can see today that the result of the mediation also clearly shows the manuscript of the European Parliament.Mr. Langen has pointed out that a number of content and demands of the parliament were taken over, and at the most important conflict point with the council, the financial resources of this multi -year program to promote renewable energy sources in the community, we have already been able to meet with which the council almost met.This is not satisfactory, I would like to say that very clearly.But we have received this compromise because it was important to us that this program can now be started really quickly.Because in the next few years the proportion of renewable energy sources in energy consumption should be doubled to at least 12 %.That is the declared goal of the European Union.The Altener program as the only EU program with the exclusive objective of the promotion of renewable energy sources is now really a key role.With this new five-year program, the actions from the Altener I program must be expanded.This includes, among other things, the deepening of the exchange of information and experience of actors in the area of ​​renewable energy sources, including the expansion of local, regional energy agencies, the development of new and the promotion of existing networks.These are just a few examples.	de
But at the end of the day one has to find the balance between those whose lives and their vital environment depend on the sea and those who chart the laws that regulate who can fish and who not and where, when and how they can fish in any particular waters in the EU. Georgia, but now, who is responsible for fishing, I would like to scold him for fishing, along with his strong colleagues, because one of the most affected areas was my region and fishermen in Northern Ireland. In fact, a moratorium was imposed without compensation, without real negotiations or discussion. They were imposed and cannot fish for a period of 11-12 weeks. At the moment we all accept that there is a problem with maintenance and that there is a problem with stocks, but what I am actually saying to you, Mr. Commissioner, and I told you in the fisheries committee, and I will say it again, is this: there is a big gap between Brussels and workers. It doesn't matter if you come from Galicia, it doesn't matter if you come from Northern Ireland or Scotland. This gap exists and we in Brussels were not able to bridge it. And we have to take into account the opinions of the fishermen. We need to take into account the fishermen's concerns and have to work closely with them and I hope that you, like the Commissioner who is responsible for fishing, will admit that there is this gap and try to work together as close as you can to ensure that all sides are close. Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Fischler. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00. Insolvency Procedures The Daily provision provides for the debate on the report (A5-0039/2000) of Mr. Lechner, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Issues and Internal Markets, regarding the Council Regulation proposal concerning the Insolvency Procedures (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999/1999/0806). Mr President, I think we are all agreeing on the creation of a European legal space. We also all agree that there is a harmonization in this area characterized by a huge divergence of our legal systems and in addition to our perceptions. The term insolvency itself, the legal concept of insolvency, does not cover the same accounting concept in all Member States of the Union. We therefore agree with this finding, and the draft regulation and the report are moving in the right direction. If you allow me, however, I would like to make some observations on the method. When we note - and we cannot do otherwise - the differences of legal systems and concepts and want to walk in the direction of a better coordination, I think there are three ways to move on. The first is to make the matches by saying: In the end, insolvency in France is the same as insolvency in England or Germany.	el
Madam President, allow me a small correction to what the Council President said. Mr President of the Council, two leaders of governments have already accepted their parliaments because of their stones against Austria. So they did not have the right to speak on behalf of the states they represent, but apparently spoke as leaders of socialist parties. So, at best, Mr. President of the Council, you can only talk about twelve states. Lady, I suggest that we do not start again the discussion of Austria, which has already been the subject of an exchange of views. I will give the floor to Mr Schulz, who wishes to make a reminder of the regulation because he was personally affected by yesterday's debate. Madam President, I rarely use this medium, but I am forced to do so because of the practices. During the debate I was attacked by Mr Gollnisch, a member of the French far -right. For this reason, I would like to state the following and please record in the minutes: I have nothing to recall from what the far -right is usurping the body for its demagogic hybrid. Mr Gollnisch, during his intervention, said, turning to me personally, that his own family would never accept fascism. This makes him different from his family in an impressive way, as he accepts fascism himself, or he is more precisely the fascist himself. Thirdly, I would like to record in the minutes that I am very much alarmed that such statements are made here. I am also alarmed because, as I have found from his vibrant applause, Caudillo Le Pen is still allowed to sit in the middle of the body, although he has already lost his electorality as a leader in the French election campaign. Mrs Schulz, we noted your statement. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00. EURODAC, Mr. Chairman of the Council, in principle, I would like to thank the presidency for its high level presence in this body and for its good mood. Last year, this body's opinion was twice received on the establishment of a system of fingerprints. Primarily, this system serves to properly apply the Dublin Convention. On April 13, 1999, this body rejected the Council's proposal to expand the Eurodac system to illegal immigrants through a protocol. Subsequently, this body's opinion on the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam was received again. We were noted that the development of this system is being sought in order to properly implement the Dublin Convention. This seems to me right, taking into account the limits that Parliament introduced in its latest report, with amendments starting with our reservations about accepting to be included in the 14 -year -old minors and reached this system, Eurodac, implemented only in the Dublin Convention. Since he informed us that he would not accept any of our proposals, I would like to ask the Council if it is prepared to have a real dialogue with parliament.	el
It is vital for the IMS to prepare the way to accept the establishment of a regime of fundamental rights under the treaty. Thus, first, citizens' access to the court will be improved, secondly, the Union itself will sign the European Convention and, thirdly, the role of national parliaments and national political parties in European Union affairs will be strongly strengthened and will be part of the responsibility for the construction of the European Parliament. My team warmly welcomes the DD and will contribute to this extent possible to this process of reform of the treaty. Mr President, the Greens Group / European Free Alliance believes that the European Parliament's decision to rush to give his opinion on the intergovernmental conference neutralizes the political importance of the request for confrontation with the Council and makes it, ultimately, is unimportant. We would prefer to have a clearer idea of ​​the agenda, some additional assurance of the method before giving our opinion and, sincerely, we did not appreciate much of the rudeness committed by the Portuguese Presidency to the European Parliament, designating its first day. I still believe that, because of the importance of this opinion, we are likely to vote for it, as the majority of our team will do. However, I would like to emphasize the fact that it is hard enough to find out how few passions this reform rises. The events in Austria prove, in a clear way, the need to have a democratic form, a democratic structure in Europe, and to determine principles on which all Member States should be supported. It is also saddened by the thought that the initiative towards Austria is in fact the fruit of an agreement between governments and that, nevertheless, the European Union and its institutions do not seem to have the means and consensus to act, to prevent and correct the course of things. I believe that this is precisely what we have to act, this is what we must do at the Intergovernmental Conference, and I hope that the European Parliament will not exhaust this opinion, which has been reluctant, the pressure action it exerts on the Council and the Member States, so that this is not the case, so that it doesParliament a while ago. De) Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr. Commissioner, my expensive colleagues, I think that one cannot say quite often and quite loudly that the Council's decision on the daily intergovernmental conference is politically completely unacceptable, and I add it. We are at a historic moment where negotiations are being carried out or rather we are in 12 countries and now we are in a situation where Europe's union can come true in a time that we can see. But how will the Union expand if they are not put in place now - that is, before enlargement - the right bases? That is why we are in favor of the intergovernmental conference.	el
"In the postal sector, the first phase is already started, suppliers of the universal service having engaged in a modernization process.Rather than the process of liberalization of the sector, it is new technologies and logistics that constitute the essential factors influencing employment.With regard to the availability of studies, point raised by Mr. Staes and other deputies, copies of each of these studies were sent to Parliament in September 1999. They are all available on the Commission's website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide a copy to any interested person.Studies have been the subject of some criticisms, particularly on the part of postal public services.I am aware that all the studies started have experienced difficulties in collecting adequate data.This did not surprise us because the operators of the universal service do not always have detailed mail collection systems.Doesn't that say long on management capacity?No unique methodology allowing access to the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all parties.However, Mr. Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken are clear and precise enough to constitute the basis of the decision -making process.I finally come to three interventions on a subject that I am supposed to know better than postal services: competition.Mr. Purvis, I found that your remark on the call for tenders, provocative on the methodological level, was interesting and was certainly worth explored.Mr. Medina Ortega, I am just as convinced as you that we will have to be even more vigilant after liberalization, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give birth, for lack of control of concentrations, to private operators.This applies both to the postal sector and other sectors.If I can give you an example of this type of vigilance, I will quote the case of the ""Deutsche Post"" for which the Commission began, following complaints and a legal action, an official procedure for examining state aid in July.We have just received the German government's response to the observations issued.The procedure for examining state aid covers the issue of cross subsidies between monopolistic mail services and commercial messaging activities as well as the financing of recent and numerous acquisitions of the ""Deutsche Post"".I will not enter into details because of the lack of time but it may illustrate, among other things, the fact that the Commission does not stop its work with the progress of liberalization.In a sense, this is where his work begins.Finally, it goes without saying, Mr. Radwan, that limits must be put in competition and these limits exist.If we consider in particular the question of competition and services of general interest, when a Member State defines a public service mission, it is important to quantify the costs generated by this mission and state aid which compensates for these costs are certainly not a violation of competition.I do not quite agree with the terms you used, Mr. Radwan, saying that it was time to take into account the needs of citizens rather than exclusively the need for competition."	fr
"Let me be able to focus on what you call here in your speech as a new way of guiding things here in my speech. You consider it a tool to make a reconciliation with citizens. However, it seems to me that this new way of guidance is simply an expression, which means the activities of the institutions and the activities of our public authorities, if we agree that the European Union must be considered a public authority. Sharing powers between Union institutions, Member States and regional and local authorities is a very good thing. But that's exactly what we really do between citizens and the construction of Europe? This is exactly what we really answer to the basic questions that are not so much ""who does what?""But rather ""what do we do together?""It is this that causes confusion among our compatriots. You mentioned the challenges waiting for us, which are globalization and expansion, and the future of our society model. It is for this reason that my group emphasizes so much about the draft fundamental rights book, as we wrote our work schedule for the preparation of this fundamental rights book precisely because we live in a historical moment, because our Union has to redefine the values ​​around which the Union is built within its current borders, but the moment is historical to future expansions. Our countrymen expect us to continue building Europe, but they do not want any kind of Europe. They do not expect us to adapt to globalization, but to be able to organize this globalization based on our social model. In this sense, I have to tell you that when you start building a political Union and we support this political Union, you must succeed in it to rely on our society model, our originality and our ability to better regulate things in this world. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Dear Commission Members, Good Colleagues, May I start my speech with the quotation: ""The Commission will continue to prepare the European Charter and make its proposal for a target program. This is the Commission's entire program for the next five years on internal security, freedoms, citizens' rights and legal cooperation. This narrow document is a farce! It is a farce because we know and appreciate the work of the Commission, and because of what is prescribed here in the form of a document, there is a blatant contradiction with the factual situation. Such a document is not the basis of the scoreboard in the first place. It was praised and celebrated as a great achievement, but I think we need the foundation of the scoreboard. As a parliament, we want to seriously discuss the future development of this political region based on the program. We look specifically the minimum standards for asylum procedure to provide refugees quickly, but so that we can also create clarity for those who are not on the way. We want tools to prevent abuse. We want the development of the Community's immigration policy, which of course also includes the integration of Member States, and we need, for example, the expansion of Europol's operational tasks so that we can take very concrete action to combat organized crime. We discuss these tasks seriously and very vigorously and are expecting it from the Commission, even though it is only about presenting documents! Mr President, the Mr President of the Commission, the Members of the Commission, good colleagues, I use the speech to deal with the world trade organization;After all, there are equal views between the Commission's documents and the position of the socialist group, which in turn does not apply in other sectors, as I have already said. The views are equal, because we are in the process of changing merchants at the world level, although we are in the process of preferring the creation of common standards, common rules that can be regulated by this world trade to achieve one goal: this trading should serve development and, above all, harmonious development."	fi
This is also characteristic of American society, which itself learns little about it.The Americans are rightly outraged by war and genocides in other parts of the world, but are wrongly silent about the genocide in their own country.Today, the Dineh Indians face the last struggle for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, their right to their own way of life.You are only a few, but your opponent is an economic power.Mr. President, revered Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!I agree with the explanations of my previous speakers, but I would like to highlight a few more things.The Dineh are among the North American Navajo Indians.They are excluded from society and have been fighting for survival for decades.They have been living under miserable conditions for years.These poor circumstances force them to bend against their will to the financial and economic pressure of the coal industry.The resettlement law issued in 1974, which includes the redistribution of the territory of the Navajo Reserve, allows the resettlement of the population groups.These resettles are of course unacceptable, since human rights are violated in economic, social and cultural terms.The Dineh Indians are pushed back and forth like chess figures and not only lose their history and the extremely important soil - the bottom of their ancestors - but they also have no view of finding work and sources of income.The resettlement law was enforced in the congress by a group that represented the coal industry.The congress has never thought about where the people who lived in the area should or how the relocation would affect their lives.The population had no say.This is almost human trafficking.The relocation was carried out and the Dineh was implemented in an uranium -contaminated area.After breaking a dam in New Mexico in 1979 and the release of 370,000 cubic meters of radioactive water and 1 100 tons of pure uranium, this place is one of the most contaminated areas in the world.The government of the United States, the coal industry and we all have to face our responsibility and ensure an acceptable alternative: either the soil is decontaminated, or the Dineh Indians are assigned a place worth living, and every necessary support is provided for psychological, social, cultural and financial level.The rights of the Indians must finally be observed.Therefore, we ask to vote for this decision: We must not be intimidated by American interests in Europe that are asserted by financial, religious and industrial groups.So we best send an urban ratio to the United States!President!In terms of human rights, there is of course a lot to be criticized in Chechnya.According to human rights organizations, Russian soldiers have killed civilians, old women and men, in Grosny, apparently even executed.Civilians are said to have been burned alive in protective cellars.We insist that these human rights violations are examined.Contrary to the promise, the violations of human rights committed in Alfanjurt, for example, were still not examined.International government organizations and non -governmental organizations must be given access to the area.The Council General Affairs of the Union decided on December 6, 1999 to send representatives of the Member States to Inguschetia in order to examine the humanitarian situation, and I am, to say the least, curious about what comes out.	de
"I seriously ask for both of these institutions to do something real, concrete and constructive in this matter. In any case, we evaluate both institutions on the basis of their actions, not their words. Mr President, Mr Members of the Commission, I would like to present my heartfelt congratulations to Malmström and the rapporteur Harder for excellent, systematic and innovative reports. In addition to the Commission and the Council, they also provide a number of proposals to Parliament on how to really improve human rights and how to guarantee them. An example is the proposal of rapporteur Malmström from a special ambassador for human rights defenders. It is the responsibility of the Parliament to systematically examine the human rights of candidates. We have good information, but we need to coordinate it and ensure that they are used so that we can influence the expansion while respecting human rights. I am also particularly pleased that the rapporteur Harder raised the rights of minority. This is a historical moment if we accept the report of the rapporteur Harder and refer to the infringements of minority rights and the lack of respect for minority rights in the EU. We are no longer allowed to give the ambiguous messages that have meant more than ourselves. I really do not hesitate to say that this is a historic moment if we accept the text of the rapporteur Harder - it would not have succeeded before. Finally, I would like to mention another thing that is important to me, namely, the support mentioned in the report of children Cecilia Malmström for the work of the Commission on Children's Rights. The Commission needs this support. We must also provide support when it comes to booking the budget for work related to children's rights. In this case, I also need to be careful about making children a merchandise. Even the rules of the Hague Convention are not sufficiently respected. There are also very, very serious problems in the candidate states. Mr President, we have an exceptionally high -quality human rights report in our hands, and I am now talking about Malmström's report, where it is also gratifying that it was in close cooperation with independent NGOs. Without civil society, we are overlooked. We cannot breathe unless we get stimulus from the outside, at the grassroots level. The report contains numerous excellent and well -thought of suggestions. Here, I pay attention to only three, where my own group has been active. The need to intervene in independent journalists, the need to protect weapons and warrior, and the need to develop intelligent sanctions, Smart Sanctions that do not have the conditions of widespread populations, but are subject to political terrifiers who have collected wealth. This is a precision weapon that should be used more. More generally, as Malmström himself, we also said that we need to develop a strategic approach to all the problems we are talking about today. It must be dynamic, it must also pass all levels of everyday reality. We cannot leave the rhetorical commitment to the screaming flaws that need to be corrected. Finnish author Samuli Paronen wrote: ""Big crimes need many factors, millions - all those who do nothing.""Mr President, good colleagues, I think the reports we have just dealt with are enlightening. Racism and anti -Semitism have increased in and outside the European Union. The first task is not to submit to, but to condemn the situation publicly. Ludford's report is actively involved in this battle. Judging racism and racist speeches is not a censorship of freedom of opinion, as some would like to believe, for racism is not an opinion but a crime because it offends dignity. Racism is an anti -social behavior that even violates the physical integrity of individuals. This was recently happened in El ejido, Spain or Rostock, where they attacked the homes of Turkish workers, or a few years ago in Marseille, where the young Ibrahim Ali was killed by the National Front Posts in 1995."	fi
"Inquiry No. 3 of (H-0027/00): Concern: Charge of NATO Before the International War Criminal Tribunal Human Rights Organizations, such as ""Human Rights Watch"" (Observatory for Human Rights) in the USA, have already collected considerable stress material against NATO in connection with the air raids in Kosovo and Serbiato submit to the Haag.On the basis of this information, some of which have already been presented to the court mentioned above, NATO is accused of serious violations of international humanitarian law and intentional killings.Is the advice of the opinion that such allegations have to be left to the judgment of the International War Criminal Tribunal in order to be subject to a detailed judicial investigation?In the event of a judicial investigation of the allegations against NATO, the council intends to proceed with the general secretary/high representative of the common foreign and security policy, who held the office of NATO general secretary during the decisive period of time?Is there a procedure to give it from his tasks until the allegations have been examined in court?President!The question of Mr Alexandros Alavanos stimulates general considerations.The Council has already stated that the application of strict measures taken by NATO was necessary and justified in order to counter extremist and irresponsible actions, which represented a clear violation of the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council.I understand that NATO's approach and the legality can be different.Everyone is free to represent such points of view.In my homeland, the individual parliamentary factions represented different opinions.Things were like that and no different.In any case, there is the clear point of view of the council in that the air strikes carried out by the organization of the North Atlantic Pact in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with the aim of ending the human disaster caused by the Belgrade regime in Kosovo.This goal was expressed formally and comprehensively by the point of view of the ""General Affairs"" Council on April 8 in Luxembourg.These measures of NATO, that must be said, were not taken lightly, but as a last remedy, when it became clear that the possibilities of a negotiating solution were exhausted and that the Belgraders' authorities concentrated their armed forces in order to drive away the Kosovo albanium from their homeland.The MP has surely learned that the recent visit to NATO when she recently visited NATO, the International Tribunal was obliged to investigate all charges, including those who were raised against NATO, especially Canadian pacifist groups.This mandatory examination takes place to the extent that these charges are raised.In any case, I have an explanation of the woman's indictment with me, in which she says that there is currently no investigation against NATO from the office of the prosecutor of the International War Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia and that there is no formal examination procedure on NATO's procedure in the Kosovo conflict.All information that has been received in the past six months from both individuals and groups to apply for an investigation of the NATO actions during the Kosovo conflict were registered by the prosecutor.The prosecutor will of course examine all other information and, in due course, inform you whether there is an opportunity to act."	de
"Tomorrow it's about a few points.First, we know that the transport of people and goods with the ship is the most environmentally friendly in relation to other transport types.At the same time, we know that the ships contribute to the pollution of the oceans through garbage, load residues and oil sludge.The fuel for ships is once heavy oil, and we know that 1 % to 3 % of this heavy oil remains as an oil sludge, and this is classically disposed of in the sea.I think we agree that ships have to dispose of garbage and residues in the ports.And from this follows - and there can actually be no other logic: The top priority for clean seas is that illegal disposal on the high seas is no longer allowed to be worthwhile.That's what it's about, and the majority we debated here.In January we had a very detailed debate about the consequences of ""Erika"" with you, Ms. Commissioner.We have collected all the points for ship safety and clean seas.And also with this guideline on port access systems for load residues, the question is how we get the seas cleaner.Just for information: We know that 70,000 m3 are disposed of in the North Sea alone in the North Sea in an illegal way, and we know the other way round that a maximum of 5 % to 10 % of the ships are now going properly, namely to dispose of their trash in the ports.This scandal is also not acceptable from the point of view of the council.The Council also says that all ports have to hold up the appropriate harbor access systems and have to be equipped with it.The conflict is ultimately about the question: How is paid?In its first reading, the parliament with a large majority said that it must be a significant contribution to the ships, namely at least 90 %.And that is the difference to the council that tells us that it must be a contribution.But a contribution can only be half a euro, and in this case God knows too little.Then nothing changes.There is no economic pressure for the ships to behave accordingly.A disposal flat rate for all ships, regardless of the actual use of the disposal facilities, is necessary, that is, the economic incentive for disposal at sea must be omitted, which-as it was already explained here-in the Baltic Sea-with the Helmkom Agreement, with the no-special feet system.What works there must also work for the remaining European seas, because it is not just about the environment, it is about clean water, it goes up to tourism, and - what is crucial - in addition to the environmental question, it is also about competition neutrality.The ships in the ports must all be able to comply with the same conditions, and only if Parliament, Council and Commission create these conditions together is this neutrality of competition for the ports and ships.I think it's also about the credibility of the Union and especially parliament.I think people are tired of experiencing disaster hypocrisy from Europe and the ministers, as we saw it in ""Erika""."	de
"There were examples in Spain: Michelin, ABB-Alstom, and there are examples in Italy that my colleagues will name.There is also another hidden formula of dismissal, and in Spain, for example, it is practiced by the ERICSSON company under the name ""outsourcing"" (precise words are avoided, such as the word ""release"").The outsourcing of services means commissioning services for contract companies, which means that stable and fixed jobs are canceled at any time, without union and social rights.In reality, this is another veiled form of discharge.Mr. Commissioner!If the European institutions believe in what they say about full employment, they have to take up clear measures: the guidelines to ensure the participation of the employees in these negotiations, reduce the directive on mass layoffs, to reduce working hours, bind the European subsidies to maintain jobs and bind the social and labor law clauses into the international benefits subordinate to the European Unionto record.Mr President, once again this parliament has to deal with the restructuring of companies in Europe.Once again, the workers are at risk of loss of their workplace.This time it is about Goodyear's employees in Cisterna di Latina.As already mentioned, around 600 employees and just as many families who could be robbed in a month of their only source of income are affected.Despite their accommodation and professionalism, thanks to whom the company in Cisterna is one of the most productive in Europe, these workers threaten the risk of being emitted from the production cycle, while the Goodyear company, after it has been received for years, can close the goals and completely unhindered.I really think that is unfair: unfair to the employees of the branch in Cisterna and unfair to all those citizens in Italy and the Union, which, albeit indirectly, have enabled taxear to enjoy this state aid.The European Commission and the Council must finally fully commit themselves to their responsibility, both in terms of acceptance of the common point of view regarding the information and hearing of the entrepreneurs and as far as the community grants and state subsidies are concerned, which are only to be granted to the conclusion of long -term agreements for the preservation of jobs.Today we ask the Commission to protect employees from the Goodyear branch in Cisterna and therefore exert every conceivable pressure on the company so that there is an agreement as soon as possible to ensure the continued existence and the further operation of the branch in Cistern.Finally, I would like to point out that Mr. President and Mr. Commissioner, that the time really urges and therefore all the measures that are considered - including those already mentioned by the Commissioner in his introductory words - must be taken immediately and in time.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!The European companies, if they continue to remain existence, undoubtedly want to adapt structurally in order to be able to better counter the new challenges.Today's economic background is quite aware of it, because the aim of the intended restructuring is to rationalize corporate management."	de
For this reason, in the future we must very seriously draw our attention to the actual establishment by the Member States of the systems, which we decide here together. Otherwise there should be some kind of sanctions so that we can bring things back to their right course. Mr President, I would like, like the preachers, to congratulate the rapporteur. He approached the issue with the belief that characterizes him with great dedication. I was happy to hear him say that there is no real conflict with the principles and goals of the proposed directive. I do not doubt that the Commissioner will help find a satisfactory solution because both Parliament and the Commission have a common goal about this very important and very critical area. The intra -Community bovine transactions directive is central to the financial survival of breeders, especially in my own country, in Ireland, where we export up to 90% of our total animal capital production - a very large proportion of live animals in mainland Europe. So I support the proposals for further updating the 1997 Directive, without prejudice that this must be done in a reasonable way. We need to eliminate the unnecessary bureaucracy, while at the same time providing complete detectability in relation to the movement of animal capital as well as safeguard public health. Mr President, this proposal establishes an extension of the current exemption by Directive 64/432 applicable to the Spanish government. Without this exception, it would be necessary to apply a system of veterinary controls for tuberculosis and brucellosis to any cattle extracted from its periphery. These checks, of course, are already implemented by many other states. This exception has a significant impact on my country. While an exception is given to Spain, the British meat industry is severely affected by the implementation of a related directive, which requires exterminating costs of veterinary controls in our slaughterhouses. So strict are the requirements for veterinary supervision that we do not have enough British veterinarians to carry out the project. Instead of giving us more time, however, the Commission has initiated proceedings for violations. In order not to end up in the European Court of Justice, my government had to hire a large number of EU veterinarians, 300 of whom came from Spain. If Spain has such a large surplus of veterinarians that it can send so many to my country, why is it so difficult to implement the veterinary control system required by that directive? It does not seem to me that the British slaughterhouses have to be tortured as a result of the committee's action, while Spain is allowed to defy its obligations. Why does the committee make it so much facilitated Spain? Should he ask why Spain can send so many veterinarians to the United Kingdom to implement a relevant directive and may even insist on remaining in their country some of these employees to apply Community law in their own country?	el
It has now turned out that the situation may become further deteriorated, as candidate states in Central and Eastern Europe are expected to increase the net export of pork by almost 300 % by 2006. At the same time, they request exceptions from the EU so that they can produce pork under current EU legislation under unlawful welfare and hygiene norms. In order for the United Kingdom to revitalize the dynamic trade of internal cattle and pigs, it is immediately necessary to help to alleviate the catastrophic situation in the UK, and especially the catastrophic situation in the pig and beef. I hope this message will be transmitted to the Great British Finance Minister. Mr President, I also agree with the rapporteur about these basic questions and, of course, I can agree with that check that the transition would only be two years. This is about neglecting the Member States in the implementation of these matters and the system. These are serious animal diseases, and I think the most important thing about this debate is that we need to quickly grasp the system in order to avoid a couple of times the provisions that would take effect. Stevenson mentioned that exports from Eastern Europe will increase;Friends good, we are now expanding the EU and are taking Eastern European countries into the EU. If our own systems are not in order, how can we require new Member States to be in a condition that they can agree and join our agricultural policy system? We emphasize that we must have food safety and a European agricultural model as a starting point and future, and we neglect to control the issues of the Member States to monitor systems to do so. Therefore, in the future, we need to pay very seriously that the Member States will actually take effect on the systems that we will jointly decide here. If this is not the case, there must be a sanction that can get these things properly. Mr President, like previous speakers, I would like to congratulate the presenter. He has approached this thing in a typical manner, convincingly and dedicated to it. I was delighted to hear that there is hardly any disagreement about the principles and objectives of the proposal for a directive. I am sure that a member of the Commission will help us find a satisfactory solution because both Parliament and the Commission have a common goal in this very important and central area. A directive on internal cattle trade is essential for the financial survival of cattle breeders, especially in my own country, in Ireland, where up to 90 percent of the total livestock production is taken away - a very large proportion of live animals exporting to continental Europe. In this sense, proposals for the 1997 Directive of the Directive, as long as it is made reasonably. We need to remove unnecessary bureaucracy while ensuring the complete traceability of cattle movements and to secure public health. Mr President, this proposal will continue the exemption arrangement currently applicable to the Spanish government on the provisions of the Directive 64/432. Without this exception, it should be forced to introduce a system of veterinary examinations for each cattle exported from its area. Such a system is already in use in many other states. This exceptional arrangement has significant consequences for my country. When an exceptional arrangement is applied to Spain, the Great British meat sector is greatly suffering from a directive related to this issue, which obliges to perform devastating expensive veterinary examinations in our slaughterhouses. The requirements for veterinary examinations are so harsh that we do not have enough British veterinarians to do this job. Instead of providing us with extra time, it has, however, brought about the violation of the violation. In order for my government to avoid entering the European Court of Justice, it must have hired large quantities of veterinarians in the EU, 300 of which are from Spain. If Spain once has so many extra veterinarians that it can afford to send so many of them my country, why is it so difficult to introduce the system of veterinary examinations required by this Directive?	fi
In this context, we are responsible for the whole of Africa, Africa to which we have given hope lately, to which we have addressed bids, but where nothing has yet been done; Africa in which in recent years has not been transitioned by the authoritarian regimes to democracy, but by the democracy. We also have another task internationally, a task already proposed by the Commissioner responsible for the Commissioner: the commitment to the reopening of the millennium round with the great willingness we have already shown and already proposed before Seattle, but that we could not do,but also at the level of unilateral opening in the trade of the poorest countries in the world. You need a different answer, otherwise episodes like those of Seattle will be repeated and prevent Europe from playing its positive role in history. Everywhere in the world, Europe's action must be directed by the great respect of the principles of freedom, respect for individual rights and rights of minorities. Let us not forget that we, the European Union, we are a Union of Minorities: We are all a minority in Europe. There are concerns inside the fifteen, concerns that may arise again in the next decade. I am talking about Austria, where the Commission remained faithful to its role, consistent in its efforts in favor of the Union's cohesion, but rigid and guardian of the conditions, ready to condemn the slightest violation of the principles of democracy, law and respect for minorities. Some have criticized me for the congratulatory message I sent to the Chancellor Schoessel. And I tell you: Do not consider that the necessary and proper formal courtesy means less decisive content. Re -read the letter: Restoration of the fundamental values ​​of the Union derives - and not by accident - from Article 6 of the Treaty, I repeat from Article 6. And I still ask you: Do you think that another European Government leader ever heard the committee to remind him of these principles? This is what we want to do: to maintain our role as a supranational structure, to maintain the role that the conditions have given us, but also to be irrelevant to the principles and to judge on the basis of the facts. Last November, the Commission presented a proposal for a directive against racism. I ask the Council to approve the fastest and I ask parliament to help us in this action, which deepen the fundamental foundations of our social cohesion. And I conclude in the end, reminding the last two points of our program: the economy and the quality of life. I already talked about the economy: We know well what the key ingredients are to push Europe on the way of a recovery capable of lasting a long time and eventually creating jobs. We must still contain inflation at low levels, to ensure more and more competition, promote the dissemination of information technologies and all new technologies; to promote science, the borders of science, to have the pleasure of being at the border of science.	el
With regard to arrangements for assistance to the West Balkans of the European Union, the members know that we will create a new provision to simplify and streamline the administration of the arrangements and to make everything under one provision. I am aware that in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, Macedonia and elsewhere are concerned about the end of the Phare program in these countries, and especially the loss of association related to the name of the Phare. I am concerned about what the members have said about this situation. I look again, but I should point out that maintaining and implementing two Phare programs can cause a real confusion. However, I would like to emphasize that despite the program, our commitment to integrate the former Republic of Yugoslavia Macedon and its neighboring countries to the European family is stronger than ever. In general, I believe that other members of the Parliament are also pleased that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively quickly. I hope other countries in the area multiply their efforts to go through a similar process. I look forward to several similar discussions over the following years;I hope that we succeed in our efforts in the Balkans, which is the most important single lacquer test for me to determine what Europe can do at its own home door. Much thanks, dignity of the Commission member Patte. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered tomorrow at 12 noon. The Commitology Agreement on the agenda is the following Frasson's Committee on Basic Contracts, Rules of Procedure and Institutions (A5-0021/2000) on the Agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the proceedings by the Council of 28 June 1999 (1999/468/EC).about detailed rules..(IT) President, adopting an agreement with the Commission on the detailed rules on the application of the Council's new decision (Commitology) ends with a case that has been affected by Parliament and some enthusiasts who have spread to various European Union institutions and who are not hesitated to call masochists. Since 1993, the procedure for the enforcement of the Commission, and in particular the mysterious and even suspicious activities of the Commission, have led to controversial situations and distrust between the institutions and were in danger of causing serious consequences for legislative proceedings. For this reason, as a result of the Declaration of the Convention on Amsterdam, the European Union's institutions began a diverse negotiation and hearing work, which resulted in the new Council's new decision, where it is certainly not completely satisfactory. In particular, the decision brings an outline of Parliament's supervision, that is, the ability to play emergency bells in the event that a law derived from the legal procedure approved by a joint decision is violated by the executive power granted to the Commission. During the long negotiations between the institutions, the parliament has been actively involved in the report of the report by Adelaide Aglietta, the report of the European Parliament and the Commission had entered into an inter -bodies' agreement on the detailed rules for the application of the new decisions. In this way, it would have been possible to determine some of the factors that the Council had no intention to bring again to the decision, and on the other hand, this could have provided more precisely the information system and the control system for enforcement. During the third dialogue on October 6, 1999 in Strasbourg, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission was promptly accepted the idea of ​​concluding the agreement concerned. I believe that we have done our job, which, however, proved to be quite easy thanks to the atmosphere of trust and mutual respect, a atmosphere that marked all negotiations with the Commission. There are essentially two points highlighted in the Agreement: on the one hand, the prerequisite for the actual use of the actual intervention of the European Parliament referred to in Article 8 of the decision is that it is notified. Until now, the information has been provided on paper and not in a systematic way, and often it has also been the responsibility of the Parliament, which has not been useful to our units.	fi
It is not up to you that it is the responsibility of deciding on this, it is up to us to do so.This too is linked to the new consciousness that this parliament of itself.I would like to discuss this with you, no more, no less.We can save ourselves any other foray, in any area whatsoever, and I respect you as a serious commissioner who wants to seriously fulfill his work.I beg you to respect us as deputies wanting to seriously pay theirs, of which the Tobin tax is also part.Madam President, it seems that there is a forgetfulness and that, in the list of resolutions deposited, which have just been mentioned by yourself, it has not been reported on the proposal for a compromise of compromise common to the PSE, the Liberals, the Gue, the Greens, and the Mrs. Kuntz and Mr. Cyeaux.Dear colleague, I take note of your declaration and the existence of this common resolution.If the presidency services confirm that it is well deposited, it goes without saying that it is taken into account.The debate is closed.The vote will take place Thursday at 12 noon.(The session is lifted at 8:14 p.m.) Adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting, Mr. President, I simply wanted to disseminate information: a terrorist attack took place this morning in Madrid.It was a car trapped.There was a dead man.I simply wanted, on behalf of my group, to condemn these terrorist acts once again.Thank you very much, Madame Fraga.We were indeed informed of this unfortunate event.Assassin terrorism unfortunately, once again, struck Spanish society;The presidency joins forces with a particular intensity with your intervention, you will understand it, since the presidency of this session is also Spanish.(The minutes are adopted) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which had been interrupted on Friday January 21, 2000. The president, let me remember that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermès tragedy.Indeed, two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American plane from the NATO base located in Aviano, stretched, during a low altitude exercise - below the safety limits -, the cables of a cable car, causing the death of more than twenty European citizens.The families of the victims, who did not feel that justice has been made as soon as the responsible pilot did not incur the slightest sentence, at least expect from the United States, rapid economic compensation.I therefore invite the president of this assembly and the chairman of the commission to guarantee, alongside the American authorities, immediate compensation, to defend the rights of the families of the victims.Madam, thank you and I take note of your intervention.Agenda The agenda calls for the fixing of the work order.Following the request which was sent to me in this sense by several political groups and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents that we have just had, I suggest you include a debate of an hour and a half on a news problem, urgent and major importance, in accordance with article 50 of our rules, relating to the reaction of the Union with regard to government negotiations in Austria.	fr
Third, of course, I understand very well that the health aspects of this issue are very important. I will repeat what Lindgren, Professor of Lund University, said, that is, what happens to import restrictions, alcohol consumption in Sweden remains the same. Of course, the question arises, which then becomes the amount of alcohol that does not come with passengers. The answer is that it is smuggled or that the Swedes make it themselves, and as member Andersson knows, it is a particularly dangerous and unhealthy procedure. Member Andersson seems to think that the health situation will improve if we restrict the import of alcohol, but in that case, not only Sweden, but not all Member States of the European Union must consider the principle that alcohol sales are completely banned. We have seen an example in the United States. Andersson probably knows what was once a prohibition law. He also knows what consequences it had for the mafia in the United States, where the Prohibition Act was eventually abolished. All this means that health must naturally be protected, but not by prohibiting alcohol because it does not help. Mr President, however, is actually a matter of revenue from Swedish alcohol monopoly, and when the Swedish government says it has to cover health expenditure with this monopoly, it is of course proof that this monopoly is a distortion of competition, as other countries have to fund their health spending themselves. My question concerns whether you also know the studies that, for example, high quality alcohol, such as Frankian wine or Bavarian beer, even promotes health, thus making the Swedish state economy even lighter. I understand that a member of Pulselt referred to the taxable aspects of this. As far as I know, the high tax on alcoholic products in Sweden dates back to 1638 and since then the state has received a significant share of its tax revenue on the sale of alcohol products. As is known in Sweden, it is now a state monopoly, which in itself is again in conflict with Union legislation. When it comes to the healing effect of alcohol - I think Pulsel also dealt with it -, I totally agree with him: I think a bottle of good wine can be very good in terms of health and also a socially very pleasant thing, and maybe the members of Plyselt and Andersson and I can meet during these parliamentary bar and drink a glass of aquavit together. Mr President, I listened to an interest in a member of the Commission's member that the uniform market rules must be applied. Could he say whether he thinks that the answer is in harmony with the fact that the Commission has not been able to challenge the French government to the European Court of Justice, even though the vineyard law applied by France in practice prevents the application of uniform market rules to the sale of alcohol products in France? Can we now expect the European Commission to bring an action against the French Republic in the European Court of Justice? I would like to respond very briefly to the question of a valuable member, as the Commission is currently actively addressing this issue. The Commission must decide whether the matter has been dealt with or whether the Commission should be taken to the court of the European Communities. My answer may not be satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the Member that the Commission will decide on this in the coming weeks. I ask a member to understand the minor decision of the Commission's decision. Member of the Commission, do you have any reason for public health that, for example, the taxation of a Scottish whiskey or French Bordeaux or even my colleague Bavarian beer is different? Do you consider applying the same tax base to alcohol in Europe? The issue of excise duties to which the Member refers to is the right of the Member State concerned. The Commission has no tools to reduce or raise excise duties on alcohol products or any products. Towards the end of this year, the Commission will provide a report of the differences between the excise duties charged by the Member States.	fi
To justify this, we invoke the next enlargement of the Union.It surprises me because it is a bad interpretation.A federal and centralist EU which always directs the Member States is in fact less likely to expand.A flexible EU which focuses on less numerous, but essential areas that respects national differences and national democracies is more likely to encompass many more countries.To the point D of the proposal for resolution, a more effective and more transparent economic policy is required at the level of the EU.However, it is impossible to talk about this without speaking of the monetary union.In the current text, nothing is said of the big democratic and political problems linked to the monetary union and the central bank - it is not defensible.If you want to have a more democratic EU, you have to review the entire design of the UEM.The central bank must be placed under political control so that monetary policy can be led by a political objective such as the growth of employment or well-being;For this, the transparency of the central bank must be improved.The fixed and failed monetarism of the stability pact must be re-examined and rejected, if we want to be able to have a homogeneous policy which places the objective of well-being in the foreground.Article 56 of the Treaty, which prohibits any intervention in the free movement of capital, monetary speculation, must be deleted so that dangerous monetary speculations are refronted thanks to political control.Most EU countries today have governments dominated by Social Democrats.It is remarkable that none of them requires a change in the orientation of the monetary union, now that they have the possibility.The fact of declaring that the monetary union could constitute a counterweight to the globalization of capital also does not affect credibility.In resolution, the European Parliament is required to obtain greater power over the intergovernmental conference.However, it is important to emphasize that the intergovernmental conference is and must be a conference between the Member States.It is the Parliament of the Member States, or of the people in popular votes, which must direct the development of the treaty.It is therefore excluded that the European Parliament is given any formal influence in the negotiation or ratification process.Mr. President, the Constitutional Affairs Committee presented a substantially positive text for which I will vote, even if I myself introduced several enlargement amendments.However, what happened in recent days shows that all those who have expressed substantive criticism of how the expansion and revision of the treaties were organized were right.We cannot envisage a union of twenty-eight member states without facing the question of whether Europe shares certain principles, certain common values, if it is reduced to an economic zone of free exchange or if, on the contrary, it has a greater aspiration: to be a supranational union, according to aspects to be defined, also eager to draw a new path of civilization and democracy in the world.	fr
In our opinion, the Lisbon European Council should rather try to eliminate these inflexibility, favor flexibility and adaptation, and exchange positive national experiences to promote creativity that only thrives through the freedom of choice of peoples. The Mr President, the Mr President of the Council, the good colleagues, the speeches we hear here are the lofty goal, namely the fact that we Europeans must become competitive in the United States that we need to develop into equal partners alongside the United States. In fact, this should be possible when looking at GDP. On the other hand, if we follow, for example, in personal matters - when it comes to finding a new chairman of the world's currency fund - the attitude of Europeans to Americans, then at least without doubt, we are still very far from equal partnership. We now have to ask what this is. After all, there are areas where we are financially - even in the field of new communication tools - at the top. Let's mention this, for example, mobile phones. Here in the plenary hall, we have properly denied them because they are the right pieces of teasing. At the same time, however, they are also significant in many areas, as they create jobs. And we Europeans are leading in this area. Why are we? We are leading because we have succeeded in making a common European Code, a common European standard that has now become the norm in the world. This means that if we Europeans assemble our strength in time, then we will be competitive in this area of ​​new technologies. Where, then, are the weaknesses of Europe? Mr President of the Council, I think that we cannot replace those shortcomings by setting up new observation tracks, as is currently planned. I believe that these observation organs will create a few few jobs for officials, but they do not create jobs for small and medium -sized businesses. We in Europe have shortcomings in education. This is reflected in the fact that we have to bring products outside Europe in the field of new communication tools. Europe is missing, as already stated, entrepreneurship, entrepreneurial spirit. There are too few young people who want to take the risk of independent entrepreneurship. We are too inflexible to organize work forms, organize work. If more rigid rules are created here, such as in France, which is introducing a rigid 35 hour work week, I am convinced that this can be made short -term, but over time, this is a disadvantage for our competitiveness and in the long term jobs. We in Europe are also far from common domestic markets. We have 15 different domestic market areas and one of the co-European internal markets. We need common, clear European rules for electronic trading. We need a European patent for a reasonable price, as we are still missing. This European patent is so expensive that it is not competitive in relation to other patents. We need a common European limited liability company, not to mention that we have to adapt to the new conditions of our social security system, as this is also the basis for what we call a social model, namely the social market economy for Europe. Mr President, I would like to thank Guterres, Chairman of the Council for his such speech and also for his initiative on Lisbon, which is very important to us. If we are honest, we have to admit that the journey from Luxembourg to Lisbon has been very long and that we are now looking forward to concrete achievements, that something really achieves at the Lisbon Summit. The gallery has a lot of Europeans tonight, and I wonder what they think about our discussion. I would like them to have the idea that the European Union's institutions have now begun a real process that once again resulted in full employment in the European Union. There are many challenges to achieve full employment. Some of these challenges are extremely difficult to determine, but most importantly, we move on from the jewelery phrases we use many many years - from full employment, society promoting society, innovation and knowledge and skills - to the acts.	fi
The best way to create fertile ground for democracy in this war -torn region of Europe is trade and economic integration. We liberals are willing to go away and do it quickly, just as Paolo Costa said. We therefore express our great satisfaction for this proposed plan of stabilizing and connecting with Macedonia and thank Mr Swoboda for his excellent report. FYROM is worth our support, especially given the selfless and altruistic work offered by the Macedonian population and its leader in the Kosovo war. Now that FYROM is liberated by the devastating bonds of communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act clearly and offer our support. Just as we should do for the other Balkan countries. It is an urgent duty of the EU. Mr. President, let me, in this context, remind the MPs - in particular the debate that we will have later in the afternoon - that the man responsible for war, human humiliation, slaughter and displacement. This man accused of genocide and who should be referred before the Hague Criminal Court is still free. I'm talking about Milosevic. As much as Milosevic is still here and Serbia does not follow the path of democracy, so will Serbia be a permanent threat to peace across the Balkans - as well as in FYROM. Mr President, the promoted agreement will be the first application of the Stability Pact in Southeast Europe. Certainly its terms, which the Swoboda exhibition accepts, do not aim for peace but in greater political and economic manipulation of the country, controlling its natural wealth, over -exploitation of labor force and further use of this country as a base against the countries and peoples of the new region. And all this in return for the promise of future accession to the European Union. The report accepts these directions, as well as the general policy of the European Union for Southeast Europe. It is noteworthy that the exhibition congratulates FYROM for the constructive attitude it held during the NATO attack, the praise of its peacekeeping role is knitted because it accepted the parking of the NATO forces in its territory, of course its indignation was silenced by its indignation. Finally, because we consider that both the stability pact and the process of stabilizing and connecting the European Union for the countries of the region will create new problems in the region, new suffering to peoples and further enhance the hegemonic role of American and European imperialists, we will vote against the report by expressing the report. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, one of the main objectives of the European Union's stabilization and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the consolidation of stability and peace in the region, which, of course, presupposes the development and maintenance of good relationships.	el
"For the light of the events of the past few days, we may wonder what these intergovernmental conferences and these changes in the treaty will be used, when the heads of state and government - in reality, the European Council - take a position in relation to a sovereign Member State by intervening in the democratic process of this Member State.Everyone is free to have their own opinions on Mr. Haider - Personally, I consider him a very dangerous political figure - but we do not have to intervene in the democratic process of a sovereign and friend country.During intergovernmental conferences and when we will re -examine the modifications to be made to the treaty, we will have to take into account the fact that the EU evolves every day, in particular, as we have just seen, in a way contrary to the treaty.I welcome, in this enclosure, this afternoon, at Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency this afternoon.February 14 will see the launch of the CIG which will end by the end of the year 2000. The task is enormous but it can be accomplished.I think that all the groups present here this afternoon generally agree that the agenda of Helsinki will not be enough to cover the reform necessary to prepare Europe for enlargement.In other words, we have to go further than the important ""Amsterdam reliquates"".These include the extension of the qualified majority voting - we accept this in my country, except in the fields relating to taxation - the respondation of the vote within the Council in order to promote the largest states, and the number of commissioners in an enlarged Europe.Regarding the last point, Ireland wants the right to appoint a full -fledged member and without discrimination within the Commission, regardless of the number of Member States that adhere to Europe.We are willing to consider responding to votes within the Council of Ministers, provided that the largest member states accept that each member state has a full member and without discrimination within the Commission.When I lift this specific point, I know that I speak in the name of a large number of smaller states.During the CIG, we should also debate the possible sharing of the treaties in two parts a political field and a field relating to the Constitution.We are ready to accept this sharing if it does not limit the control that the smallest member states had in the renegotiation of all the policies of the treaty.In other words, if we are not fully represented in the Commission, we will not contribute to political discussions.So we follow all this question very closely.We are delighted with the idea of ​​the charter of fundamental rights and impatiently await its content.Mr. President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set the number of deputies in the European Parliament at 700 and we must debate, within the Parliament, in the way in which these 700 seats will be distributed within extended Europe.Mr. President, I fervently recommend the adoption of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution.This clearly expresses not only our disappointment in the face of the insufficiency of the agenda, but also our desire to see the intergovernmental conference stand as soon as possible."	fr
"However, with the directives and checks, the number of these products will soon increase from six to seven, then eight and nine, until they also accept soy, rape and genetically modified organisms. We are also told that the cocoa is delimited to 5 % ... At first, then to 10 %, and it has not been taken into account that no controls are practiced, such as Chiquita banana boxes, which have to be printed 18 kg and actually weigh 20 kg. Moreover, control is of no use because we are told that the margin of error is 1 %, even though scientists tell us that it is in fact 40 %. We are said in particular that we should snack, drink and swallow without fear, because the products have a label protecting us. However, the label is a graphic cheating because it is impossible to read, and scientific pretending because, for example, palm oil mention is drowned in the ingredient list. As the port wine says it is a fake in South Africa, cocoa does not say that it is fake. Thus, in the absence of the criteria needed to qualify for chocolate fraud, multinational companies say that a 5 % increase in vegetable fats is acceptable, otherwise the fraud is perfect. And what about? It is sufficient that the product is called ""butter fat"" in the case of butter oil, and ""soy"", in the case of soy, but its name cannot be ""chocolate"". For example, 388,000 tonnes of French chocolate must be made from cocoa, and for example, the turnover of 19 billion francs generated by French chocolate production must be honestly earned by craftsmen. This is a legal obligation to the elephant coast and the African farmers. For us, we are bound by the Lomé Convention and the Convention on Basic Products to which the European Union has joined. This is also a financial obligation: if we do not comply with it, we have an obligation to replace the losses of these countries through the Stabex system. It is a duty of public health and food safety, as products that replace cocoa, such as Brazilian walnut, can cause immunological diseases. Finally, it is also the truth and the moral. We have to run out of lying everywhere, because it all starts with the wrong chocolate and ends with an incorrect European Commission, whose members are American -modified organisms and sail under a comfort flag that hides a global merchant. Mr President, the Member of the Commission, genetically modified organisms and crazy cows were not enough to calm the enthusiasm of food manipulators. Man continues to play with fire and struggling with food safety. So now, according to the will of industrial lobbyists, we have a chocolate that has added vegetable fats. Chocolate cocoa content decreases by 15 %, but it can still be called chocolate. This is the problem. Transparency is obviously lacking and may be separated from margarine. The reverse side of the package is added to a negligible mention of the new composition of the product. Of course, this means not only quality but also the weakening and obvious product scams. It means fraudulent competition because this substitute, this false chocolate, is sold cheaper than pure chocolate made handmade and respecting authenticity, ethics and tradition. However, it also offers a prospect of high -profile multinational companies that have been behind the scenes for about 15 years to achieve their goals, that is, to reach a situation where exceptions to the union's consecutive expansion become a general rule. In contrast, it means worries about chocolate craftsmen and cocoa developing countries, for which the payment of compensation is seriously considered. In the end, I mention a significant problem: even though we are currently able to detect the vegetable fats in chocolate, we are still unable to identify them and we will not assess them in quantitative terms. So there is no traceability, and this provides free hands for all kinds of abuse."	fi
"We have human causes, causes of children's age limits, for example, we cannot accept the 14 -year age limit. We have solved all these problems with the Parliament's resolution. For us, for my party group, it is, of course, very important to know how seriously you take us as a parliament and how you treat our proposals, and ultimately we hope that we can tell us proud and happy that our cooperation is great. The question is whether you are tilted to us when we have concerns about this area and we necessarily need your support! Mr President, Monitoring Commission members, Mr President of the Council, a debate on the implementation of the Eurodac and the implementation of the Eurodac system, is like ever an endless story. It all started with Dublin in 1990. We members of the Parliament thought in November 1999, and I also assume you, the Member of the Commission, to think that we are close to the goal, that is, we could finally implement Eurodac. The goals have been settled several times, and in the end, we have considered it really positive, although I was really - what rarely happens - you will be happy with your estimation that you would not accept post -voting checks that had been decided by a qualified majority in Parliament. This may also have been considered a very positive thing. All in all, I would have been happy to introduce this system. The reason is simple: the Dublin Convention can only be enforced through this system, as it can be used to reinforce the competence of the Member State responsible for the performance of the asylum procedure, which would also result in a certain degree of exertion. In addition, this system allows us to prevent many simultaneous applications for asylum and at the same time the abuse of asylum, and possibly also to indirectly combat crime. This means that the system must be considered very positive and absolutely essential in matters relating to asylum and immigration policies and the responsibility of the Member States. I found it shocking that, however, the Council then made our plans empty at a meeting on 2 December, when it did not agree that the enforcement powers would remain by the Commission, that is, the competent committee of Member States could operate under the Commission. As a result, we did not eventually reach the goal we wanted, namely, to communify the system, but that the Council made our plans empty in the sense that it in a way it reported its control. As a result, the Commission cannot control this tool in the interest of the community, but the Council will remain in its loneliness again, and the Commission is thus displaced and eventually the parliament has been excluded. We do not want to accept such an arrangement, as it also has such widespread consequences that the efficiency of the system could not ultimately be monitored that the statistical studies required for analysis and the necessary follow -up would no longer be possible and that the implementation would be delayed anyway, which cannot be accepted. My question to you is: When can we now seriously trust that the Eurodac system we have been waiting for for so long will be functional? What will this system in the end be in concrete terms? Do we take into account the rules and our hopes that the Commission is tasked with the full implementation of the system? If this is the case, we would have reached the goal we had really needed then, then we would then have been European to the European part of the whole, because it makes sense to implement cooperation in this context. Mr President, Mr Members of the Parliament, I will answer the questions I have asked immediately, so that we avoid all kinds of doubts about the council's attitude and because I think it is important to find out properly. Speaking of the application of the Euraodac system, I would remind me that Article 1 of the draft regulation on the establishment of this system is very clear, so I read the text: ""Creating Eurodac's well-known system to help determine the state that responds in accordance with the Dublin Treaty"", ""Dublin, in accordance with the TreatyImplementing in the sense of this regulation. """	fi
In fact, the issue is to strengthen executive power, promote the annexation of Eastern countries to liberalism, and the new impetus to Europe's militarization, mainly by increasing the budget for military spending. Social Europe, which the EU was constantly claiming, is completely absent from the agenda. All of this certainly legitimizes growth on a European scale of resistance movements that seek to establish a social map that will harmonize the main claims of workers from above. That is why I vote against the report. I have been in favor of the resolution giving the consent of the convening of the ICC, as it confirms the spirit of the Portuguese Presidency, supported by a vast majority of parliament, in the direction of inclusion in the agenda of the TSD and other issues,Great, as initially provided for the order given by the Helsinki Council. Unfortunately, however, among the issues including the various resolutions and concern the funds of the European Union Treaty that may be revised in the future, at least nowhere is the need to review Article 7 of the Treaty, which provides for the suspension of the rights of a Member State in the eventIn Article 6. As highlighted by the current crisis we live in with Austria, the Union has every right to defend it. However, the legal mechanisms laid down in the Treaty are powerless, difficult to apply from both political and legal perspective, do not define the responsibilities of the institutions and do not guarantee the appeal to judicial bodies to examine a major case concerning the condemnation of a majority. For this reason, I think that this issue should urgently be included in the DD agenda, since it alone justifies a broad reform. The issues of major importance that in our opinion are raised on the carrier in view of the convergence of an intergovernmental conference far beyond the confrontation that has erupted here in the range of the agenda of that intergovernmental, or not to submit to the erection of the day. Parliament in the DD. We believe that the essential issues have to do with the feasibility of the convergence of the IMF and the goals it is looking for, as well as the issues that will definitely be raised at the discussion table. We doubt the expediency because we are afraid of the goals that are actually being sought, which are probably far from the ever -mentioned adaptation in view of the forthcoming enlargement. This is evidenced in particular from the specific content that is sketched, in particular the cases that have remained pending after Amsterdam - which prescribes the future establishment of unacceptable Directorates - but also by the content of the sectors that are included in the second and third pillar of the European Union.	el
With one of the great accidents in recent times, the cargo itself was not dangerous.The margarine and a few kilos of color, which in principle not a risk, caused a real catastrophe.Therefore, it must be checked how the requirements for ensuring a maximum of security can still be optimized.In conclusion, I would like to say that it is about security for all types of transport.This week we will make a pronunciation about the security of maritime traffic due to the catastrophe of Erika, and we will also have to discuss the security goals in air traffic in the course of this year.I want to express that security is a primary goal of the Commission.As I will say in the pronunciation about the Erika, we are not waiting for a disaster to deal with the security aspect, but we are working on the sidelines of these events.However, these show us the urgency of an effective answer to problems of this kind.I would like to thank all speakers and especially the rapporteur, Mr. Koch.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.The report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr. Koch follows on the road on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Foreign Affairs for a Directive of the European Parliament and the Council (KOM (1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083 (COD)) to change the Directive 94/55/EC to adjust the legal provisions for the member stateDangerous goods transport on the street.President, dear wife commissioner, dear colleagues!The guideline that came into force on January 1, 1997 for the adjustment of the legal provisions of the Member States for dangerous goods transport on the street contains some transitional regulations, the validity of which is limited and linked to the conclusion of certain standardization work of the CEN, i.e. the European Committee for Standardization.Delayed delays in the work of the CEN now lead to problems when using this guideline.In particular, attachments cannot be adapted according to technical and industrial development.I regret this because we have to work because others have not done their work.In this respect, I accept the present proposal to change the Directive 94/55/EC.A non -acting of the European Union would oblige the Member States to change their domestic legal provisions for a short period of time, namely until the CEN's work is concluded, which causes unnecessary costs and uncertainties.The change in the directive on today's agenda does not change the harmonization of dangerous goods transport in the community.It only extends transitional rules by moving appointments, it no longer strokes provisions, and it regulates the procedures for a) ad HOC transports of dangerous goods as well as b) the decree of less strictly national regulations, especially in the transport of very low amount of dangerous goods on locally strictly limited areas.The change of the directive is therefore in the sense of subsidiarity;Member States receive more powers.The EU Commission decides whether the Member States can issue certain regulations.It is supported by an expert committee for dangerous goods transport according to the regulatory procedure.The modalities for the exercise of these implementation powers assigned to the Commission were re -regulated by the council decision of June 1999.	de
I mean the position that the Austrian government will take to the Council to the Commission's proposals to create a discrimination program and to set up two related directives. One directive applies the principle of equality to the treatment of people, regardless of the breed or ethnic origin, and another directive provides jobseekers with protection against discrimination on the basis of ethnic or racial origin, religion, disability or sexual orientation. Thus, it is essential legal texts that are accepted under Article 13 of the Treaty, which is granted a competence to combat the breed, ethnic origin, gender and other. Finally, I would like to assure the member that the Commission will monitor the situation as alert and will surely take its responsibility if necessary. I thank the member of the Commission for his answer to my answer. However, I would ask if a member of the Commission is aware of not only the words of Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party, but also for their actions. In fact, Jörg Haider has been on the government of the Kärnten State in the south, where he has conducted a racist and migratory hate campaign against a minority of the region with an Austrian citizenship and has tried to abolish bilingual teaching and have clearly discriminated against Roma and immigrant communities. I would like a Commission member to answer two questions. First of all, he talked about showing true. Can he tell us how the true screen happens and who does it? Secondly, he does not believe that if the current government were pursuing a national level of policies by Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party at a regional level, Article 6 (1) of the Treaty would be violated in terms of fundamental freedoms and human rights and the Commission would have the obligation to take the necessary steps? We are not talking about words here. We are talking about the actions of the Freedom Party and Jörg Haider. In my opinion, it is quite clear that the Commission's responsibility is to closely monitor the development of the situation in the Member States in accordance with the procedures and standards provided for in Article 6 and to justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty. Thus, I fully trust that the Commission is able to monitor the development of the situation in Austria, as well as in any other Member State. If it turns out that the government of a Member State is constantly violating human rights, we are able to fully react and act as required. In addition, I rely not only on cooperation between members of the European Parliament but also for cooperation between NGOs. NGOs have always promoted a significant contribution to the anti -discrimination policy. With regard to the situation in Kärnten, we need to look at the matter in detail. A Member of the question raised the question. Protecting ethnic minorities and minorities speaking their own language is part of the program and the two directives that the Commission has given to the Council. We should not focus on Austria's question in this debate. That question requires consideration, discussion and, if necessary, act. I sincerely hope that all Member States will use the events provided by this action plan and the two directives provided by the Commission to the Council and repeat clearly and concretely that they accept the action plan and directives, and that they are committed to rejecting discrimination, racism and strangers, where they occur. Much thanks, the Commission member Vitorino, for your significant contribution during this Question Time. Second part of the Commission Member of Wallström Question 41 (H-0021/00): Subject: Waste of electrical equipment and electronic devices The annual amount of waste from electrical equipment and electronic devices in the European Union is constantly increasing (6 million tons in 1998). Environmental problems related to the burning and landfill of these devices are mainly due to the hazardous substances they contain (lead, cadmium, mercury, spruce chrome, PVC and halogens to prevent the burning of halogens). Three consecutive versions of the preliminary presentation of these waste treatment have been made, the last of which dates back to July 1999. Can the Commission explain why this project has been dealt with for so long, even though it had to be completed in principle in 1998?	fi
"As a result, Wednesday's agenda would have two statements on the Council: the consistency of the Union's development policy and other politics, and the next meeting of the UN Human Rights Committee, followed by a joint debate on Cyprus, Corrie, Frasson and Kynorr Borràs. Does anyone want to justify this request on behalf of these groups? As no one wants to make a speech, I will make a vote on this request.(Parliament accepted the request.) Thursday: President. There have been several changes in the discussion on important, current and urgent topics. Two additions have been requested at the human rights point: the liberal group has requested to be added to ""Cambodia"" and the Greens have requested to add the sub -""Pinochet"". As you know, only five topics can be selected for human rights. There are already four topics on the list of the final agenda. So we can add only one point to it. Does anyone want to justify a request for the sub -""Cambodia"" on behalf of the liberal group? Mr President, the liberal group is very important that the situation in Cambodia is talked about and that is what happens right now. This is not only important because the Secretary -General of the United Nations Kofi Annan wrote a letter to the Cambodian government in order to eventually establish a special court to bring the Reds' leaders to be held accountable, but also because Prime Minister Hun Sen's power machinery, which is not known to be murdered by attempts at Sam. Parliamentary immunity so that this can simply be made for justice. The international community has asked to take responsibility for what is happening in Cambodia. In the end, we have accepted the Cambodian elections, while at the same time the observation of the election failed. Only this parliament became somewhat respectable. In my opinion, as a parliament, we now also need to take our responsibility and express our opinion on the situation in Cambodia.(Parliament accepted the request.) President. The sub -cambodia is added to the point of human rights, which is why a request to increase the sector of the stacks of the pinoche will lapse. In addition, I have requested requests to add new points to the topical debate. Thus, it is no longer a matter of adding new sub -points to the human rights point, but about adding completely new points. Three requests have been submitted: the first has been submitted by a group of the united left, who wants to add a paragraph: ""postponing the enforcement of the death penalty in the United States and Betty Bets case"";The second request was made by a liberal group who wants to add the point: ""Pinochet case"";And the third request is made by the Green Group and they want to add the point: ""The environmental disaster associated with the Danube water"". When we take into account the time we have available and, as you know, the agenda will have a Commission's statement on industrial reorganization, and since there are currently two points in the current debate, we can add two new points. I will first submit a vote on the request of the Left.(Parliament rejected the request.) President. Next, we will discuss the liberal group request. Does anyone want to make a speech on behalf of this request? Mr President, it is remarkable that the European Parliament has so far not commented on the possible release of Pinochet, even though international arrest powers have been issued. As the Belgian Government's appeal to a higher court was decided last week, and since the final decision has not yet been made, it is important that the Parliament will finally provide a serious signal that must include that no one can avoid honest trial. It is impossible to think that the European Parliament, which has justifiably paid so much attention to respect for human rights, would not clearly express its opinion. Mr President, this is too serious to deal with now in an urgent procedure. First, the European Parliament has already issued a statement on General Pinochet, but we now have to remember many things. The first is that this topic is still unresolved in several European countries, and I remind my colleagues that there is no common European jurisdiction or European legislation yet."	fi
Of course, we must not issue any content provisions, but I still demand that Parliament preserves and even expands its rights in accordance with Maastricht and Amsterdam's agreements. I am very worried that we once again get an agency that flies through Europe, like an anonymous satellite. I would love the agency in the same way as the devil's wedding water. I hope this won't happen! I, too, have a positive view of the White Book. However, do you expect the Food Agency to have enough influence to prevent, for example, the beef war we visit and that France refuses to eliminate the ban on imports? You mentioned that the Commission will be able to refuse the grants and support from countries that do as France does. Would you also suggest that the Commission could, for example, provide temporary compensation, such as British growers now? Mr President;Member of the Commission, you said at the last week's press conference that you are not perceived that the upcoming EU Food Agency should not be placed in periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery is. For example, the activities of the EU unit in Dublin have shown that physical distance is not a barrier to effective influence and communication today. Data collection, publishing and coordination, making recommendations for food safety and - as you stated - the collection of scientific knowledge and the popularization of information for consumers have been proposed as the most important tasks of the future Food Authority. All of this is handled through modern technology from any region of the European Union. I ask, where do you start your understanding of the location?.(EN) The composition of the authority: First, it is employed by researchers who cooperate and receive advice from researchers who are experts in the field in question. In addition, the food safety authority has a board of directors. You will find that we have not specified the composition of the board in the White Book. I expect this question to be discussed between Parliament and the Commission in the coming weeks and months. I plan to make the membership of the Board of Directors consist of the parties or their representatives. Its task must be explained in detail in the proposal I will give to the Commission in September. We haven't done it yet, but it will be done in September. I do not believe that the board can in any way guide researchers in how they should do their job. It would weaken the independence of scientific advice. However, it could, for example, require the authority to investigate certain areas that should be investigated. Member of the Parliament Florenz asked if Parliament had a say. We need to consider it and discuss it. It may have different views. Some may be of the opinion that it would not be appropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or even the candidates appointed by Parliament - to be members of the board. Others may think that it would be useful if Parliament had an opportunity to discuss what questions should be discussed through the candidates he or she appointed or even Parliament themselves. This is to be considered, but it is not excluded. Member of the Parliament Florenz also raised the issue of anonymity. I am glad he raised it because it is particularly important that this authority has a high profile. It must be visible. It must be known. Consumers of the European Union need to know that there is a food authority. The authority of the authority would be a well -known person who might regularly appear on television to talk about food -related issues, in particular good food news in the field of nutrition, diet and similar issues, so that consumers are aware of the existence of the authority when new food crises are aware of the existence of new food crises. They are aware that they have heard of the authority in some other context, and hopefully they have already had some basic confidence in the statements made by the authority. It is therefore absolutely essential that the authority is not anonymous. It must be visible. I do everything I can promote the high profile of the authority. Member of the Parliament Lynne asked if the authority had enough influence.	fi
I believe that the acquisition and support of statistics is politically very important and that the opportunity to set goals, compare results, and strengthen our efforts is a good political tool. Such an initiative for systematic monitoring is also included in my own program when developing a fifth program for women. It has to be said that while legislative action and the institutional intervention of Member States have obtained results in political decision -making centers, the same results have not been achieved in the private sector. My contact with major multinational companies in Europe has shown that the situation is sad. There are companies in Europe that employ thousands of employees, often hundreds of thousands of worlds in the world and where women's share of women is less than 2 %! We should also not underestimate women's involvement in the centers of financial decision -making. Of course, in this area, special efforts, which are, of course, may not be legislative, but which can serve as a basis for a change of better practices, and in any case my first contact with these major multinational companies have led to positive results. As you know, the Commission is trying to address this problem within the Commission. It has already been decided that both sex accounts for 40 % in working groups and programs on research and technological development. This has also been tried in your own institution in May 1999, when women's participation in research and technology was emphasized. It is the Commission's responsibility to give a concrete and clear example, and I work with all my Commission colleagues to increase the proportion of women to 40 % in all Commission committees, which will soon be reflected in the Commission reform. Good colleagues, often there are opposition, and this opposition has an advanced protective curtain as a doubt as to whether women's involvement in the exercise of power is needed. No one will ever ask the federal state whether it should represent all the state of the union, and at the European Union level, there would never be a question if a Member State could be left in the committee without representation. So why is it strange and treated if binding legislation is needed to represent the other side of the population. In this case, I want to be absolutely absolute. There must be no reservations for the binding legislation of women in decision -making centers, no reservations.(Applause) Women form half of the population, half of the world's resources. First of all, the exclusion of women from power means a democracy deficit and secondly, the use of human resources. There is a unique challenge ahead of us and time is mature: we have to reconcile economic and political benefits by maintaining democratic principles. I trust that we succeed. The stake here is time. No generation of women must be left aside anymore. We have to rush the situation in every way.(Applause) Mr President, my speech at first, I would like to thank the Minister, the chairmen of the Council for his involvement in this debate and his interesting speech on this topic. I would also like to thank the member of the Commission who was here with us and for his words. Generally, different political groups agree with the fact that women are under -represented in decision -making processes in political, economic and social sectors. Nowadays, no one disagrees that women have to participate in political life, parties and institutions, but it is difficult for us to reach a consensus on how this participation can be increased. The gender equality, which is of the most important thing for women's own lives and, as a result, is equality in working life, and for employment opportunities, which requires equal training and the same work for the same compensation, which is fought hard, but is actually very far away. We are convinced that women's involvement in the decision -making process will benefit society as a whole. Women always bring a new perspective to things, which enriches and complements the overall picture of the best possible solutions for everyday problems, and those who are active in politics are committed to solving these problems.	fi
Now, for this to act, it is fundamental that there remains a public service.This is only how it is possible to guarantee that the network, from removal to distribution, remains full, that it cannot be fragmented or only used in part, according to pairs with the operators of the postal service.But, in the meantime, we know that the Commission, following the directive on common rules for community postal services, commissioned studies, the results of which have not been transmitted to the European Parliament, according to which the impacts of the impact of this directive is unknown, whether at the level of the service offered to citizens or from the point of view of current European postal operators, both at the level of economic aspects.Thus, in our opinion, it is necessary to interrupt the entire process of implementing the said directive, including its calendar.And any modification of the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, always keeping the objective of guaranteeing a quality public service, the maintenance of current public operators and existing workstations.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to fundamentally support this proposal while starting by asking whether what the previous speaker said - namely, that we need on the one hand of a competitive innovative quality service and that on the other hand, this service must be a public service - is not a contradiction in itself.I think we have a differentiated approach here.European policy has released monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air navigation - and the consumer has always been the point of sight.The objective was precisely to offer better service, and it is also the user who must be at the center of the liberalization of La Poste.I think the consumer can decide himself and define what he needs.To do this, he needs no government, any parliament, and he needs no commission either!The post office market follows from afar, and it is, alas, that we have wasted precious time.I think we should also give La Poste the chance to respond to new developments.I refer here to the very good intervention of my colleague Mr. Rübig, who also talked about electronic commerce here.This evolution will arrive very quickly and will bring new requirements for the different companies of our company, requirements to which we must respond very quickly and very flexible.I believe that the liberalized market accelerates this development more than a less liberalized market.In addition, there is also the possibility of representing European policy in a positive way.We must also seize this chance because the citizen always raises the question of the why of Europe.These are the fields where citizen distinguishes in a perceptible way the usefulness of Europe.But I also delighted that the Competition Commissioner, Mr. Monti, is personally present today, because he carries out an excellent policy.And I would like to address here an area where Parliament and the Commission must in my opinion, and this also emerges from this debate, questioning the establishment of a competition limit.We approve the competition as a element of the social market economy - we also do it because we want to make this economic system the best possible.	fr
Member of the Commission, I know very well what are the obligations of the establishment agreements, but I believe that it would be important to emphasize that Europe does not compare to the United States in competition and especially for lack of openness and competition. Something very important is now done now, but that's not enough. Mr President, we have a strange debate on competition policy and state subsidies that are like the left and right hand of the authorities. However, while EMU criteria force Member States to limit their expenditure, companies have so far been awarded a large number of state aid. It is understandable because the Member State, which begins to dismantle state aid, takes a great risk of companies changing, which has a negative impact on employment. At the same time, it is not understandable because poor business and non -liability jobs are not supported by taxpayers' money. In principle, only horizontal arrangements are allowed because they distort little or not at all. Therefore, 6 and 7 of the rapporteur checks are worth supporting. Reviews 1 and 5 refer to market deficiencies because market forces alone do not create an ideal society. Weak -driven people are strong. The operation of the market forces must be used in a selective way to make the responsibility of citizens and businesses as much as possible. If you fail, the state must intervene. The White Book of the Commission on modernization of competition policy is mostly the discussion document. The requirement for decentralization to facilitate the work pressure of the Director of Competition provides compassion, but the way in which the Commission wants to do this causes the legal system to overload. This occurs at the expense of business legal certainty. Do the Commission's work pressure really easier if national courts are obliged to report to the Commission? What does the Council think about this, and is the Commission member ready to reconsider these points? The Mr President, the White Book is not to be accepted or rejected, but its purpose is to arouse reactions, and there is really a success. It is a good foundation for discussion and in that sense it is welcome. I understand the starting points of the authors and I agree with them. I will also start from the fact that you, a Member of the Commission, wants to be appreciated by reputation and the work done by your predecessors and that your officials have the same goal. I cannot imagine the Commission to take initiatives to take thoroughly to dismantle Europeanization or re -nationalize. However, I have my concern and question. First of all, the consistency of the application of politics. In general, I strongly support the diversity of cultures, but not in the case of a competitive culture in the internal market. In the internal market, a consistent competition policy is needed, not just in terms of concept but also in application. However, community regulations and explanatory disclosures are drawn up. The Commission also has the right to intervene and could also provide guidelines to the national competition authorities. However, I wonder if we do not take the risk of being in a slow progressive procession where we first have to take one step back, to take two steps forward. I would like to hear a little more, dug -in, how the Commission guarantees this uniform application in practice, and do you consider to achieve these goals that are sketched in the White Book 100? Secondly, I understand business concern about legal certainty. Now, many things are being brought about in mind. In the future, this tool will be removed. You say in a white book that the Commission gives individual decisions that can act as guidelines, but what are your criteria when you give individual decisions in some cases, but in some cases you do not? Third, I would like to hear if the Commission has examined the consequences of its new approach to business strategy. I am particularly concerned about the fate of small and medium -sized enterprises when they lose some of their legal and financial protection, as is the case with a new vertical group exception on the distribution port.	fi
Unfortunately, as everyone has recognized during military actions in Kosovo, civil sectors, in particular linked to the fields of infrastructure which directly concern populations, and even inhabited areas have been affected during NATO air actions.It is a recognized fact, it happens in all wars and the war of Kosovo is not a clean war, it is not an exemplary war, it is the possible war.I know it was a necessary war.It was the possible war, it was the war necessary to put an end to what was an absolutely unacceptable assault and perfectly condemned by the entire international community.Mr. Deputy, regardless of the reading that we can do a posteriori -it is easy to engage in a posteriori readings, if there had been no actions -I think that given what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, as well as the impunity of what happened there and the extension of this impunity, we can give ourselves to a less catastrophic reading of NATO actionKosovo.Question nº 4 of (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia since the European Union actively encourages the development of social, economic and political relations with Armenia, within the framework of the partnership and cooperation agreement signed on October 12, 1999, what measures does the Council take to persuade the Turkish government to remove the economic blockade of Armenia?The time has come to the Turkish government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia for the Turkish government?Mr. President, I would like to thank the representative of the presidency of the council for his answer.However, I am a little sad that we see this above all on the bilateral level when it is ultimately a triangular relationship.We grant partnership funds and we have a cooperation agreement to help Armenia, and the aid is nevertheless ineffective, because Turkey maintains an economic blockade so that many things cannot achieve Armenians.We negotiate with Turkey for its possible membership and it is in our interest to all that any state wanting to become a member of the EU also has friendly relations with its neighbors.Can you not exert a greater influence on Turkey to facilitate a peaceful development, to make Armenians access the development necessary for the continuation of collaboration?You are absolutely right, madam, to say that we must take advantage of relations with Turkey precisely so that this country can play a constructive role in this situation and, in particular, so that it is part of the solution and that it ceases to be part of the problem.We believe that the fact that Turkey has entered a new phase of relations with the European Union and that it is confronted with the need to provide an answer to the European Union positions in matters of foreign policy and common security represents - it must be said - a test of the will of this country in relation to the priorities of the European Union in its relationship with the outside.	fr
We considered this problem, do you think!We have considered it and scrutinize it with great attention, especially thanks to the concerns you have exposed.Frankly, I do not believe that these fears are ultimately justified.The Commission's proposal gives it a central role in determining the orientations of the competition policy.The reform does not imply any reduction in the work of the Commission but a refocusing of these on the larger files.It will lead to a progressive development of European competition culture - I allow myself to insist on this fact because the expression used by President Randzio -Plat, which I fully share, struck me a lot.The reform will therefore lead to a transplantation, to a rooting, in the field of European competition culture, where today varying plants prospered, which are not uniform, different national cultures in the field of competition.The fifteen national rights will be gradually abandoned to give way to a larger use of Community law which can be applied by a greater number of actors.This is, I would like to emphasize this, a communitarization and not a renationalization of competition law.Application consistency.The risk of an incoherent application of competition rules must be kept in mind, but I believe that it should not be exaggerated.Like many other provisions of the Treaty, articles 81, paragraph 1, and 82 have been applied for decades and national judges and it does not seem to me that it has created big problems.In a regime of legal exception, the maintenance of consistency will first depend on the clarity of material rules.The Commission will strive to refine the legislative framework, both by acts of general scope and by its decision -making practice.Conflict prevention prevention and the White Paper will also have to be established contains information and consultation mechanisms.On this subject, I would like to say two words about the idea, which I find excellent, of Mrs. Riis-Jørgensen and Mr. Huhne, namely the idea of ​​monitoring the application.So this is the idea for monitoring the application.I believe that this idea is judicious and that we will probably adopt it.Although we deeply respect the work carried out by the national competition responsible for competition, among others, it is clear that we will carefully examine the way in which the legislation of the EC will be applied by the national authorities and the courses.This is the reason why the Commission wants to maintain the right to withdraw a case from the hands of a national authority responsible for competition in the event that the application is not correct.It can somewhat relieve your concerns, Ms. Peijs.(En) To respond to the point raised by Mr. Evans concerning the impact on companies, it is important to say that the analysis of costs and yields should be carried out seriously.The objective of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to bring together the comments issued by companies and other sources.We have received excellent observations and contributions in large numbers which offer us the necessary elements in order to carry out an assessment of costs and yields for companies.We will examine all this material carefully before developing a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	fr
You will certainly say yes, but I would like to know from you: do the gentlemen also know what that means in consequence?The next question, Ms. Wallström: When will you start to apply this in legislation, for example in chemical laws, for example in legislation in other areas?The last question: Will we be able to recognize where this was used in the legislation?That is, there will be an extra -dab in every suggestion that says that the precautionary principle has been checked and has you come to this result?Thank you very much, Ms. Roth-Behrendt, for these questions.Of course, the entire commission shares this view.This is a joint message created by us three, David Byrne, Erki Liikania and myself, which was also unanimously adopted in the Commission today.She met with great support from the other commissioners and is the result of a consultation of the various departments within the Commission.So we have worked through this document really well, and I am sure that everyone is able to explain the guidelines and principles that are explained in this document.Yes, I would even say that we this working method on various difficult topics, such as:B. already apply to the question of a new strategy in the field of chemicals.And I am sure that we will also expressly point out if we work with this principle.Especially recently, we applied the precautionary principle in a case that dealt with the ban on phthalates in toys made of soft PVC, and of course we fall back on it in various environmental areas.It was mainly used in the environmental area, but also with questions of human health.So we will try to make very clear how and when it is to be used.President, Ms. Commissioner!In terms of the relationship between science and the recourse to the precautionary principle, the communication that the use of the pension principle is required, especially if science has no evidence.This naturally transmits a high degree of power to science.We can ask ourselves which scientists will deliver this documentation and what they defend.Since it also says that a sufficiently recognized minority of scientists is sufficient to apply the precautionary principle, I ask: What is the definition of a recognized minority?How do you describe this?How do you get a recognized minority?With regard to the political decision, my question is: Who makes this political decision?The Commission?Or the advice?To what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role?What role is the scientific committees intended?What will the role of the food authorities to set up?In conclusion: Will this decision -making process be transparent, publicly made?These are my three questions.Yes, Mr. President, that's right.There were many difficult topics that were not always very clear and clear, but I want to try to answer some of the questions.Who will make the decision, who is the decision -makers?Well, it depends on who the legislators are.This is part of the risk management.	de
This would represent the right kind of international cooperation, not the wrong cooperation that is practiced in free trade areas and with dishonest friends belonging to the OECD. Mr President and Member of the Commission in order to implement a credible fishing policy, the Commission must have the most complete and reliable information about fish stocks and fishing ships as possible. The Commission is dependent on the collection of this information on the Member States. The communal framework for collecting this information brings some structure and improves opportunities for scientific evaluation. However, the question arises whether the Member States in this new arrangement are ready to provide the necessary information by the desired time. The Commission's proposal lacks effective sanctions or incentives to make Member States work more seriously. Can we also trust enough information? How reliable are the prey data, when fish are still illegally imported in large numbers, as David Cox, chairman of British fishermen, recently recognized in Fishing News. So what do you think about the information about the fleet capacity? As a result of the criticism made by the Court of Audit, this Parliament approved the review I submitted to the Cunha report by a large majority in January. This review required an independent review of the fleet capacity information. I would like to hear from the Commission what it has made for this recommendation, which has also been supported by the advisory committee. Then, in the end, sometimes important decisions are primarily based on biologists' statements. Therefore, it is also very important that the accuracy of biological predictions is improved. In this context, I think about the certification of statements. In addition, the Commission must arrange sufficient funding to investigate fish stocks. In addition, the recommendation should state that fishermen's knowledge and experiences are better exploited in the preparation of biological statements. Northern Ireland's fisheries industry has often experienced hard from the Union. There, others have been seen to rob the waters of Northern Ireland while local fishermen have had to keep their boat in the countries and refrain from fishing. Recent decisions on the Irish Sea's cod quota are again a tough blow, which may well prove to be a death strike in the fisheries industry in Northern Ireland. I notice a Commission member smiling, but I speak with the authority of all political parties in Northern Ireland. There are differences between them, but everyone agrees on this. The European Union must admit that when making such drastic decisions, contrary to the fishermen themselves who have been fully pushed as far as abnormal scientific evidence of their own fish stocks, that these men are not listened to can only cause serious problems. The full representatives of these fishermen recently departed from Northern Ireland for a visit to Brussels, where they were threatened to drive out of the meeting as they tried to present their case they had prepared well. This is a scandal because they should be listened to. It should be remembered, and I want it to be remembered today. I was attending a meeting where scientists told us that the Irish Sea would soon be extinct in the Irish Sea, and it was then that there was a particularly significant, even dazzling rise in the breeding of the Irish Sea, so scientists could be wrong. As I said, all Northern Ireland parties in this matter are single-inch, and those responsible for this Regulation on Cod Demonstration should reconsider this decision, as it does not mean the preservation of fish stocks, but the destruction of the fisheries of Northern Ireland, which has an effect on the fisheries of the entire Union. Mr President, our colleagues, the reports by our colleague, are very significant, and it is also very important that we have as much information as possible about the fishing industry of the Member States, especially when the Commission is soon, in 2002, a report on a joint fishing policy review. However, the fact that the up -to -date and delivery of this information is only voluntary and is about very different information and sectors, may distort the final purpose of the Commission's proposal. This happened, as was already stated here in the perennial guidance programs, and it caused great drawbacks to those countries that carried out exactly these programs and provided relevant information to the Commission, compared to other countries that did not implement these programs or not only provided information.	fi
"We will present to the Council, before Lisbon, our proposals on a rapid reaction medium to provide aid whenever required, not in months or years, but in days or weeks. We are creating a Commission Crisis Center as a functional interconnection with the Center for Statement at the Political Unit of the Supreme Representative. In addition, this is for me the most important sector of all, an innovative sector, since we present our proposals on the average reaction, we will soon present proposals related to the non -military basic goals. It is, I repeat, innovation, but it is important to do so for many reasons. Police in Kosovo, policing anywhere else is the most dramatic and obvious example. After all, this is not just the kind of policing we recognize in municipal police officers standing in the corner of the road. When I was young, I was hoping to allow me to go out on Saturday night to see a TV program for a police officer, Dixon of Dock Green. Before I did this job, I was writing an exhibition, and even a very good report, just to answer my honorable friend about policing in parts of my own homeland. I remember discussing municipal police with some Americans, police experts, when I asked ""who in your opinion the ideal policeman"" and I replied I got ""a black grandmother"". But this kind of policing, unfortunately, is not what Kosovo needs. We have Armed Forces, and we all have experience in training municipal police police officers. What really needs in these cases is something between the Armed Forces and the Municipal Police. We need someone who has the ability to identify crimes, but also the increased ability to deal with really difficult public situations. This is exactly what we have to develop in the European Union. In addition, we must realize that this has effect on resources. Consequently, we are again in the rhetoric and reality. Mr Titley now referred to the prevention of conflicts with her broad meaning and asked how much we would be able to contribute from this debate to this debate. One of the things I would advise him to do is listen to Radio 4 in late March the first Reith lecture, where he will hear the Commissioner for Foreign Relationships giving an extremely moving and convincing lecture on the whole thing. However, maybe I could say one or two things this afternoon. I think there is an umbilical cord between the neglect of human rights, the neglect of the Habeas Corpus, the neglect of all the usual rules of good governance, between tyranny and environmental degradation. All this goes together. We are talking about the complexities of our ecosystem, but there is an ecosystem of values ​​and political institutions that are just as important, absolutely vital, if we are going to improve people's lives in countries such as Mozambique, as well as the lives of people closest to us in the Balkans."	el
In March of last year, a member of the Sam Raininte party was assassinated by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal.In September, two members of the party were arrested on the grounds that they were involved in an attack on the arugula against the Prime Minister.Note that it is the only Cambodian party who does not have a military wing.In October, a parliamentarian of the same party was removed by men in uniform and was only released after payment of a ransom.The intimidation scheme is clear.But other things are still going on in Cambodia;Torture of prisoners, involvement of the army and the police in the trafficking of women and children, excessive preventive arrests.All this is on the agenda.Even more serious is the government's refusal to have the leaders of the Khmers Rouge judged by an international court.It is true that the civil war in Cambodia is over and that political tensions are less.However, the way in which the political opposition is treated at present causes us deep concerns and, if this continues, this must have consequences on the relations of the Union with Cambodia.Mr. President, a new doctrine is being trained in international law, according to which no state will no longer be able to deal with its citizens and people living in its territory anyhow and the sovereignty of a state can no longer prevent third parties from intervening in the event of aggravated human rights violations, even in cases where the leaders of a state have been legally or even democratically elected.Living examples of this were the case Pinochet-Ugarte and Kosovo or, less flagrant but within the Union itself, the debates on the formation of the new Austrian government.This development will now be compromised in Cambodia if the former management of the oppressive regime cannot be prosecuted.At the same time, we endanger the fight against impunity.The situation should also remind us of the fact that the ratification of the treaty establishing the international criminal tribunal was shamefully slow.Mr. President, the human rights debate that we held yesterday will have been extremely useful.I am delighted that we have once again had the opportunity to examine a certain number of regions of the world Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights constitutes a particularly great challenge.First of all, with regard to Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these resolution projects with regard to general policy with regard to Kosovo, the continuation of ethnic violence and prisoners in Serbian prisons.In Kosovo, as well as in the region, our efforts are aimed at short and medium -term recovery and long -term stabilization.We support in particular the development of a free, democratic and multi -hethnic society.Our assistance programs in the areas of democratization and human rights should continue to establish confidence in general and try to establish confidence between different communities in particular.	fr
B5-0173/2000 of the deputies Papayannakis and Sjöstedt, on behalf of the Gue/NGL, B5-0179/2000 of Schroedter deputies and others, in the name of the green group/ALE on the environmental disaster in the waters of the Danube.Mr. President, this week, we discussed the framework directive on water and the disaster in Romania shows us once again how seriously we have to take the protection of water.This disaster has raised a certain number of important questions that concern us as a European.We are delighted with the promise that rivers will be cleaned with the help of the EU.The strengthening of environmental consciousness, both in Romania and, more generally, in central and eastern Europe, is at least as important.We salute the speed of the visit of Commissioner Wallström on the spot because it can contribute to this awareness.In the end, it is a candidate state and this disaster adds to the already existing concern to know if all the candidate states will in time satisfy the EU environmental rules.The polluter must pay.I wonder if the European Union can pass on this kind of costs on environmental cowboys that work in what is called wild by using the weakness of environmental legislation on site.I would be favorable.Mr. President, the Commissioner, the ecological disasters follow each other and, unfortunately, are alike.There is enough to be dismayed, once again, by this serious pollution which today defiles the fourth wetland in Europe in order of importance.The Danube delta is in danger.As in Spain, in April 1998, as in Brittany and Vendée since last December, this time again, an exceptional natural site which is seriously threatened.In its resolutions, the European Parliament continues to draw attention to the dangers of this type that threaten our environment, upset our ecosystem and weaken, once again, the populations.This new catastrophe poses the problem of integration of the community acquired in environmental matters for candidate countries.The authorities of these states must overcome, still very fragile from an environmental point of view, are numerous.First, they should be able to prevent this type of spill more by developing the most critical industrial sites;Then, they should be able to have sufficient technical means to stop such pollution and reduce its magnitude;Finally, they should be able to implement programs to restore the most affected and sensitive sites.Today, the banks and waters of more than four rivers travel over four states are polluted.This is why the European Union must concentrate its efforts and pressures on the imperative need for all candidate countries, to align themselves on community environmental protection standards.But beyond that, it is the technologies and the means put in to prevent, and to meet this type of disasters quickly and effectively, which are involved.	fr
The work document drawn up by the court contains alarming information. Therefore, this proposal for the reform, which is presented by Vice President Marinho, is a very positive thing. It is a pattern proposal, but you also have to be pleased with the patching, as at the moment and Marinho emphasized this from the inter -governmental conference for a major system reform. We need to find solutions that can be used to practice justice faster and more efficiently. I would like to present two ideas in my speech, which are included in the actual report, as Parliament has a duty to prepare concise reports and not to deal with it too deeply. These are Vice -President Marinho's thoughts, and I believe I can say that the entire jurisdiction committee supports them. The first of these is that the judges of the first court court should give them more tools to give them one more lawyer. Another idea is that the first court translation department would be distinguished from the Court's translation department. Currently, the first court must wait for a very long time to reverse its decisions. We live in a community whose agreement includes the principle of cultural and linguistic diversity, and we may not think that we are eliminating something as important as the ability of everyone to read the judgment in their own language. As we talk about the inter -governmental conference, let us focus on only two things. The first relates to Parliament. In my opinion, it is worth emphasizing that we want more opportunities to participate not only in matters concerning the Court of Justice, but also in appointing judges. Above all, we also want to increase the powers of the Court of Justice, as well as its ability to perform its obligations, that is, the means of operating. We want its powers to be increased, in particular with regard to the Division IV of the European Community and the Department of the European Convention on the European Union, while at the same time reviewing some of the possible alternatives, some clear restrictions on protection in these very important areas for our citizens. Again, I refer to the statements we have heard in recent days. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the presenter and have a positive attitude towards the content of this report. It made me think about two problems that came up recently in my constituency. Both are related to cases that are still pending in the courts of the Communities. The first problem is related to a large suspension bridge and whether or not VAT should be charged for bridge fees. The decision could have a huge impact on our local decisions. Another problem is about a retired lady in 13 weeks, waiting for a decision in despair to have a major impact on the financial situation of her old age. Here are only two examples of real problems caused by the slowness of the European legal system. The slowness of the legal system can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy. This does not mean that all of our national legal systems are perfect, but they may be too often awaiting a preliminary ruling of the Community Court. Based on the statistics, the time for a preliminary ruling is concerned has increased. This should not be considered as a criticism of the court or its personnel, but rather in the European Union growing against the structure and shortage of courts. The proposals in this report are very positive as a temporary remedy, but the community is a legal structure and courts are essential for its proper functioning. HVK must discuss the thorough reform and restructuring of the court system before the expansion. Otherwise, as an election -elected representative, we will receive more and more complaints from citizens that the legal system does not work quickly and effectively. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, Good Colleagues, I also thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully agree with his conclusions, where he, in particular, proposes to raise the number of lawyers of the court of the first court and issue his own translation department to the first court court. I really find this necessary because we heard when the committee on the legal committee visited Luxembourg that, of course, the Court of Communities has a completely automatically automatically, so -called God's command, priority to the common translation service in relation to the first court and therefore often cannot be handled in the first court.	fi
However, it must be emphasized that the instructions that we speak of which we are talking about apply to Structural Funds, which, of course, are the most important rural environment for targets 1 and 2. Now that it is about this balance of the rural environment, we must also not forget the new rural development policy, which is funded by the EMOTR Support Department and is responsible for promoting the reform of the Union's agriculture and supporting the multi -functionality of agriculture. At this point, I would just like to say that I hope to be involved in the design of Target 2 in the design of Rural Areas, in the same way as the EMOTR Guidance Department participates in target 1 areas. In any case, in this case, I have understood the vigilance you have shown in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. Before I quit, I would like to say to Savarry that tomorrow we will have a special discussion on the consequences of the storms of France, Austria and Germany in recent weeks, and at the same time we talk to my colleague de Palacio about what to learn about the oil boards caused by the disaster. If it suits you, a good member of the Parliament, I will only express my own thoughts, most of which I agree with your recommendations on what we can do to combat these oil boards with goal 2. I will remind you that tomorrow the Commission will accept maps of the target 2 areas of France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg. Thus, we have a way to take action in most of the storm areas. Otherwise, for this reason, I am going to the day afterwards to a visit to two French department, where these storms caused great damage. Finally, I would like to thank you, the good rapporteur, your self and your committee for the quality work done and thank you, the Mr President, for the understanding you have shown, and I would like to say that despite a few of the differences in the task of the preparation guidelines, we have talked about them, and I have tried to clarify my own point of view. Instructions that are provided to help Member States as they draw up their own plans. This can only confirm the concept based on some good practices learned from the experiences of the programming period 1994999. It seems to me, a good member Hatzidakis that at the beginning of the good cooperation between such an institution, at the beginning of the programming period 2000-2006, we predict that good and well-established practical cooperation will continue as we respect the procedural rules that are very high in our institutions. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered tomorrow at 12 noon. The social and economic situation and development of the European Union regions on the agenda is the next Berendi Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee report (A5-0107/1999) of the sixth seasonal report on the social and economic situation and development of the European Union (99) 0066-C5-0120/99-1999/2123 (COS)). Mr President, a Member of the Commission, a good colleague, this sixth seasonal report on the social and economic situation of the European Union regions means a kind of turning point in analyzing regional information and illuminates the development that has been produced in this area after the fifth seasonal report. However, I understand that it is about the actual convergence achieved in the average development of the European regions, gives a slightly wrong picture of the real situation, and unfortunately, this kind of message is often highlighted in the press and in certain speeches. The Commission's report puts this statement largely on the right frameworks, as it specifically covers the social and economic situation of some areas of the Union of particular importance to me: I want to talk about the French seaweed department and usually the remote areas. In this sense, I am delighted that the Committee on Regional Policy has approved one of my amendments and urged the Commission to reserve one chapter in its following report on cohesion, especially for the most outrageous areas, and more specifically to analyze the effects that have been accepted in the near future.	fi
"These inspections can usually take place on the street, in ports or at other parking spaces or, as far as the public service vehicles are concerned, in the facilities of the owners.In fact, there are already several states that carry out controls of this kind, the so -called ""controls on the roadside"", as they are intended in the directive, that is, to a certain extent unexpected.Perhaps this is really the best way to achieve effective control of the condition of the vehicles that use our road network.I would like to say that the commission of the concern of parliament is aware that this proposal can lead to discrimination against private transport companies or from commercial vehicles from certain countries or even from certain vehicle brands and that its rapporteur intends with the main recommendation that the penalties imposed by the Member States are harmonized as a prerequisite for the application of this guideline.However, we share this concern, but it is of the opinion that change application 2 is too radical, and in this sense we would support amendment 3, which takes up the spirit of what we all strive for and at the same time offers sufficient flexibility.We also accept change application 1, and I would like to respond to what Mr. Bouwman said.We are very concerned about the fact that vehicles are on the streets of the Union whose drivers are citizens from third countries, in particular from accession countries, and which do not have employment contracts in accordance with the municipality's provisions or a state, but simply to the standards of these third -country candidates, or sometimes not even that, because there are no corresponding controls in these third countries.In a letter to all Minister of Transport of the Fifteen States of the Union, I have opposed a debate on this question and also to request a report about what experiences you have gained in your countries with such cases and what positive suggestions you can do in order to solve this problem that is very worried and the negative effect on traffic safety, and on what it has to be important to us, and on a fair competition, and a fair competition, andwhich we can also attach importance to the commission.In this sense, I hope that we can treat these questions in the next Council ""Transport"" at the end of this month, as well as all questions, as Mr. Watts said, in relation to traffic safety in general, since the Portuguese government describes it as one of the key issues in its presidency.Based on the great progress achieved in recent years, I believe that there is still a lot to do, because 42,000 - 43,000 European citizens who are killed on the streets are too high.Even greater efforts have to be made.But I would like to say about the question of drivers from third countries that we hopefully have an answer until the end of the month, and in any case we will treat them in the council.And in connection with an inquiry or an initiative, I will be able to give an answer here in parliament, either during the plenary session or in the committee.Otherwise, I will definitely hope that in the foreseeable future we can make a concrete proposal that enables the effective and real fight against such misuse."	de
We will carefully check every commissioner, so I want to warn the other commissioners. Thank you very much for the answer, which I interpret as affirmative, that is, what is needed is an action plan that will lead more women to participate in specific environmental areas. Let me also say that the Beijing Declaration highlights the importance of having the institutional possibility of including equality parameter in each environmental planning. Environmental institutions often lack the knowledge and processes of integrating this parameter into their daily work. Of course, I would like to know if the Commissioner is willing to integrate the principle of equality into environmental policy and environmental programs because this is important. I believe that in order to inspire all politics from this perception it is particularly important that the directors of the higher levels have this fundamental knowledge. Commission.(Sv) I think mainstreaming should of course characterize anything we do. In the plan we process in my general address, equality issues play a very important role. I am also willing to organize seminars on managerial duties or other issues, with the aim of encouraging women to assume additional duties to the Commission. I believe that in order to be able to give everyone motivation it is very important to send this message to all levels, from top to bottom - or from bottom to top, if you prefer. I think that women often dominate the general environmental work. The point is to reproduce this phenomenon in order to give women the opportunity to undertake managerial duties or to rise hierarchically in the context of the environmental project. I argue that this is reflected in the measures we have, but it can certainly become better. I have some programming and monitoring experience and I hope it is useful. Question No.43 by K. (H -0045/00): Subject: The Boyne River and the Drogoreda Port Company The Boyne River has been designated as a Special Protection Zone (SPA), in the context of the Wild Birds Directive, and is also considered to be designated as a special protection zone.international importance. However, the Ministry of the Navy, the Louth Council and Drogoreda have allowed the construction of a new port in the SPA and even the destruction of a stegrennan muddy who was recently added to the SPA list at the Commission's persistent request. In addition, a large warehouse has been built, for which it is difficult to ensure access to the building permit while the construction of other Drogoreda infrastructure projects is planned. How could the Commission ensure that such an infrastructure project, which is funded through structural funds, does not conflict with the needs of the nature of the area? Does the Commission intend to completely discontinue the funding of work until the region's development plans are reviewed? The Commission is aware of the construction of the port, but knows nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure to which the Member is mentioned.	el
I should suggest, Mrs. President, that Parliament first waits for whether the party of Mr. Haider will influence the policy of that country.Then and only then could they judge whether human rights are affected.This parliament could consider suitable measures to counter this situation, and then, and only then, could it consider to interfere in the constitutional matters of a country of the European Union.Mrs. President, as a member of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns of some colleagues about democratic development in Austria.You may be surprised about my reaction if I find that the special sensitivity to Austria in questioning human rights, the awareness of responsibility towards my own past and the stability of democracy meets my personal understanding.Austria has the often dubious image, which prevails abroad or unjustifiably, is responsible for itself.The years of refusal to admit our governments, our complicity to the horror of World War II, and the refusal of the governments of just reparation towards the Jewish victims and the forced labor have contributed significantly to this negative image.Now this FPÖ has entered a government coalition with the ÖVP due to an election order dated October 3, 1999, when the old government was elected.This is the right of the citizens of a state because it is the basic principle of a democracy.After the talks between the SPÖ and the ÖVP, the socialists tried to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for support.We were offered three ministerial posts - you only need to read this in the newspapers -, of all people, of all people who is denounced here as a fascist!When we suddenly rejected this offer, a passionate agitation and propaganda began, which we still have not understood.The FPÖ is a party established in the political landscape of Austria.She puts the governor in one of the nine federal states and is involved in all other governments.Why, so many Austrians are wondering today, their democratic decision is suddenly interpreted as an expression of the fascist attitude, why did the agitation only began when the freedoms rejected the support of a minority government of the SPÖ?Here there is a preliminary conviction that - without responding to our program - reduces the cruelest epoch in European history into a political spectacle.It increases my disgust when some of our opponents take advantage of the million -dollar deaths in the gas chambers of the concentration camp for cheap propaganda, such as the Italian MP Bertinotti, who accused Herr Haider on Italy yesterday that he would deny the Holocaust.Ashamed, Mr. Colleague!Even if you assume all political arguments, you don't have the right to use the murdered for your cheap propaganda.You don't become an anti -fascist here if you denounce a democratically elected politician as a Nazi!On the contrary, they mock the true victims of National Socialism and trivialize the fascist dictatorships.They act because of their own prejudices, forego every political discussion and act exactly in the style they pretend.The attack against the new government of Austria, the attempt to influence political influence in a member country is an insult to the Austrian population.	de
We cannot afford to delay.An ambitious objective for the schedule is essential.I do not consider this to be too bold, if we assume that in 2020 there will be no more introductions to water and that we will strive for zero level in relation to contamination and the emission toxic substances.It is about doing what is technically possible, of course not more, but we have to be sufficiently ambitious.I would like to go into a problem that has already been addressed.In my opinion, the environmental committee has made the question of redistribution of water too tight.This is not just a problem in Spain, it is also due in the Nordic countries.I sincerely hope that national solutions will be trusted here, provided that they are better from an environmental and economic policy perspective than the solutions provided for in the directive.President, Ms. Commissioner!I would like to congratulate Ms. Lienemann on an excellent work.Water and air surround us everywhere.We share them with all the people on earth.Water is a prerequisite for human life that is more and more popular.Ms. Schleicher indicated this morning that clean water was an unrealistic demand.Nothing could be more incorrect!It is unrealistic to gradually worsen the water quality and thus the prerequisites for life.This is particularly unrealistic for agriculture, which is most dependent on a clean nature and clean natural riches.That is why I would like to appeal to the MPs of this parliament, to see that a clean environment is the greatest realism in the long term.Mr. President, we - and that also applies to me personally - support Ms. Lienemann's report as well as the goals set there and the guideline for debate.Nevertheless, we should take a closer look at some aspects.For example, the redirection of rivers and the build -up of water through lakes are major problems, alleged development projects, which in reality actually cause considerable dangers for the groundwater, the groundwater level and the surface waters.Regardless of whether we will ultimately agree on who can decide such diversions, the regulations must apply equally to everyone and are extremely strictly applied.In my opinion, the jumping point, Ms. Commissioner, is the planning of the restoration of the groundwater level and the natural river runs as well as the natural state of the lakes, which can be achieved within the time frame of ten years.Such projects should certainly be granted so that they can be funded financially, because ultimately such a restoration could prove to be a very excellent development policy measure.Mr. President, basically this is a good measure.It specifies realistic norms on which the principles of subsidiarity and the management of the water catchment areas are based.It pursues the right goal, which consists in the guarantee of good water quality for humans and animals, for the environment and economic purposes.The avoidance of water pollution and the deterioration in water quality, as well as the ability of the management at times of dryness and flooding, are desirable goals.	de
She was placed in the hands of a single commission member, Mr. Antonio Vitorino, and we are also happy about it.He has also been transferred to the draft of an indicator that enables the progress to be determined, which in this area at the community level, but also - and that seems important to me - were really achieved at the level of the Member States.We are happy and congratulate the advice on these decisions, although Amsterdam's contract included a disappointment for this parliament: the five -year -old postponement with regard to the perception of our role, our possibility of active participation, the democratic control of this space of law, freedom and security as well as the role of the Court of Justice, which this must play in it.However, if we leave the field of great explanations and consider the truly and realized resolutions when examining the progress in 1999, how to meet this parliament through the mandate of the contract, the panorama becomes pretty dark, Mr. President.It is as if the council has more than one face and two hands, and what one signs and explains the other.Despite all the obligations received at the highest level, the Council did not have to take the decisions that he had intended to grasp himself.The programs are becoming increasingly numerous and overlap, and there is no way to check the degree of implementation and effectiveness, or at least it is not possible for this parliament.We have put a number of inquiries to the Council, and I know that the Portuguese presidency is willing to answer each one.We hope that this presidency will initiate a change in the hiring of the council to this parliament.I said there was no relation between the decisions made by the Council and the really realized policies.There are doubts in my faction and in this plenary, for example on a topic that should be good news: the agency of Schengen.Schengen has been integrated into the acquis - we said before, but this was done in a very little transparent frame.No information, no request was received during this process in the European Parliament, neither about the association of the United Kingdom nor about the inclusion of Greece and nor about negotiations with Norway or Iceland.The same is to be said in relation to immigration policy.We drove ourselves to the development of mountains of reports, but we do not know what happened to these initiatives, they have disappeared.We hope that 2000 will be the year of realizations, as was the year of expectations in 1999.And we hope that the Council is willing to accommodate the control of this high house.The Council has decided that the judicial and domestic policy should be part of the House of the Union.The Council can act according to its decisions or further shaken off the inclusion of the other institutions into this vital project.When he chooses the second way, he must know that this bird risks and weakens the basics on which the space of freedom, security and law is based.	de
It will not be a coincidence, as I repeat, in my opinion we have the same ambition for this negotiation and we feel that it is for the European Union at the time of truth. Finally, I would like, Mr President, to quickly make three additional observations. First, to congratulate and thank President Napolitano and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely important and original initiative taken yesterday, to gather the special representatives of the national parliaments, the Committee of Constitutional Affairs and the Committee for a first. This dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and our own is extremely important. After all, I have already stated that I would also attend all national parliaments personally. Tomorrow I'll be in London. Within fifteen days I will be in Berlin. In three weeks, I will be in Paris and continue, the capital of the capital, from my position, to participate in this dialogue. I find it extremely positive that you took this initiative and would like to thank you for it. A second conversation to thank the Portuguese Presidency and in particular Mr. Seixas de Costa for the will. After all, what he said earlier translates this will very well and this concern that coincides with his own: The Portuguese Presidency cannot be a transitional presidency. This will start the negotiation. We are well aware that it will not be able to be completed during these six months and that the baton will then pass to the French Presidency, hoping to be completed before the end of 2000. And not only to be completed but to succeed, which is not exactly the same thing. Completing a negotiation is not the same thing with its success. The baton will pass, but the conditions under which this baton will pass through you, Mr President, and the Portuguese Presidency, will be extremely important, as is the nature of this baton. What is of particular importance is the whole work that will be done together and especially with your own push during these few months. We have great confidence and a great deal of indulgence on how the Portuguese Presidency, the presidency of a small state will perform its duty. The fact that this is a small country does not mean that we cannot and should not have great ambitions. Having heard Prime Minister Guterrez, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and you, I have confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and the extremely vulgar way in which he will carry out this negotiation. In these few months it may be based on the cooperation of the Commission. Finally, I repeat that we need to make a great effort to popularize the issues of this negotiation. These are difficult issues. These are political and institutional engineering issues that are not always easy to explain. One more reason why European MPs, Ministers, Commissioners will have to spend some time to explain to the citizens to participate in the public dialogue.	el
"It appeals to the Member States to assume all their responsibilities by applying as soon as possible of control measures which, in combination with a sanctions system that will express the principle of ""the polluting pays / the pollutants cleanses"", will allow it to be prevented from resulting in disasters. Recommendation for the second reading (A5-0040/2000) (Rapporteur: Mr. Piecyk) FR) The European Parliament today ruled on the proposal of a directive on road technical control of heavy vehicles. It is indeed necessary to improve the level of security and to limit the impacts of these vehicles on the environment, whose traffic is constantly increasing. Establishing mandatory unplanned road controls in order to control their maintenance level throughout the year is a good idea, as long as it is effectively applied. This Directive proposal will greatly complement the efforts taken in cities, mainly thanks to urban travel plans, and especially in the Rouen urban area, which is crossed by 5,000 heavy vehicles daily. It is also an urgent need to consider the use of alternative ways of transporting goods (internal navigation, rail network, ...) and developing clean technology. For these reasons, dear colleagues, I have today supported the proposal of a directive on the road technical inspection of heavy voyages.(The meeting discontinued at 12.35 continues at 15.00) EU fundamental rights map. The agenda provides the discussion of the report (A5-0064/2000) of Mr. Duff and VoggenHuber, on behalf of the Committee of Constitutional Affairs, on the drawing of a map of the fundamental rights of the European Union., Author of the Opinion of the Committee on Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs.(IT) Madam President is finally coming to the European Parliament to vote for a long -standing report on the drawing of the European Union's fundamental rights map, and I hope that the patient's patient work will be supported by supporting the body. So I hope that the harmful amendments of those who believe that the preparation of a map of fundamental rights is essentially affecting democracy. However, these are rights that already exist largely in the Union, scattered in the circumstances, in the European Convention on Human Rights, the Common Constitutional Traditions of the Member States and the international acts that have been subscribed by all. Why is there a fear of a map of fundamental rights, which is not only the official guarantee and cohesion of these individual inviolable rights without which democracy is turned only into a kingdom of the power of numbers and into a possible abuse of existing powers? The European Union is a peaceful and solidarity of coexistence of various peoples and cultures thanks to its tradition of respect for individual rights. The map will include a set of common principles that determine Europe's identity in the world, an identity that is not based on blood ties, national relations or territorial possessions rather than common values. In thorough recognition of applicable and common rights, those fundamental social rights should be included in their nature from other rights: rights relating to the freedom of trade union, basic rights in life and safety in workplaces, rights in education, and rights to education,"	el
We took fifteen years for the economic and monetary union.We can take fifteen years for defense and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear.I also think that you should not undervalue, this is a question that I ask you, the stranglehold and the strength of the lobbies of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs.We know the strength they have acquired during these forty years of community construction.Today, they would have everything to lose a communitarization of foreign policy, and I think they work in this sense.Finally, on the question of Kosovo - Mr. Cohn -Bendit was right to insist on this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raises the question of the final status of this territory.Without this status, there will be only instability, murders, provocations on the part of Belgrade, and the European Union should be said on that urgently.Finally, I thank Mr. Poettering because I believe that the initiatives of Belgium, as they say in a little clear language, are starting to do well.I think that many Member States, among the fourteen other Member States, would have many reasons not to collaborate in the European Union meetings in matters of justice, for example.Four years from the arrest of Mr. Dutroux and others, we still have no trials, we still do not know what is happening.In terms of tourism too, many would be, among these fourteen member states, those which could question the opportunity to discourage the holidays of parents with young children in Belgium, for example.So, it is time, and I invite Mr. Solana and Mr. Patten, to share with the colleague, Mr. Michel, that perhaps, he does a little too much and that ultimately it risks, which I hope, to turn against him.Mr. President, I would first like to wish a very good March 1 to Mr. Solana, when a whole series of structures relating to European security and defense policy have been started.But I wonder to tell the truth, what he thinks.In the documents, there is a question of good collaboration with the high representative.You even said earlier that you discussed it during lunch;It would still be the height that you did not discuss it and that there is no good collaboration between the new structures and you!But don't you suffer from not chairing these structures yourself and not being at the center?I would like - like more than one within the Parliament, in my opinion - that you are the engine of these structures and that you do not risk being dismissed in any way.In recent months, especially during discussions with the members of the NATO assembly, the High representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have endeavored to delimit the defense policy of the European Union and that of NATO.	fr
Do you think the Commission can stop the approval of the plans, or is it just about paying individual project funds? It did not become completely clear. You allow me to say a couple of three things. First of all, I think community law needs to be considered as a whole. Community law stipulates that if a Member State does not enforce the legislation or incorrectly enforce it, the State is prosecuted. You have to do it! You should not, by failing to pay the budget, try to achieve what you cannot achieve by charges and proper litigation through the back door. I don't think this is completely right. If you say that Member States act contrary to community law and violate community law, blame these Member States! First of all, it is inappropriate that you do not dare to do it, but to secretly try to prevent the budget from paying the budget so that you can force Member States to act indirectly, and secondly, I do not think it does much courage! Secondly, the Member of the Commission, the Structural Fund's funds are certainly not granted to harm nature. They are granted in order to create new jobs and develop areas. As a result, we cannot achieve another goal of preventing or stopping the original objective, which is to help the inferior areas. Besides, it cannot be that one of the members of the Commission is a top member of the Commission and tells another member of the Commission what he or she can do. None of us wants nothing to do about nature conservation. However, the Mr President, the Member of the Commission, does not happen that the areas are suffering because Member States may not do something! It also needs to be taken very carefully in this context! Mr President, now that my colleagues have confirmed the need for a resolution in their speeches, allow me to express two cases of Galicia in my own speech, which can, however, happen in other European countries. Virtually in the center of Ponte Vera and in a particularly good location by the sea is a large complex of the chemical industry, which is formed by ENCE and Elnosa, producing pulp and chlorine and polluting water and air. It does this with the consent of Galician and Spanish decision -makers as the population is constantly protested. In Vila Garcia de Arous, a meadow funded by the European Regional Development Fund has been built with 80,000 cubic meters of hydrocarbon tanks, which are endangered by the existence, either due to conventional handling or carrier accidents. Mr President, in my opinion, the correct and integrated implementation of community environmental legislation is perhaps the biggest challenge that Member States are now facing. Unfortunately, however, environmental policy requirements are not respected and are not taken into account as required when programs and plans are drawn up and approved in Member States. The problem is even greater because, in addition to the violation of environmental legislation approved by the Community and with the funding of the Community, projects and programs implemented in private and national funding are circulated by environmental legislation. This is what I want to draw your attention: in paragraphs B and (8) of the resolution, where this is taken into account. After all, it is absurd that when the Member States implement the environmental legislation of the Community, it does not include all plans, regardless of whether they require funding from the community or elsewhere. Therefore, countries that violate environmental legislation must clearly understand the message that the Commission, which has been entrusted with the Community's primary and secondary right, ensures that projects under construction do not destroy the environment. Cannot be continued to violate the essential environmental regulations. In the end, what is happening in Member States also has to be said because good politics requires openness, courage and truthfulness. And the truth is that the implementation of the Natura 2000 program directives is deficient in my own country and in other Member States.	fi
Because the legality of these functions is not generally monitored, the risks are even more clearer. In order to reduce the risks of investors, the Socialist Group has submitted reviews that propose both quantitative and qualitative protective statements. By accepting these reviews, Parliament allows you to resort to OTC derivatives while limiting the risks of private investors. Mr President, nowadays there is a lot of talk about the principle of good administration. This principle should not only control the public sector, but also the private sector, and especially the financial companies. Mr President, when we create a framework for mutual funds and other collaborative companies, our goal is to ensure that our saver is getting the best possible return on their savings and that is why I want to talk about derivatives today. I strongly believe that using leadership carefully funds can guarantee a safer and better return. Property managers usually use derivatives, despite their assumed risk. For example, a derivative agreement, which is paid a significant amount, if, even if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 share index calculates, it means that the investor will have to pay more if the Nasdaq or CAC 40s will increase. Is this speculation? Not at all. Imagine that for a few months you have put together a portfolio of companies you trust: they have good management and good views and are good investments. Then you will start to worry that the entire stock market may collapse, as happened in 1987. One option is that you sell all your shares and change them into money, but it would mean throwing the effort you saw in favor of victory. You would also have to pay all the brokerage costs related to the sale of your shares and returning them after the collapse. The solution is to invest in a derivative that produces if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 decreases. If you had a customer-specific derivative or OTC leadership that would be cheaper and might protect your portfolio from a relative invoice for the index, you would still have your portfolio and shares, but would have protected yourself from collapse risks. In return, you might have given up some of the most popular market stocks. In this case, which is probably the most common way of utilizing derivatives, you will not only reduce your potential return but also your risk. A well -managed fund is hoped for such development. History shows that investors benefit from market release and subtle regulation. Hard measures on how and to what destinations the private sector asset managers should invest only reduces the return on savers. Pension funds, which are also required to restrict their investment rules, also generated 5.2 % each year in 1984199, which was just over half of the annual return on free funds of free funds. These are, of course, returns that have reduced all losses. Do not confuse genuine benefits of investors with popular fear of a new, innovative and liberal approach that is useful. It is about this that we should be here today. Mr President, the purpose of the report presented today, is to complete the free movement of securities investments in Europe, including their most advanced forms. We do not oppose the principle of this industry. However, in our opinion, and unlike Christopher Huhne's opinion, the Manner, who has not been able to properly monitor his tanker, cannot release too much industry that can cause the same type of crisis in a certain period. Thus, we vote carefully about any reviews that limit the resort to too much derivatives, and vote on checks that limit the over -concentration of the funds on the same financial group. However, we have to say right away that we vote against the whole text. Moreover, we will vote in the future against all proposals for the release of financial markets and urge all other political groups to do the same until the income tax on securities investments is finally harmonized. Certain countries, among which the United Kingdom have been brake for years, have been brake on this harmonization, and thus their funding sites have become tax havens.	fi
You have the good, charming idea that the result and yardstick for your policy and for your five -year program would be the election result or participation in the next European elections.When I imagine that I do not see your work program to my voters, which I see weekly and to whom I have to explain this weekly - not in the high ranks of important politics, but on the street - then I ask what should I say then?Mr. Prodi, what should I say what is new about it?Nothing is new to your work program.They needed 12 pages for five years, they needed 18 pages for a year of work program.Does that make me hopeful for the year 2000?No, that doesn't make me!In your 2000 work program you say something very clever.You say that environmental interests have to be integrated into all other policy areas.Did you do that, Mr. Prodi, and have you read your work program of the year?You didn't do it!You have not integrated environmental policy into the expansion, although it will be one of the core problems when it comes to expansion.You have also not integrated them into economic policy, competition or internal market.You have not done that anywhere.They put together individual set pieces, but they have not formed any overall structure.If you said in your speech beforehand, a disaster like that of the Danube must be a reason for a disaster program - no, Mr. Prodi, we have to finally start implementing legislation and also ensuring the control of the legislation.In your five -year program, you write that the people of the European Union rightly expect better food standards and better food legislation.Mr. Prodi, you don't know what you are talking about!The legislation of the European Union for food is the most ambitious in the world!What is Hapert and what is missing is the implementation in member countries and control.Finally take your task seriously to pull the Member States on the ears as President of the Commission and to force their tasks and their duty!They should not always only maintain hobbies, but do their daily normal work.We expect you to do this in the next five years!President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen!As the chairman of the fishing committee of this parliament, Mr. Prodi does not make things easy for me.I see myself forced to reprimand the lack of fishing in the program that you have presented to us.The next five years of the Prodi Commission - they ceremoniously announce it in the first of their conclusions - will be shaped by major changes.I hope that this change announced by you, according to your pitiful and absolute silence in your program, does not exist in an even greater exclusion of fishing.Not a single line, not a single word about fishing or the GFP.I do not ask you to find any details or precise information, but I think a mention would be necessary.How can you forget a common - I emphasize common - politics of such economic, social and regional effects - therefore with consequences for the economic and social cohesion of Europe - completely forgotten?	de
We should also be humility to admit that if we want to have a strategic debate that does not only involve the presentation and observations of the Commission's chairman but also a five -year program, the mechanisms should be ready earlier than a week before the discussion in Parliament, so that we can talk about our wishes and convey them to the Commission. We would like us to learn one of the basics. When the Parliament and the European Commission in the future have significant discussions, at least one full month earlier, we should find out what we expect from them. First, things have to be clarified between all groups of Parliament and then between Parliament and the Commission. At the last minute, we should not be unfortunate that an institution causes unnecessary distortion in the relationship between the institutions. After reading some recent magazine articles on Friday, I believe that the Commission and its chairman showed commendable self -control in their public statements. I really appreciate it. I hope that we can learn from this lesson and we will no longer have to do this in vain, which I believe was due to false expectations and not so much the fraudulence of either institution. It should no longer be in vain. Thanks, Member Cox! I understand what you mean. We have marked it in memory. The Mr President, with regard to the Protocol on the Protocol on the order of processing, we agreed yesterday that Bourlanges' report would be included in today's agenda. However, the consideration of the report was canceled in the budget committee last night, without discussing or voted. Therefore, it must be removed from today's agenda. Member Wynn, it's logical. The report is thus removed from the agenda. Mr President, I refer to the Member of the Parliament to yesterday's remarks on health and safety in this building and assume he spoke of the sewers because there is a terrible sewer on the fifth floor of the tower building. This must be clarified because the smell clearly suggests that something is badly wrong. I don't want to prolong indefinitely about this building, but this problem is serious. Member Ahern, we have marked the matter. I would ask you to turn in this special case, which is about ventilation of one particular layer, for the Quppors, because this is really their competence. However, we also forward this to Parliament officers. Many thanks!(Protocol was approved.) Community Renewal of Competition Policy on the Agenda is the following joint debate on the following reports: The Commission of the Commission of the Commission of the EC Treaty 85 and 86 of the EC Constitutional Treaty (A5-0069/1999)- 1999/2108 (Cos));Rapkay's report on the Finance and Monetary Committee (A5-0078/1999) about XXVIII on Competition Policy Report (1998) (SEK (1999) 743-C5-0121/1999-1999/2124 (COS);seventh overview of the European Union's Factory Industry and Certain Area 148- C5-0107/1999- 1999/2110);Decision No 2496/96/EHT (Code of Steel Support) in 1998 (KOM (1999) 94/1999 - 1999/2107). The very controversial reform project of the cartel rights, namely the report of von Wogau, is much more controversial than the vote of the Economic and Monetary Committee may have suggested. I definitely want to say that in this concrete case I consider personally the Commission's proposal and that it still has to be revealed whether the concept of reform is really justified in terms of the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Book, or whether the concept would be in this case rather the recession. However, today we are also talking about the report on support and the general report on competition policy (1998), when my share in this joint debate concerns the latter field.	fi
"We must give a satisfactory answer.The case of Flora Brovina is never just one case.We are very mentioning it in the draft resolution but there are hundreds, thousands of Flora Brovina.I ask the commission and the council absent to finally do something for these political prisoners.The fact that they are incarcerated in Serbia contributes to the foundations of disorder and violence in Kosova.Mr. President, in his paragraph 10, the project of common resolution which is presented to us strongly enjoins the Council and the Member States of the European Union to redouble their efforts in order to make available to the United Nations police forces the staff and the necessary means.This request is in full agreement with the opinion of the high representative of the United Nations in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner.To fulfill his mission of restoring and maintaining public order in Kosovo, he believes that he needs at least 6,000 foreign police officers.The United Nations promised him the sending of a police force of 4,800 men.To date, Kouchner can only have 2,000 police officers.In addition, half of this group is from the United States and Germany.It is logical that the high representative of the UN in Kosovo is largely unhappy with this situation, especially if we take into account the endemic ethnic violence in this region.However, the lively reproaches that Kouchner addresses in recent days to the French government are astounding.Paris completely abandons his compatriot in the region by granting him a handful of police officers, no more than 37. According to Kouchner, the culprit of this unworthy position of France is none other than the Minister of the Interior, Jean-Pierre Chevènement.Still according to Kouchner, he would hinder the sending of French police officers to Kosovo for ideological reasons.I ask the Council and the Commission to deeply examine these serious accusations and to inform the European Parliament about it.Freedom of the press in Angola Mr. President, I will not repeat the premise of earlier: I could be accused of abusive advertising.On the question ""Angola"", I think that a first result is to finally have a resolution.It hadn't happened in our parliament for a very long time.So I greet it as such.I believe that the European Union and the West, in general, have been taking, for some time, Mr. Savimbi under their crossed shots, without any discrimination, but that corruption is now such in Mr. Dos Santos' regime that even his long -standing friends are starting to help to do as if they saw nothing.So, I believe that it is urgent to come to be able to make a general political resolution, where we could go to the bottom of things, in particular also on fairly disturbing things, of which we speak, in particular a given logistical support, at the level of intelligence services, by the United States and by Great Britain, the generalized corruption of the regime linked to multinational oil companies, and many other things, certainly very ""tasty""deepen."	fr
On the contrary, we must mobilize the working population of the Member States. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, I have a bit of the impression that some of the previous speakers did not read the entire report on the annual EU economy report on 1999 and consciously refused to hear my teammate Karl Von Wogaueuro. He points out the problems that occurred in 1999, but also that despite these problems there was monetary stability, price stability, increased employment and the beginning of a phase of recovery, so unemployment was able to begin. It demonstrates the perspective of the arriving recovery and the prospects and measures necessary, which was subsequently completed by Karl Von Wogau. I am glad that the confrontation is so harsh here, because this also clearly shows that there are different approaches to economic policy. We want to continue, accelerate and fill in the necessary measures the successful European course towards growth, employment and a functional internal market. The left of the body does not want this course to continue and it makes great dramatizations such as: We need state intervention rather than the continuation and strengthening of market economy. State intervention has so far led to debt increase and debt increase has always damaged growth and employment as well as social justice. This is the confrontation here in the body. I would like to tell you that we want more freedom and less state involvement. Growth and employment are created thanks to businesses that operate in favorable conditions and not thanks to state intervention! Mr President, the European Union's financial balance sheet in terms of workers is eighteen million unemployed, is the generalization of uncertainty, low wages, the deterioration of working conditions. The Commission has the cynicism to consider wage restriction positive, while in France alone more than three million workers receive a salary close to the poverty line and survive just better than the other three million who remain unemployed because of an irrational economy. However, you will never suggest that you limit shareholders' incomes, which are much higher from the beginning and which each year increases outrageously. Your balance sheet is all these big trasts that remove jobs even though they have increased profits, which often make redundancies simply to contain the price of their stocks on the Stock Exchange. Eleven thousand jobs were abolished at Hoechst and Rhone-Poulenc, twenty-two thousand in Unilever, ten thousand on ABB / Alstom Power, and we do not mention all the others. The economic growth of which you are proud of only a wealthy minority, owners and shareholders of large industrial and banking groups. Be careful, however, the unpredictable reactions on the part of the workers and the unemployed who are constantly reiterating that everything is going for the better, while they find that their lives are not improved, but on the contrary it is degraded.	el
Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the Commission on the following approach. I find it extremely positive that the dialogue with citizens begins so early, which unfortunately did not happen with the conditions of Amsterdam and Maastricht, thus dealing with our work often with mistrust. Two questions: First, you stated that you will start the dialogue with the citizens and you are already starting with the 700 trainees in the European Commission. Do you intend to contact citizens through the media, such as television and the internet? And a second, more critical question below: The European Commission has just submitted a proposal on transparency. This proposal is paid to the policy of transparency we apply to our legislation in the Netherlands, a policy that was nevertheless strongly criticized by Dutch public opinion. I ask how you intend to secure transparency for the intergovernmental conference. I say this because the directive submitted is not a good example of transparency. Master MP, Mrs. Minister Maij-Weggen, since we are talking about the transparency of the IMF, you know well how things will be. Negotiations are starting at this time. The team of representatives meet in Brussels, and I will try to meet her in a little while. The documents will mostly be open, work documents. We are not going to discuss the presence of the media during the trading meetings that will be held all year between the Ministers and the European Council, but I committed - it is all I can do at this stage - to apply this transparency and inform the most appropriate levels and the most appropriate levels. I assure you, and thank you for your question, how we will use all modern media, and especially television, which will be able to relay to our different countries, and even at European level, our public discussions. We will launch a forum on the Internet and create a permanent discussion forum. Commissioners will be pledged to answer quickly to all the questions asked. We will use all these modern media. But I think we should also try to approach the world as much as possible. I would like in all regions of Europe - it is probably still a bit utopian - a commissioner can be present in public discussions whenever a European Member or Minister can be present in public discussions. I can prove that it is possible. Most of you have these discussions in their constituencies, in their regions. From the somewhat more selfish view of the committee, I would like this institution to acquire a person for the citizens, men and women who are able to seek as often as possible with citizens as possible. Mr President, I welcome the commitment that Mr Barnier has moved to the regions in order to explain and hear what the citizens have to say. I would like to invite him to my own district of Yorkshire, an important European region that is fully involved in the single European market and is a key recipient of the resources of European Structural Funds.	el
We are after the stability of the financial markets, not because it is the goodwill of the financial markets, but because it is also of our growth, our investments, our jobs within the European Union.In this regard, we must ask ourselves which instruments we have to effectively generate a certain order, which is lacking so far.We have all contributed to the liberalization of financial transactions;To date, however, we do not have any regulatory framework that works and we have experienced it bitter experience with the repercussions of crises in Asia and Latin America.It is therefore more than time than we plan, Primo, control rules and, Secundo, the transparency of the financial markets and the information relating to it.It is important that we know the actors and their solvency.We must also ask ourselves if there is not a requirement for tax justice.At a time when, both European and international, the tax burden weighing on the work factor is increasing, we must question how to achieve effective taxation of capital income and, in this area, we must also question the taxation of short -term financial transactions.I believe that it is really important to have a meticulous report and conclusions of the Commission so that we can see, as a European Parliament, if the European Union must not ensure, in concert with the USA and Japan, to actually achieve international solidarity in order to increase the stability and security of the economy and the financial markets.This is the intention that underlies this oral question and we will have to, within the Parliament, within the framework of the regulatory procedures passing through the commissions and the plenary meetings, to reach a balanced and really carrier proposal for the future.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, I must express, on behalf of the group of the European Party of Liberals Democrats and Reformers, my surprise in the face of the debate which currently occupies us on international capital flows and their possible tax tax.Although this is not mentioned in the text, it looks like an attempt to resuscitate, as was done in the introduction, the question of the tax proposed a few years ago by Mr. Tobin, to which our group opposed in a clear and categorical manner, during the previous legislature with a series of arguments exposed with clarity and coherence by our president, Mr. Cox.Arguments that, modestly, I will have to repeat during my intervention since the question rests.We do not agree with this type of taxation because its application, provided that it is possible, would not serve the objectives that Mr. Tobin presented in his time and that the left of this assembly seems to want to resuscitate.First of all, there is no evidence that the taxation of the international flow of capital could reduce the risk of volatility or instability of international markets.On the contrary, as it is certain that not all countries accept it, we would open a path to speculation and fraud, which would cause volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services which operate internationally.In addition, the idea of ​​obtaining resources in order to use them for economically more needy countries is so complex, when you think of its application in practice, that it is simply impossible.	fr
Does the new text even allow the consumer to easily distinguish the wrong and real chocolate? No, since the text of the directive is fraudulent in the sense that it provides for the possibility of adding a very accurate percentage of chocolate (5 %) of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter, even though we do not have a reliable analysis method to monitor it. The Commission thus sets a percentage of which it knows that it cannot be confirmed. This is called a scam. The text also contains fraudulent regulations on markings. In the first treatment, our parliamentaryly approved the review by the rapporteur Lannoye, according to which the reverse side of the product must be stated in a clearly readable form that the product contains vegetable fats other than cocoa butter. Since the Council did not accept this review, the consumer will not receive appropriate information. Thus, in all countries and all real chocolate lovers, it may be possible to make the name of chocolate completely legally contain completely distorted products. In this way, the definition of one of our basic foods is changed for the benefit of a community system that constantly narrows the responsibility of all, and this is done only because a few supranational companies can maximize their profits. Chocolate lovers, enjoy the devotion of your next Easter egg! It's the last time you can be sure that they are made of real and genuine chocolate made before great harmonization. But who wants to eat chocolate after that?.(Fr) How we get into the markings ... Here's a separate sign of Europe that we now want to strengthen. This entry, like the French NF environment, is a voluntary brand, ie companies must apply for it. It is granted on comprehensive grounds that take into account the entire life cycle of the product. However, not all national signs should be transferred to the background. Namely, consumers, or buyers, have their own habits, and they have begun to rely on the characters they know. If the national brand were to be replaced, it would once again confuse the citizens living in the European Union who are lost in the jungle of product labels, quality markings, logos, regional references and other information. One could almost imagine looking at a chocolate bar ... Because it is especially important for us that SMEs have access to the community's environmental branded system and to improve them, we give our support to the rapporteur..(EN) Dear President, I support all my heart that Europe strives to be an environmentally friendly continent. This measure is another indication that the EU wants to improve its ways in the greener direction. Since 1992, the flower brand of the eco -brand has been a hallmark of environmental -saving products, from washing machines to letter paper. Still, the industry has not been as enthusiastic about environmental -saving products as consumers. Hopefully, however, this three -year strategy will make the manufacturers come along. The Government of the British Labor Party has, of course, been pioneers to clean our planet. In Kyoto, for example, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott, contrary to all expectations, resulted in an agreement on global emission reduction. The United Kingdom is already at a good pace to reach its goal of reducing carbon dioxide emissions by 20 % by 2010. However, the government has not been content with this, but has recently raised the target to 60-70 % by 2050. Parliament should challenge other Member States to follow the example of the UK. They have the opportunity to take the challenge at the Kyoto monitoring conference in Hague in November. Of course, protecting the globe means much more than just cleaning the atmosphere. It also means protecting the natural environment on the surface of the earth. Here too, the Government of the UK Labor Party is in the forefront. For example, its recent bill on nature protects endangered species better than ever. In addition, everyman's right-type legislation gives the British freedom to enjoy and admire our beautiful countryside. Mr President, at the local, national and European level, is urgently needed to clean our country, the sea and to announce.	fi
"Although it is forced to accept a decision that accepts special measures to eradicate any kind of discrimination from the labor market, which would probably be targeted by asylum seekers who, according to the definition, still have to hold on to this concept of legality: it is clearly justified by the fact that, even if it is fully reasonsIn the case of many other groups listed, those who have submitted the application for asylum, those in need of temporary protection, those who have not been granted a refugee status and are threatened by the expulsion to which the report promises corresponding support. The support measures presented in the report threaten to spread more widespread: of course, the support applies to asylum seekers, then it could also apply to asylum seekers waiting for a temporary protection decision and finally dismissed by decisions, and should all be includedA position that has been denied refugee status and threatened by expulsion could be like the status of an illegal migrant?, at least for the latter, they should be excluded from an integration policy where their stay in the community is neither legal or regulatory. Such a message would deliberately or unintentionally mean an excellent call for migration, which was granted, or not to justify a group of support, which should lead to the applicant's permanent integration of the labor market, where legal, foreign or indigenous residents are. The end result is that, despite the general guidelines that could be agreed, it could not be thought that I would in favor of a report that meant the seed of a new attack in itself against the concepts of citizenship and republication that are particularly important to me. Lieneemann's recommendation for second treatment (A5-0027/2000) Mr President, one of us should remember a success film called ""Cocoon - youth"", where the elderly will become young after drinking special quality water. So I think it is very important to pay great attention to the water that we all drink and follow the actions that are related to and accepting it. For this reason, I accepted this action, but I would like to emphasize my wish to ensure that the purity of the water in our homes is as high as possible. So I notice that the procedure is missing - but I trust that it will be corrected in the future - providing support for those who purify the water in their own home..(ES) Except 76, which I was wrong about which I intended to vote for the rest of my voting decisions, could be explained by the following imaginary story. Assumed Environmental Directive: Directive of the European Parliament and of the Council obliges to maintain temperature in the streets, squares and parks of European cities in winter at least 18 degrees Celsius. General Directive: (a) Each city must find the means and adequate technology for sufficient energy to achieve this goal by 2012;(b) The cost is shared in its entirety between the inhabitants of each city so that they are part of the price of electricity. The opinion of a member of Northern Europe: ""This directive would be unfair, as the cost per capita would be 200 times higher for the Stockholm, for example, than for Naples.""The opinion of a member of Southern Europe: ""However, this is about competitiveness and equitable conditions.""(The imaginary part ends here). A member currently explaining his voting behavior considers the existence of a water directive as a positive issue, but believes that Europe cannot be built on the basis of environmental inflexibility, resulting in a legislative grin. Countries such as Mediterranean countries, which are characterized by floods and drought, and northern countries of regular rainfall cannot be treated in the same way."	fi
The European car fleet comprises tens of millions of cars that should be taken back without being designed for recycling. The common position was more effective as it set up the date of 2006 for the vehicles already in use. In addition, companies would be able to raise funds to cover additional costs. So, like my group, I support a common position, which I think is a balanced compromise between the laws of companies and the promotion of environmental protection. Mr President, good colleagues, the European Parliament must make an important decision today. Are we striving for advanced environmental and consumer protection, or will Parliament a servant of the German automotive industry, such as Florenz, Langen and others, are subject to fear? Parliament credibility as a pioneer in environmental protection is at stake. It would be more shameful if the EP propose less minor provisions on the responsibility and environmental protection of producers than 14 Member States and the European Commission! The purpose of Florenz and Langen's checks is clear: the directive must be nullified! The proposed shared liability is intended to water the principle of causing the cause and to slow down production innovation. By erecting numerous obstacles, you want nothing but to prevent an effective environmentally friendly material flow policy, and with type approval, you want to delay the implementation of the Directive by 12 or more years. It is absolutely impossible to accept. That's why I especially appeal to the German members of the Parliament: Do not allow great political damage today! The German Red Green Federal Government did not gain a reputation in the debate on the Scrap Directive. Don't continue the same way! The complaint about the decline in competitiveness is ridiculous, when it comes to a decline in the competitiveness of the German automotive industry. Be representatives of the people and not allow yourself to be represented by Volkswagen! Vote for environmental and consumer protection and innovation in the automotive and recycling industry! Mr President, this directive has been discussed since 1997. It was high time for us to reach an agreement on it. Because I agree more or less about what my colleague Sjöstedt and the green group represented de Roo have said, I do not intend to spend completely two minutes of speech time and emphasize only two questions. First of all, I would emphasize, and it is perhaps the most important in the proposal, the idea of ​​waste recycling and use that would use materials that may be less contaminated afterwards. Another important thing is that waste should not be burned or crushed, no lead, cadmium and mercury waste, nor waste containing PVC. This topic is discussed in Parliament in another context. Another question is about who has to pay the expenses. I agree with the previous speakers that the pollution pays and is particularly true in this proposal. Producers have to pay, even though we all know that in the end, the costs may be reflected in consumers, and they must bear the cost before 2006, as suggested in some reviews. In our opinion, the first treatment check is better. It is also important to set a certain percentage and date when vehicles must have recyclable materials. In my opinion, the deadline for the proposal is very long. Mr President, I finally believe that it is important to promote the creation of small and medium -sized enterprises, as they can promote job creation in this important field, avoiding large -scale monopols. Mr President, the European Parliament, usually does its best, under the leadership of environmental, public health and consumer policy, to critically evaluate the proposals of the European Commission and the Council to improve them in terms of environmental aspects. Now, in this Parliament, there is a risk that the exact common position of the Council will be impaired in terms of environmental aspects. We reject a lot of cars with dangerous substances each year. Therefore, prevention of waste is important. In addition, we must seek to minimize heavy metals and other hazardous substances and materials.	fi
I am aware of the restrictions, since we are working under the existing treaty and are limited by its rules of operation - I refer to the important issue of tax in particular. But I would just like to avoid talking about tax matters. I will start welcoming some suggestions you submit for this 2000 program. I refer to all food safety proposals, which are ambitious and important, as well as to sea safety, after the two oil spills caused off the offenses of Brittany and Turkey. It is advisable for the committee to react quickly to this issue. On other issues, on the contrary, I think we can be more ambitious, move on faster. I even want to submit some positive proposals, in particular the social sector, the environment and the continuation that will be given after Seattle. First of all, an observation: You said that we must reconcile the European citizen with the institutions, a fact, and I find it important to wonder what the most serious concerns of the citizens are. I think e.g. How it is not enough to announce a announcement of a social measures program. We have to move on faster. You must submit to us at the end of the year a new social measures program. Finally, a topic that has been up to date, and still concerned with it, is about closing businesses and mass redundancies. We are working on the basis of an existing directive that has proven its limits and we would like - I submit the proposal - to review this Directive text in order to make it more effective in terms of both employment protection and any sanctions on those who violate the Directive. In the environment of the environment you are announcing a proposal for a sixth environmental program for the environment, which is commendable. I dared to say - but maybe you deny me - that the text you suggest will not contain specific goals or timetable implementation. Personally, I find it necessary to have quantitative goals and a true timetable for implementation. I also believe that, in terms of civil liability, it is fortunate that we are finally having a White Paper, and I am referring to civil liability over the environment, but I remind you that parliament is calling for a legislative initiative for six years and that the White Paper has been announcing it. And in this respect, I draw your attention to the fact that we need to speed up developments. Finally, after Kyoto it would be reasonable to get to specific suggestions soon, and I end in a nutshell. I believe that the possibility of starting a new round of overall negotiations is not necessarily bad, but I believe, and I repeat that there is really a need to be submitted by the proposals in order to change the WTO's operating rules. The Commission plays a role within the Union, but also a global role. I believe that the European Union must be on the basis of a re -evaluation of the WTO's operation, a re -evaluation that should lead us to submit specific proposals for its statutes. Madam President, you talked about fundamental political values ​​and one of the fundamental political values, more important than democracy, is the respect of others.	el
(Applause on the right) It is by diplomacy, persuasion, culture, solidarity, and not by unconstitutional means, that institutions can be respected and enforce the principles.Bilateral relations involve states, the fourteen member states therefore have nothing to do with it.This amounts to replacing European institutions to defend political logics with incompetence worthy of parties barely out of totalitarian systems and not representatives of democratic traditions.As we have already written several times, many things, too many things separate us from Haider, in particular his claims on the Haut-Adige which is very Italian.We knew it.Today, we see with anguish that other representatives of the Union seem to have renounced the democratic role of Europe.We are in favor of legality and democracy expressed by peoples, respect for national sovereignty provided that it does not violate the principles of the treaty or human rights.We believe in Europe, while others seem to have started the union disintegration process.These are the results of hasty enlargement, a lack of clarity in terms of roles and duties.Europe has been created from the circus market, not that of principles, rights and politics.These are the consequences!We can therefore only invite the Commission to continue on the path of moderation and to support those who work so that the autonomy and sovereignty of the Austrian people are respected, while ensuring that these people remain free and united towards others.Madam President, dear colleagues, we have an appointment today with hypocrisy.We have a council which managed to ignore the treaty and to use a method completely outside of article 6 and article 7 which allowed, in the event of serious and persistent violations, to condemn a state.In this case, there are no serious and persistent violations in Austria.There are risks - we are all aware of this - but there is absolutely, as it stands, no violation of neither serious or persistent.If we were to apply the criteria of article 6 and article 7, if we were to apply the criteria of Copenhagen to our institutions, to the European Union, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, as requested from the countries of Eastern Europe.And if we are talking about serious and persistent violations, we can perhaps speak of certain Member States, we can speak of Italy and France, respectively first and third country sentenced by the Council of Europe, by the Strasbourg Court.We can speak, dear Belgian colleagues, of Belgium, of the Dutroux affair, dozens and dozens of children removed, tortured, raped, murdered by personalities from this country and whose surveys are enclosed, always sagged.We could, dear colleagues, a third of the deputies, impose on the board and the commission to wonder about it.We could question the fact that the Austrians reject ten years, thirteen years of particracy which has corrupted and rotten a country - Austria - as it is to rot and corrupt countries like Italy, Belgium and other member countries of the Union.	fr
Also, respect for international treaties, such as e.g. The Ospar Treaty. Third, we want the prices policy to be clearly formulated. This implies that the basic principle that must apply is to pay for actual water costs. Today taxpayers often subsidize industry and agriculture. The self -evident principle for legislation must be that anyone who pollutes or abuses must pay, even if in some extreme cases exceptions may be required. Fourth, we want the exceptions from the rules in the water quality sector to be few and clearly defined. Fifth, we want the protection of groundwater quality to be clear, as well as the measures to be taken to tackle the continuing groundwater pollution. On the basis of the above, our team may vote in favor of many of the rapporteur's amendment proposals, Mr. Lienemann, in the form of they were approved by the Parliamentary Committee. In a couple of points we would like to take more steps. For this reason we will vote in favor of the amendment proposals no.102, 103 and 104 of the Greens, which we consider to further improve the common position. As far as price determination is concerned, there are sometimes extreme situations that may require exceptions from the authorities of the report. Personally, I find that in the amendment proposal no.43 of the Parliamentary Committee shall fully satisfy the possibilities of exemption and in the amendment proposal no.105 Greens are even better formulated. I cannot think that there is a need for additional exceptions beyond those specified in these two amendments. But in this matter there are different views in our team. The amendment proposal no.107, which concerns this issue, has been subjected to a part of our team. Overall, I believe that the proposals of the Parliamentary Committee on the Lienemann exhibition are good and can be a good basis for a difficult conciliation. Mr President, all the photos taken by satellites prove that we are inhabited on the blue planet: this aquatic wealth is a delusion. The most recent disaster caused by the Danube reminds us that rivers and rivers are vital arteries on our planet and that pollution has no borders. Water is a renewable and limited natural resource. It begins to rarely be subject to proper management and when geographical and climate conditions are not favorable. As part of the Union, this problem is critical in the Mediterranean region, but also in other European countries, where we observe the gradual drying of wetlands. There are many elements that we want to recall: sensitive areas, wetlands or arid areas, inequalities between states, inequalities between different areas within the states, climate, economic, geographical and geological particularities. But these should not, however, lead us to distorts of competition in the community. However, we have submitted amendments to recall the importance of the particular relationship of agriculture with water, which is a major factor in the employment and exploitation of the soil. It goes without saying that the needs of agriculture in the south are clearly greater and that this particularity must be taken into account in the framework directive.	el
"There are two reasons for our refusal.It is, Primo, a terribly complex and very sensitive legal question, and the proposal presents, in my eyes, certain risks for legal certainty which has not been aware.This reason is sufficient in itself to explain our refusal to vote the proposal, but there is a second reason: even if it is an agreement, that is to say a collaboration between states, the proposal gives off very clear trends, namely the creation, in the longer term, of a common European jurisdictional space, a common European penal code and a common common administration of justice.We are opposed to this evolution, we are against this mantra ""a space of freedom, security and justice"", which consists in creating in a barbaric manner of community systems, certain legal traditions linked to these sensitive and important questions, which are above all national prerogatives.Mr. President, I too think that the convention that we examine today is only a small step, still too small, in the construction of this common space of freedom, security and justice that - we hope - Europe will be one day.Europe is today a space for the free movement of goods and people where crime knows no borders, while obstacles that are difficult to overcome still stand on the way to those who have to fight it.A small step - I said - but which is welcome.The Committee on Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs has precisely wanted to prescribe other limits and protections in the name of the defense of the fundamental rights of persons, which are in force in the States and within the Union, even if they are not yet devoted to a Charter of the Rights of the European Union which, we hope, will soon see the light of day: just limits and protections because the rights in forcerespected by all public authorities of all states.In certain passages of the commission's proposals, no doubt we have exaggerated in terms of precautions as when you wanted to give the accused the choice to accept or refuse his temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the requirements of the instruction.Personally, I cannot accept, for example, that Mr. Pinochet is authorized to choose to be transferred or not to Spain for a confrontation.Or, when you wanted the witness or the expert - and not only the person under investigation, the accused - is entitled to a defender for remote interrogations.These are slight faults, not wanted by the rapporteur, to which will remedy - I hope - the vote of this assembly.The rapporteur has done a work worthy of praise, which I take note of which I thank him for.The overall result is appreciable and I hope that the council will take fully into account.Like other deputies have already pointed out, a point - the most delicate - remains unresolved: it is article 18 of the convention concerning the interception of communications which intervene in a Member State, carried out directly by another Member State without requesting mutual aid of the State where the interception takes place, proceedings made possible today thanks to modern technologies."	fr
The European Council of Helsinki approved the enlargement to 13 Member States.There is therefore inconsistency between the opening of membership negotiations with these 13 countries and the wish to proceed only to a minimis reform.As far as we are concerned, located in the logic of the treaty, we want the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference to allow a much deeper reform of the union.That said, Mr. President, the Parliament is holding this debate today because he did not want to delay the start of the conference.Theoretically, we could have done it.We could have voted on the 17th of this month, so that the conference could not have started on the 14th. But we did not want to do so, because we wanted to send a clear political message to governments and countries candidate for membership: we want to carry out this reform to facilitate enlargement.Mr. President, I am delighted to be able to say it to the Portuguese presidency, because she has acquired great esteem in this assembly.The Portuguese presidency shares a number of aspirations of this Parliament and is committed to doing their best so that the agenda of the intergovernmental conference includes other subjects, which are absolutely necessary.I want to say, Mr. President, that this aspiration of the European Parliament is disinterested.The latter, in any case, will be politically reinforced by the treaty from this intergovernmental conference, simply because during this intergovernmental conference, in accordance with what was decided in Helsinki, we will examine which matters currently subject to unanimousness will pass to the qualified majority.The number of matters decided by qualified majority will therefore increase.However, the community acquired already provides that the legislative matters decided by qualified majority will also be subject to the codecision of the Parliament.Consequently, if there is an extension of the qualified majority, there will also be expanding the codecision of the Parliament.But the Parliament would not accomplish its task of supranational European institution if he did not think of the political project of the Union.We are going there.We believe that other questions should be tackled with a view to this Union political project.Among other questions, those linked to integration into the treaty of security and defense problems, subjects that have progressed a lot lately but which should be introduced into the treaty.The same goes for the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, of course, of which we started the editorial staff yesterday, and I believe that this beginning was carried out in a very positive way.We will work seriously so that Europeans see that being European represents a plus and that European citizen has fundamental rights which bind the institutions of the Union.Consequently, Mr. President, our proposals, which we will concretize in a new report, will constitute, with the proposals of the Commission, which produced an excellent document I am delighted to provide it here to Mr. Barnier, documents of the conference.	fr
But the decision of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best that could be achieved.There are some weaknesses.In my view, the biggest weakness is that the situation of medium -sized companies is not sufficiently taken into account, but the automotive industry does not only consist of large companies.SMEs play a very important role, especially in the supply area, and we also have to take into account the interests of employees in these small and medium -sized companies.Then there are far more than two million people who find their jobs in this area.This situation of medium -sized companies also serve many amendments to the Committee on Environmental Questions, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the present amendments to our faction on Article 5 regarding the costs.The common point of view is also not a glossy performance.There is no look for the big relationships, and if the colleague says of the Greens, it would be the first time that the European Parliament weakens a common point of view, then you cannot say that, because it does not make sense in terms of environmental policy that we are using rigid, high recycled quotas of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-liter car, where a lot of plastic is used!Therefore, one has to support an amendment that at least allows exceptions if we have particularly economical cars.The objections of industry in this area are certainly not illogical.The argumentation force of the plastic and auto industry would also increase if one would not only get involved in the reduction of CO2 in Europe in this context.Mr President, we are currently in an unusual situation: Those who want to work for the environmental values ​​represent the common point of view of the council.In contrast to my previous speaker, I am really proud that we have achieved a common point of view during the Finnish presidency in which the environmental values ​​are defended.When we tip the common point of view and try to share the disposal costs, we create loopholes: we do not bring a reasonable, clear system in which the responsibilities are regulated.Therefore, in my opinion, the main responsibility must be with the manufacturer.This is the only way we can solve the problem sufficiently and also create incentives for the manufacturers to produce vehicles that can be disposed of in the future as cost -effective as possible.President!The council's draft guidelines contains two fundamental problems.On the one hand, this is the unrestricted commitment of the manufacturers to withdraw waste vehicles.Here there is a risk that a monopoly situation will be created in the dismantling of the dismantling, especially in areas with long distances and numerous small businesses dealing with dismantling.I believe that an EU directive, regardless of its content, must not disadvantage medium-sized companies within the Union.The manufacturers' unreserved responsibility also endangers the used goods market, since the manufacturer is obliged to sell new parts to a greater extent.However, this trade is particularly important for those who collect and overtake older vehicles.From a market economy perspective, too, this principle is rather doubtful.Companies must change, have to be sold and liquidated.You have to be able to establish yourself in new markets and also be able to leave old markets.Binding the manufacturers to a responsibility that can extend very far into the past fits badly into a flexible and development -promoting market economy.	de
"There is a lot of pain and suffering in Kosovo. People show their mind and they send us an email. They ask: Where are our children, where are our sons? We have to give those questions the right answers. Flora Brovina's case is only one of the others. It is right that we mention it in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds and thousands of people like Flora Brovina. I am asking the Commission and the absent council to do something about their political prisoners. The fact that they are imprisoned in Serbia is partly the cause of Kosovo's unrest and violence. The Mr President, in paragraph 10 of the present joint resolution proposal, requires the Council and the Member States of the European Union to double their efforts to allow the UN police force to have the necessary workforce and the necessary resources. This request corresponds entirely to Bernard Kouchner, a high -level UN high -level representative in Kosovo. In order to fulfill his duties to restore and preserve the general order of Kosovo, he or she needs at least 6,000 foreign police authorities. Instead, the UN has promised to send him 4,800 police officers. By the way, half of this group comes from the United States and Germany. It is logical that a UN high -level representative in Kosovo is very dissatisfied with this situation, especially because ethnic violence is so widespread in the area. However, the sharp criticism of Kouchner has recently targeted at the French government is confusing. Paris leaves his compatriot to his own fortune in a crisis area and sends only a handful of police officers, not more than 37. Kouchner has accused Chevènement, Minister of the Internal Affairs for this questionable attitude of France. According to Kouchner, the minister prevents ideological reasons from sending French police to Kosovo. I ask the Council and the Commission to investigate these serious accusations and to inform the European Parliament. President of the press in Angola, I do not another recent reason: I might be blamed for false advertising. For the ""Angola"" question, I think the first result is that we finally have a resolution. This has not happened in our Parliament for a very long time. Thus, I am just congratulated for this achievement. I believe that the European Union and the Western countries have generally been setting their crossfires for Savimb without any discrimination, but bribery has now reached such proportions in the administration of Dos Santos that even his long -term friends are difficult to pretend that they do not notice anything. In my opinion, it is urgent that we are able to draw up a general political resolution where we can deal with issues thoroughly, and in particular quite worrying issues that are to be addressed deeper, especially the logistical support provided by the United States and the UK intelligence services, the general corrupting of the oil sector. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, the European Parliament has been, and very successful, at the forefront of strengthening human rights in the European Union. We know that governments are often more sensitive to real policy demands and commercial, geopolitical or economic forecasts. We have set demands for states who want to join our Union and we have to set them on the states we support. After all, we are those who believe in democracy and the values ​​it represent. We know that the freedom of the press and the disclosed citizen of citizen are the lungs of democracy. Democracy does not exist if there is no free flow of information. And there is no democracy without free and enlightened citizens. Free and enlightened citizens do not exist without unable information activities, and non -steering information activities do not exist if suppliers are pressured, persecuted, arrested or threatened. Mr President, as rightly as we judge Unita's attitudes that questioned Angola's peace process, and using the same authority that we persuaded the parties to stop war and move to peace, now condemn persecution and threats, and demand the Freedom of the Angola Government."	fi
"Thank you very much, Madame Schreyer.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Votes (Parliament approves the commission's proposal) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).(En) Mr. President, it is a procedural motion.I would like to ask you for a clarification concerning the regulation: namely Regulation 133, paragraph 2 and 133, paragraph 4, both relating to the vote.With regard to votes other than votes by nominal appeal, these initially take place by hand and it is only when certain doubts emerge that electronic voting is used.Is it correct?Indeed, dear colleague, I voted by hand, since no group had asked for a vote by nominal appeal.You know that there is no nominal appeal or electronic verification only if colleagues ask for it.In this case, I assure you that there was a vast majority in favor of the directive that we have just voted.Mr. President, I did not refer to this particular vote but to votes in general.It is obvious that some presidents do not take care of the hands, so to speak, and directly proceed to the electronic vote.I was wondering if it was the correct procedure.I know it takes more time but should we not always first vote by hand?Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, with regard to this second reading, the Commission can accept the only amendment proposal advanced by the Parliament.The Commission takes up and accepts the amendment proposal.(The President declares approved the common position thus modified) Report (A5-0104/1999) of Mr. Koch, on behalf of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a directive of the European Parliament and the Council amending Directive 94/55/EC relating to the merger of the laws of the Member States concerning the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM (1999) 0158-C5-0004/1999-1999/0083 (COD)) (Parliament adopts the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0108/1999) of Ms. Schroedter, in the name of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on Commission Communication ""Structural funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund.

However, I also think that reforms have to go further than what we now decide here in Parliament. For example, I think it is worth considering that in areas where preparatory decisions are already made by court colleagues or individual judges like the courts - I mention only the word Alicante (the inner market harmonization agency) or how it is designed for European official legislation -, the first court courtcompetence. I also believe that we are likely to do something about the European Commission's trends regarding the re -nationalization of competition decisions and the diversification of the national level. It seems to me that it is necessary in this regard, as these cases will no longer be dealt with by the first court court, but are treated as decisions requested by a preliminary ruling in the Court of Communities. We should consider how we can survive this situation. Decisions on competition issues to request a preliminary ruling may also be possible to make the first court in the special division of the court. In addition, we also have to consider whether or not we were right - and we had just cases where parliamentary members or political groups have also brought action against the European Parliament - that such issues fall within the jurisdiction of the first court court, even though they actually concerning constitutional issues, and these matters are logical. Last paragraph: I also believe that Olaf needs law -state control. Currently, Olaf is in a vacuum for supervision and can do what he wants. I find it necessary to supervise Olafia. The only court who can do it in a reasonable way would be the first court court. It would also be a impetus for continuing the reform process. Mr President, I would like to start like others by congratulations on this job. The European Union is a law -based system. It must therefore have a court system for the enforcement of the law. Besides, unless the courts are able to handle the workload properly and quickly, as a member Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, and as we know that too late a right is not a right at all. According to the information obtained from the court, this is now the case and refers to the actions that can now be taken to relieve the problem. However, as the rapporteur Marinho pointed out, even more is needed, but it may remain in HVK. Mythology in my country talks about the buzzing herds of faceless bureaucrats in Brussels, but it never mentions the number of community judges. At the top of the European legal order, there are less than three dozen of them - hardly too much when thinking about their responsible role at the heart of the European legal system. Their importance is reflected in the political consequences that have been delayed by the dispute over the resolution of British and French. The delay in my country has caused a lot of anger and frustration with the Union dispute resolution procedures. As some of those who advise me, this has only been exacerbated by the Rules of Procedure applied in French courts, according to which non -French citizens are almost impossible to take a trial against the French government. At least it is considered to be impossible to de facto. Unfortunately, this is very unlike in the United Kingdom's courts, where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom in a very similar situation. The Mr President, at first glance, Prima Facie, seems that the case of France is about discrimination against other EU citizens on the basis of citizenship, which is contrary to the Treaties. So I would like to ask a member of the Commission, who kindly commented on the observations I have made in the previous debate, to look at this issue, and to inform the Parliament and to me about his findings. I would be grateful if a member of the Commission could confirm that he would do so.	fi
In fact, about four times the fee is charged.The more remote the community, the greater the difference.This is how the problem can be measured.It is not directed against liberalization if it is required to take these factors into account and to enable the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service.In the name of all of our remote and island communities, wherever they may be in the European Union, and not only on behalf of the population in Scotland, I request that you receive the vital line that the postal service represents.President!I consider it a privilege to be able to represent my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, in a qualitatively high -ranking debate about postal services.I want to try to give an answer to the questions raised in the discussion based on the information that Commissioner Bolkestein sent to me.I would like to repeat that Commissioner Bolkestein will be available to the parliamentary committee for regional policy, transport and tourism on Monday.Some MPs, as Mr. Stenmarck, complain that there were delays with the new proposal.Others believe that it is not bad if a little break occurs after the first liberalization step.This is the opinion, for example, Mr. Berthu.The commission's point of view is that the delays in connection with the new proposal are mainly due to the main problems that should not be completely unknown to Parliament.However, we think there is a legal obligation that a proposal will be submitted.It is Commissioner Bolkestein intention to present the Commission such a proposal for acceptance in the first half of this year.January 1, 2003 as a planned date for the implementation of the next steps is still feasible.The proposal will take into account the studies carried out and, in particular, check questions such as universal service that I will come back to.As for the valid guideline and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to implement them.A number of problems are related to the structure of the regulator and its independence.The appointment of the implementation for the Member States is January 2003. Further liberalization will be carried out afterwards.The competition already takes place in some areas, for example in the parcel service and in the press service.The quality of the services has generally improved, especially in cross -border traffic.The quality of the services so important for consumers was the main concern of all speakers, and some of them, like Mr. Rübig, were very clear on this question.The experiences in the countries in which liberalization has already progressed, such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, show that the quality of the service, if the liberalization runs properly, can be increased as a result of the requirements for a higher quality of the service placed by national regulations and the following measures.So there is no sale of the service and its quality.Often liberalizations lead to guaranteed standards, and the continuous standardization of the measurement of the service quality also contributes to this, since these standards better reflect the actual performance.This allows sensible benchmarking and, as a result of the bundled pressure, regulators, competitors and customers an improved customer orientation by the responsible operator.	de
This system seems unsuitable for us.As a compensation for this, however, all possible obstacles must be eliminated before issuing the service certificate and, compared to the commission proposal, tightened conditions for the issuing of the service certificate must be met.The requirements of proper employment, legal stay and insurance cover must not only be given at the time of the exhibition of the ID, but during the entire validity period of the ID and three months later.This should guarantee the reception state that the employee or the self -employed person returns to the sending state after the order made and is covered with insurance law in the event of illness and accident.The entry and residence situation should also be clarified before issuing the service certificate, as part of an objection procedure.We stipulate that the EU service ID must not only be applied for for all Member States, but that it can also be requested for individual Member States.I think this system also better meets the needs of practice.I hope for the proposal to reduce the minimum duration of the previous employment to three months and to orientate the duration of the service ID in the duration of the previous employment in a more flexible manner.However, we remain that the maximum validity period of the service certificate should be 12 months.For the self -employed, in addition to the changes already described, we also propose that the residence criterion must be tightened and that we provide for a way to counter a possible abuse by sham self -employment.I would also like to briefly go into the present amendments that go beyond the amendments of the committee for law and internal market.Of course, I would also like to say that I continue to support the changes submitted by the right committee that were unanimously accepted there.On behalf of my parliamentary group, I have brought four amendments myself, which essentially refer to the correct citation of a council decision.I have to say that I got extremely contradictory statements from the services of the parliament, how this Council decision should be correctly cited;Only with the number, only with the date, with both, how in detail is it cited from the council decision.Two amendments were canceled by the services because the content is allegedly already taken into account in the report.I withdraw the two further applications - that is applications 18 in the report on the self -employed and 21 with those dependent.I can only appeal to the President's conference to reach an agreement as quickly as possible, as can be done correctly in the question of comitology.That would make the life of the rapporteurs in this house much easier in the future.There is also a amendment to both reports from colleague de Palacio.Unfortunately, I have to say that I cannot support this change of change because he changed the result that we have found unanimously in the committee for law and internal market in the substance, and I would like to stay with what we found together as a result after long discussions.I can finally thank all colleagues who have stood by my right report in the right -wing committee.	de
But on the other hand, we must be careful not to somehow categorize some nations. Therefore, we are against point 4 of the common resolution, where Montenegro is mentioned. Of course there are also internal security problems, as in the EU. But today Montenegro is at particular risk and you hear that Milosevic was currently conducting military operations against Montenegro, which NATO officially said yesterday. We must be careful not to offer him pretexts. That is why, we say yes to the solidarity struggle against organized crime, but I beg you that there is no special reference to Montenegro rather than to support it on its difficult path for more freedom. Mr President, I find it very important that the convergence achieved in this plenary on a new initiative against organized crime, especially because it was perceived, starting with the group on behalf of which I am talking, that the dramatic episode of Brindis is not a phenomenon of Puglia and Puglia. Policy; it brings to light the problem of justice and security for the citizens of the Union. Parliament, the institutions of the Union, must take into account this perspective in order to reasonably respond to the feelings of fear and insecurity of citizens towards crime and to combat all its forms: the forms of brutal violence that does not hesitate to kill and kill their forcessupranational character. Due to the relations between the criminal groups of various countries, because of the increasing geographical framework, we need a supranational response. In addition, the issue of security is one of the goals of Amsterdam's Europe and was discussed by the Tampere European Council that took place in the fall of 1999. We hope that specific decisions such as those proposed in Tampere will be made in the creation of a common research teams such as a European Police Officer. On this path we must walk, taking into account, in the Union's relations with the Balkan countries, the fight against crime in these countries. Finally, let me also share the pain of the families of the victims and to express this solidarity and recognition of the high sense of duty that these two police men showed on February 24th..((()) The Commission examined with great interest the resolution regarding the threat of increasing illegal activities of criminal groups acting in various countries in Southeast Europe. We share the concern expressed by this resolution about the risk of seeing the efforts to reconstitute and grow in the context of the stability pact of international criminal networks that are mainly involved in slave trade and drug smuggling. Of course, many of these activities have particularly negative consequences for the community and its Member States.	el
The agreement with Macedonia must be able to be considered as an open door for a membership of the country to the European Union, even if it should not be considered in the very long term.Meanwhile, our policy must tend to ensure that Macedonian legislation is starting to resemble that of the Member States and our policy must reflect this fact even in the names of the Macedonian aid programs.I am thinking here of the flagship program.The name of the Republic, Mr. President, is still a problem due to the Greek susceptibilities.I leave from the principle that the Member States will feel more and more free to use in their own language the name suitable for the Republic.If some countries wish to keep the words ex-Yugoslavia, it is their business, others should not be obliged to it.There is no question of keeping us constantly under pressure.This is why I support Mr. Swoboda's intelligent report;He did not get us used to something else and this also explains my glowing terms about the respectable republic of Macedonia.Mr. President, dear colleagues, allow me above all to say how much I appreciated, personally, the quality of the rapporteur's work, Mr. Swoboda.Today, we decide in favor of the opening of negotiations relating to a stabilization and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.We do it knowing that this decision, the very first concerning the region, is part of a completely new phase of our relations with the Balkans.It itself constitutes a factor in this new phase, or rather this new policy which determines, with a view to European integration of the region, the only possibility of peaceful settlement of conflicts which agitate the Balkans.Our agreement concerning the negotiation mandate results, as the rapporteur explains in his presentation of reasons, the conviction that must be added to the Union policy, either a regional dimension, or a more specific valuation of the efforts and results of the different countries on the path of the integration of the acquis community.It is this double objective that in my opinion, we must continue: on the one hand, we must support the relative programs, for example, to infrastructure, prepare the stages of the introduction of free trade - even if this is premature - and encourage initiatives of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries of the region;On the other hand, it is necessary to create today with the old Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia a closer integration policy model.That said, we cannot, for various reasons, only send a favorable opinion.As our missions have noted in Skopje, in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, sensitive economic progress is recorded in terms of democratic advances and that, more delicate and difficult in this region, of the cohabitation of several ethnicities.In addition, the country has paid the high price of war in neighboring Kosovo, whether in terms of logistical support for NATO forces or export decreases to northern Europe.	fr
"In this context, it must be clearly said which criteria should be used to select these rights.In my opinion, the essential criterion in the rights of citizens against the European institutions.These are the rights of citizens that result from the European project stipulated in the Union contracts.I understand your concern about the rights of the children.In my opinion, part of our work and especially my work as the responsible person for the judiciary and internal affairs are to ensure the rights of the children.We are in an area in which the subsidiarity principle applies fully.The main responsibility for the determination of responsibilities towards the children is the responsibility of the Member States.As for the Union's responsibility as such, I believe that the rights of the children must be recognized in the Charter, whereby the areas must be taken into account in which the Union can provide an additional benefit for improving social, economic and in the broadest sense of the children.I hope we will be able to cope with this challenge in front of which the woman put the commission and the entire convention.Mr President, I had the honor of hearing the commission member talking about this topic several times today, and I can only agree with him.However, I want to ask a slightly different question.We have just heard from Mr. Barnier that he wants to improve communication with the citizens and to focus on the main topics with which the Commission will deal with this year.Would the Commissioner work to ensure that part of the Commission's information budget is provided for the information and hearing of the citizens on the subject of a Charter Charter?It is very important that the citizens feel involved in this process.I know that the convent itself will afford a lot in this area, but the same resources are not available here as with the Commission.Could the Commission imagine using part of its information budget to involve citizens in this debate?The Commission pursues a policy of open and comprehensive discussion about the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non -governmental organizations, but in view of the far -reaching character of this charter with all citizens.I can assure you that the Commission will do everything possible to boost the debate about a future basic right of fundamental rights.The best solution would be a clearly formulated text that is easy to understand by the citizens and at the same time can be used as a legal act.One does not exclude the other.The challenge is to design the final version of the charter in such a way that it meets both requirements.I am very happy that I can count on your support here.Inquiry No. 40 of (H-0095/00): concerns: Article 6 paragraph 1, Article 7 (1) and Article 7 (2) of the contract on the European Union in Article 6 (1) of the contract it says: ""The Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms as well as rule of law"".Jörg Haider and the FPÖ, this emerges from some of their statements in recent years, do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms, as far as nationals of third countries and Austria live in Austria."	de
It is limited to the exam only of the three topics that affect the structure and working method of only two organs of the European Union - and not even exhausting.Since they are known to everyone, I probably don't have to call them again.On the one hand, this determination is justified, on the one hand, in view of the demands that are repeatedly raised by European citizens and sometimes quite emphatically, as well as on the other hand due to the enormous dimensions of this huge undertaking, which the European Union has now undertaken with the expansion.In this respect, it cannot be concerned that questions that solution would ensure the smooth functioning of all and not only certain organs of the European Union would be excluded from the agenda of the government conference.Consideration must also be taken into account the topics that concern the citizens of Europe every day and with which they have to deal with.The European Parliament has clearly spoken out in many debates and in the reports submitted so far for the convening of the government conference.At the same time, however, I demand that there are also questions that the reform - I repeat it - improve and perfect it, as well as subject areas that directly affect and interest European citizens.This includes, for example, health, energy, culture, transport and tourism.On the one hand, it is not yet clear whether an expansion of the agenda will be enforced or not.At this point, let me really praise the political behavior of the Portuguese presidency, because it has repeatedly committed to the European Parliament to make the effort offered in this regard.On the other hand, the question of whether other points will be recorded may not reduce the meaning that every single member country of the government conference has to put on.The institutional framework for future Europe is a basic principle of European integration and therefore a question of the highest national importance for every Member State of the Union.Therefore, I request this high house, which Mr. Leinen and I have submitted to you so that the government conference can be opened on February 14 and our two representatives at this conference, Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatos, can go to the difficult work that you can expect there.The same applies to the European Commission, although I would like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his cooperation with the European Parliament and his extremely constructive suggestions.President!The faction of the European People's Party was not satisfied with the result of Helsinki's European Council.The agenda seemed too tight to us because our faction put itself in the logic of the contract and specifically in the protocol about the institutions of the Union.In Helsinki, the governments confirmed that a mini reform was sufficient as long as the European Union consisted of fewer than 21 states, while more members are required for a profound reform.The same European Council of Helsinki approved an expansion by 13 new Member States.Thus there is an incoherency between the opening of the accession negotiations with 13 countries and the desire for a mini reform.However, we continue to follow the logic of the contract and want the agenda of the next government conference to enable a deeper reform of the Union.	de
The suspect's Sid Ahmed Rezala is also suspected of being murdered by an English student Isabel Peaken, who was raped and thrown on track from the train to meet his parents, and the murder of another young woman Émilie Bazin. This was found dead in Amiens under the carbon pile, which was located in a building where the suspect was living. Rezala should never have been in France, he had come from Algeria at a time when the authorities said immigration had stopped and nothing justified his income. He should never have stayed in the country because the traffic police had given him more than 40 times the intentional violation. This should have been enough to expel his home country. He should never have been released because he had also been prosecuted against theft, violence and rape, one of which was a minor. He should never have been able to flee from France, but the pursuit-driven police had no arrest and the borders of Europe are leaking now like screening. She should never have ended up in Spain, where she threatened the woman with a knife to make money, but the Spanish authorities immediately let her free. Today, thanks to the complex network of perversions, he is in Portugal. Portugal has refused to surrender him on the grounds that he was threatened by a longer prison sentence in France than in Portugal's legislation. I point my words to the Portuguese minister, the chairman of the Council to terminate this scandal immediately. I show my words to our Parliament to finally realize the horrifying situation of victims of politicians, which the parties of this building take full responsibility, long before the thugs. Mr President, this agreement is about a sensitive topic: cooperation in criminal law. It is understandable that the Council has difficulty getting in agreement. Successful application of this Agreement in Member States requires consensus in the Council. Only the agreement with extensive support is important in practice. However, this does not mean that the Council should act anonymously in this context. On the contrary, the proposal of the Council shall fulfill the conditions for criminal law of national Member States. The desire to make an unanimous decision can lead to compromises that do not fulfill these conditions. Therefore, it is very important that the European Parliament, and in particular the national parliaments, are engaged in accurate parliamentary control. Di Pietro's presentation of the current Article 18 of Article 18, but also very far -reaching. The text of this Article 18 is vague: it restricts the operation of intelligence services, but shows that the Member State is intervened in the area of ​​another Member State without prior permission. In this way, the Member States become very vulnerable, and it is reasonable to doubt whether there are sufficient guarantees that the state in which the issue takes place and its citizens are protected. The proposed additions, such as repeated references to the European Convention on Human Rights, the rights of the defense and the accused, and the failure of the Member States in the implementation of the European Convention on Human Rights are too much in the text of the agreement. I admit the problems, but I think they could have been solved by a simple change in text. However, despite the suspicions, the Dutch members of the EDD group support the report of DI Pietro in the final vote. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, Good Parliament Members, is to deal with a report that is very important not only for its content, but also because it is the first step in creating more flexible relationships in the area of ​​legal cooperation. This has been dealt with only at the level of inter -state relationships, without clearly detecting signs of European citizenship from European citizens. On the one hand, legal action is foreign to the community level, and on the other hand, there is already free movement of people in Europe, which also benefits criminals. Now, under Article 29 of the Convention, the aim of the Union is to provide its citizens with a high level of protection in the area based on freedom, security and court by developing joint activities between Member States in police cooperation and legal cooperation in criminal matters, and by preventing and rejecting racism and alien hatred.	fi
The civil war is over in Cambodia and has relaxed the political situation, but the way the political opposition is now treated fulfills us with great concern.If it goes on like this, this must also have consequences for the relationships between the Union to Cambodia.President!In international law, a new doctrine currently prevails that no state may treat its citizens and the people living in his field as he wants, and state sovereignty is not an obstacle to an intervention from outside due to gross human rights violations, even if the government itself has been chosen legally or even democratically.Objection examples of this are the case of Pinochet-Ugarte, the Kosovo conflict and in a weakened form the debate on government formation in Austria in the Union's own ranks.The same danger now exists in Cambodia if it is not possible to legally responsible for the former leadership of the regime.At the same time, the fight against impunity, the impunity of those responsible, is endangered.This situation should also realize us that the ratification of the contract to establish an international criminal court is slow.President!We had an extremely useful debate about human rights yesterday.I am pleased that there was now an opportunity to illuminate a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - in which the protection of human rights is a particularly great challenge.First to Kosovo.The Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in the defense designs with regard to general politics towards Kosovo, with regard to the ongoing ethnic acts of violence and with regard to the prisoners in Serbian prison.Our efforts in Kosovo and the other region are aimed at short and medium-term recovery of the situation and long-term stabilization.In particular, we support the development of a free, democratic and multi -ethnic society.Our aid programs in the fields of democratization and human rights should be continued in order to create trust in general and in particular in order to create trust between the different communities as possible.We have always condemned ethnic violence, regardless of which ethnic group is perpetrator or victim.We consider them just as unacceptable to the minorities of the Serbs and Roma, as we have thought in the past to be unacceptable to the Kosovo Albanians.We support the efforts of the Unmik, the KFOR and OSCE to build up a functional civil administration and to ensure law and order.In this context, we are emphatically advocating the latest appeal from the high representative to the Member States to provide more police officers for the UN Civil Police Mission in Kosovo.This point was addressed in the pronunciation of several speakers.Hopefully this makes it clear that we have to devote ourselves to both the non-military and military aspects of this policy in developing a common foreign and security policy.We have to have clear objectives for our control activity and the establishment of institutions, but it is just as important that we have clear objectives for a military capacity.We are still very concerned about the fact that so many civilians are currently being recorded in the expectation of their procedure or after their conviction in Serbian prisons.	de
"This morning the helicopters were seven and of course these helicopters only operate in the Gaza area. The problems from the floods of the Save River are huge, but no one has yet to go there.85% of the missions were made one hour from Maputu, so we do not know the extent of the problem at all. I would also like to say, Commissioner, that European citizens want to know exactly what Echo is doing. Most of us here would not want to boast for 3 million euros. I believe we need much more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with these promises and also an initiative to coordinate some efforts there. Extensive air transport must also be carried out. As you said, tons of food, water disinfection equipment, scenes, blankets. We are really prepared for the next stage of helping and rehabilitation, which you mentioned, because this will require huge resources. Are we ready to pay for these resources? Mozambique, of course, is one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of the successful cases of Africa with the work it has done in terms of economic growth, reduction in poverty, democracy despite the enormous pressure on debt. Mozambique is a wonderful example, but now it is likely that it will suffer enormous difficulties due to what it has endured. What we need to consider now is to the negative degree this disaster will regain Mozambique. This depends on the quality and quantity of the international aid to be granted for this affected country. Thank you very much, Mrs. Kinnock. Mr Nogueira, I have to tell you that we take into account your interest and concern on this issue, but your team has not registered to speak, and I will keep the regulation. The discussion ended. The Economy of the Union (1999) The Daily provision provides for the discussion of the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr. Katoforis, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Policy Committee, on the European Commission document: ""The Economy of the Union: Overview 1999"" (C5-0081/2000-2000/2046 (COS))., rapporteur.(In) the Commission report presents a review of the current state of the European economy, which it considers very promising, mainly in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth, which is expected to lead to a reduction in unemployment to 8% by 2001.annually during the 1990s, despite the emergence of higher growth rates over the same decade, which we were not able to consolidate. It follows that if we do not want the same mistakes of the past to happen again, we must use the current window of opportunity with improved economic performance in order to launch a new transition policy to higher sustainable levels of growth in our economy. This is the challenge. In the face of this challenge, the Commission is essentially our economic policy to simply extend our previous stance, which is limited to the proper regulation of the monetary and budgetary bases of the economy, while in terms of the rest, the belief that markets will do their miracle without further intervention by conscientious intervention."	el
"While sitting here, hundreds of thousands of people are at risk of floods in Mozambique. This is not something that emerged a while ago. Floods have been happening for weeks, however, it just seems that there is an assessment of needs. The level of practical assistance from the community and the Member States was deplorable. For a long time now, many of us have been warning that the European Union has excessively paid a lot of time in the potentially harmful and essentially political plan for the establishment of military decision -making structures, while it should have focused its efforts on improving its political media. I recognize Mr Patten's efforts in this direction, but it is a shame that the governments of the Member States have devoted so much time, not to clarify their potential about the help of disasters and humanitarian aid, but to the dangerous venture of creating military structures. Of course, there is a relationship between military resources and humanitarian aid, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries. These are chronic, but they are already treated in the context of NATO. I have not yet heard a convincing explanation for security policy, why the European Union needs to establish autonomous opportunities for decision -making for the use of military forces outside NATO structures unless NATO competes. After all, EU Member States are either full members of NATO or participate in the Euro -Atlantic Cooperation Council. NATO is largely a European scheme. Finally, Mr Solana, I would just like to ask you what the meaning of the much -publicized policy planning and early warning unit at the Council Secretariat, if we are still surprised by another humanitarian disaster. Mr President, Mr Sir, Mr Commissioner, Mr Commissioner for the war in Chechnya, we all highlighted the highly restrained and almost sympathetic reaction of the international community in general and the European Union in particular. However, what happened and still in Chechnya is like genocide. How else should one characterize the full extermination of a regional capital of 400,000 inhabitants, the uninterrupted and excessive bombing of sites, villages, neighborhoods, where the entire civilian population was among the few Chechen fighters? How should you characterize the miserable filtering camps, which could be likened to concentration camps, in which the population is subject to the worst humiliation and where healthy men from 15 to 65 are rarely coming alive? How to characterize the rape, looting, arson, displacements called cleansing, reminiscent of the worst events of the European Middle Ages? And what about the black veil that covers the Russians and international journalists on the one hand and the removal of humanitarian organizations, as well as any International Research Committee from the fields of slaughter? If this is the ""real politik"", if we in fact do not have strong means, then, Mr. Sir, we are a representative of the KEPPA, Mr. Commissioner - I address both of you - let us at least use the means we have, that is, the strengthening programs for Russia."	el
What we need to understand is that once we live in an enlarged community space, no situation in any country in the field of democratic rights leaves no other countries and their citizens indifferent. We are all European citizens, and we are all citizens of a Europe who is inspired, at a political level, by a fundamental set of principles. If these authorities are undermined, we have every right and the debt to be an alarm. Now, as for lists of desired or unwanted parties, let's hope that this will never exist within the European Union. Yes, but the problem is exactly that we are talking about this. Because Austria has a prefect in Klagenfurt expressed in a way that you and I hate equally, so you have punished a sanctions country and punish a people with sanctions, including those who have voted against that party, without specifying exactly where. So far you only punish opinions not acts. If it were punishment of acts then Denmark may be punished for the ban on the entry of immigrants that the liberal Austrian party did not apply. In other words, you punish opinions and not acts. So I would like to know the next time I will vote if Portugal and other countries - except the Council - will propose sanctions against my country if for example the present government assign ministries to MPs from the People's Socialist Party or the List of Unity,of the Left, if it is based on an agreement with the Danish People's Party which in many newspapers is described as a party corresponding to the Austrian Liberal Party. This information would be useful for consumers. But of course, the 14 leaders of the governments may regret their act. The main MP is probably aware of what was highlighted in previous answers: In this case of Austria, which I knew you were implying with the question you asked, we are not moving at the Community level but in the context of a process that is related to bilateral relations. The attitude they have chosen to take some Member States towards the Austrian government stems from their negative assessment of the character of the new Austrian government, which does not affect the events at the Community level. In this case we are not moving within the Council. The European Union has not decided to implement any measures that involve adverse distinction against Austria. Imly and seamlessly, the fourteen Member States decided to express their dissatisfaction with the Austrian authorities for the government's format to form, and in particular that they have allowed the government to participate in a party that is being embraced,-, a specific ideology and a peculiar form of interpretation of European values.	el
For this reason, the Group for Europe of Nations did not support the amendments that cannot be implemented in our states and which their economic consequences may prove to be extremely harmful. As for the rest, and as a local representative, I hope that a collapse and simplification of the Community directives will make the regulatory framework in which the waste management plans are integrated into a clearer and more consistent. The approval of this Waste Intelligence Directive, which will be implemented in 2005, greatly improves the existing framework for waste management in Europe, introducing particularly important criteria, such as those linked to public health and the protection of citizens' rights. On the other hand, if the directive in question came into force immediately, which unfortunately would only happen in 2005, it would be almost impossible for the Portuguese government to promote the following strategic strategy. In any case, in the case of a directive that imposes significant restrictions, from a technical, legal and procedural point of view, throughout the incineration and co -operation processes applied in Europe, it will make it even more apparent that the strategy followed in Portugal is extremely incorrect. So, although my desire was to be able to impose further restrictions on the processes of incineration and co -operation, I can only express my satisfaction with the results achieved, since this Directive: 1 - establishes more stricter marginalize emissions, in particular.2 - Equipment, in terms of determination of marginal prices, incineration and co -operation installations, putting an end to the exemption regime enjoyed by the latter.3 - estimates, leaving no room for doubts, that the appeal to cremation and co -operation should only be used as a ultimate solution, since all other technical methods are tested.4 - establishes strict conditions for total waste management, location and size of incineration and co -operation facilities, which must be met before any license is granted.5 - Enhances the interventional capacity of the competent authorities in the event of a possible non -compliance of the installations for the marginal values.6 - drastically reduces the likelihood of reuse of waste from the processes of incineration and co -operation, especially for construction work.7 - Establles the continuous sampling for the detection of dioxins as a compulsory process in the creation of incineration and co -operation.8 - Increases the level of participation of citizens in decision -making processes on facilities.9 - Ensures the obligation to submit an annual environmental report, which will assure that the marginal emissions are respected.10 - It significantly reduces the exceptions that apply to facilities where cement -fired facilities operate.11 - For the first time determines a marginal value for ammonia emissions (NH3), given the acutes of the ambient air caused by the particular chemical compound..(FR) The proposal for the incineration of waste is a complex technical issue, the environmental and financial impact of which must be weighted with care. At the end of the first reading, the European Parliament had largely left its mark on the discussions, proposing the merger of the two instructions on the cremation of domestic and dangerous waste. Today, I believe that the common position presented by the Council is a very good compromise that I am able to subscribe. However, I would like to refer to a particular point, that of condensation in cement -fired and justify my negative vote on the two amendments.	el
In my opinion, in fact it is not too ambitious, if we receive as a starting point that we have to wait in 2020 in order not to channel water pollutants, and until then we will strive to achieve levels close to zero to pollutants and poisonous substances. The point is, of course, that we will do what is technically possible, there is no matter of course, but we must be quite ambitious. I want to point out a topic about which it was mentioned earlier. In my opinion, the Environment Committee has limited the issue of water transport with excessive rigor. This problem is not only Spain's problem, it is also a problem for the Scandinavian countries, and I really hope in these issues we will trust national solutions when they are better for the environment and the economy than those now presented in the directive. Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, Congratulations Mrs. Lienemann for your wonderful work. Water and air are everywhere around us. We share them with all people on earth. Water is a prerequisite for the existence of human life and, in this life, we live more and more. Earlier today, Mr Schleicher implied the expectation of having clean water is unrealistic. This is absolutely incorrect. What is not realistic is the gradual deterioration of water quality, the gradual deterioration of the conditions of life. Particularly unrealistic is for agriculture, which depends more on anything else on pure nature and pure resources. For this reason, I would like to appeal to Parliament MPs to realize that the establishment of strict conditions for the environment is a pure environment is the most realistic perspective in the long run. Mr President, we argue, and I personally support Mrs Lienemann's report and the goals he sets and the directive we are considering. However we had to look at some points a little more. For example, in my country, Mr President, a huge problem is rivers and waters of waters from pseudo -development arguments and with great dangers of course for underground waters, aquifers and surface waters. That is why, and I think, whether we finally conclude who decides to make such diversions, the specifications that are common to all of us should be very strong. However, the Great Issue, Mrs. Commissioner, is, in my opinion, planning the restoration of aquifers and the natural flow of rivers and natural lakes, which must be done in the ten years we have planned. And I think such projects should also be eligible so that they can be funded, because at the bottom this rehabilitation can prove to be an excellent development policy. Mr President, in basic lines we have good arrangements before us. They set feasible standards based on the principle of auxiliary and the management of river basins. Their goals for good quality drinking water and good quality water for fauna, as well as their environmental and economic aspirations are going in the right direction. Preventing the infection and deterioration of water condition should be appropriate as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and floods.	el
In this case, action is required and the example must be shown from above. Mr President Prodi, the Commission's reform, is not only to protect the financial interests of the community. So much more resources are lost due to ineffective and poorly motivated administration. In addition, it should even be accepted that those officials can be mistaken who take responsibility and take the risk. You said in your speech that you would rather be mistaken, but that you would not leave the action. Forward, Mr President Prodi. The task you have adopted should be historical in nature. You are not the first entrepreneur. Let us hope you succeed in it. Mr President, it is interesting that the chairman Prodi has presented a work program today;However, our agenda reads that we are going to discuss the legislative program. If we look at the program from a social and employment policy perspective, it is clear that there is no legislative program in our hands. Nowadays, we have not actually had a legislative program for many years. Instead, we have had a reinforcement process and the development of certain approximation processes, such as the process developed and launched in Luxembourg. We are positive about Luxembourg's procedure. We hope that it will be deepened, strengthened and expanded to other areas, such as social security. However, does this mean that we have been done in the social field for legislation? Hardly. There are many areas where we need to upgrade and modernize the social legislation we have previously approved. As the internal market and global growth deepen and strengthen, we find that more and more mergers, invasions and transitions are underway in the European Union. In my opinion, this means that we need to go through the entire 1970s, mainly in this field, the legislative framework we developed in this field, which are about transfers, workers' mass transfer, insolvency and finally business councils. We need to modernize and strengthen the legislation in this field, not to stop the deepening of global or internal markets, of course, but to ensure that we are able to control the changes brought about in the European Union for everyone, both of our large and small workplaces, thanks to the common spirit. This means that we must vigorously strive for the general framework for knowledge and consultation in the workplace. There is also a need to upgrade and modernize the legislation we have previously approved in the health and security: a Directive for pregnant workers, which is five years late;Melud Directive from 1986 with a review of 10 years late;Many Directives should be thoroughly needed and modernized. However, is it just a topical issue? No. We do not need any new amount of social legislation, but there are areas that have not been taken into account. Our promises have not been redeemed in the field of homework or teleworking legislation;We have a gaping gap for atypical work in social security, as it has been in the process of almost a decade;We have a promise without redeeming a special directive for muscle injuries and bone injuries, which has been untreated since the previous medium -term social sector action program. There are other areas. One woman named Angela Elliot Mathis, who works for Lucent Technologies, recently visited me. He was captured as a leading manager to the company and a member of the board of directors. He had worked in high -tech companies in several European countries. After being at work for 13 months, he was dismissed without dismissal time and for no reason. It is noteworthy that he did not have security in Belgian law he worked in Belgium or under the law of the Union. If people do not have such security, they will not be taken to the opportunity they offered to the event or work anywhere in the European Union or anywhere in the European Union. We need to correct these shortcomings. Let us do it in the new medium -term social field. Mr President, I would like to emphasize the areas of the work program that have a direct impact on the work of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee.	fi
The time for questions to the Commission is closed.(The session, suspended at 7:30 p.m., is resumed at 9 p.m.) Community policy in the water field (continued) The agenda calls for the rest of the debate on the recommendation for the second reading relating to community policy in the field of water.Mr. President, the situation of soft waters in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and quality, to decrease.To this must be added the problems of water pollution that strike the possible new member states of the East.Didn't a tank containing cyanide have just broken in Romania, threatening the aquifers who supply the population of Yugoslavia?I understood that Ms. Wallström, that I thank very much for her presence this evening, will go to the region.I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can deny the need for this directive to put an end to the fragmentation currently characterizing water policy and facilitate the start of a program of measures specific to each hydrographic basin.Gestation was difficult and complex, the interests at stake are multiple and the opinions, shared.I have no doubt that the rapporteur in this legislature, Ms. Lienemann, has made a big effort and a lot of time to reconcile and reconcile the positions and she has largely succeeded.Nevertheless, knowing and correctly assessing all situations and perspectives is an almost impossible task.I come from a country, half of which looks at the Mediterranean and where the availability of water historically responds to the whims of a changing climate and a difficult configuration of the terrain.The Mediterranean region had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity century after century, year after year and day after day until today.This is why the practical application made by the directive of the obligation, taken up in article 164 of the treaty, according to which community legislation must take into account the diversity of its regions, seems essential to us.Precisely in application of this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party will oppose amendments 4 (considering 21), 13 and 49 (article 11, letter D) because they imply a serious limitation in a field of exclusive management of Member States such as the regulation of their water resources.The community could very difficult to determine the conditions of its regulations in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always at stake and which in any case require an in -depth knowledge of the different areas and interests concerned.Similarly, we reject the amendments which aim to include the total cost of water for 2010. We must undoubtedly set water prices which encourage its effective use but which, at the same time, allow to maintain the competitiveness of the production sectors in the most disadvantaged regions and which do not prevent their legitimate development.	fr
"The report does not adhere to what its title promises. Madam President, thank Mr. Haarder for his truly excellent work. However, there is a point where I have to say that I disagree with the rapporteur. When I read the Danish edition of Mr. Haarder's report, I believed for a moment that Mr. Haarder has become wiser over the years and took into account that there is now a decision of the Danish Supreme Court which determines that the so -called ""binding contracts"" do not conflict human rights. I believed and hoped that I could express my agreement with Mr. Haarder by highlighting each person's right to decide whether to become a member of a trade union. But when I read the exposure to other languages ​​I saw that Mr. Haarder did not become wiser or otherwise it was just hiding it well. In some vague formalities, the rapporteur seems to continue his crusade against the Danish model, according to which employers and employees can agree that only members of a particular trade union can be employed in a particular business. No one lacks the right to work, no one lacks the right to register with a trade union, but each individual cannot benefit from extensive social conventions without being the same member of the particular trade union who concluded these contracts. Mr. Haarder launches his attack more vigor because he indirectly attempts to strengthen the trade unions that do not recognize the collective struggles that have contributed to the creation of prosperity and human rights, which we spent the whole day discussing. Madam President, I see that you did not invite Mr Hernandez Mollar and he has left me his intervention to speak on his behalf. Therefore, I would ask you, Mrs. President, to give me the two minutes of Mr. Hernandez Mollar so that I can present his intervention and then the four minutes for mine if you have no objection. So I am presenting the intervention of Mr. Hernandez Mollar. Ladies and gentlemen, Mrs. President, the debate on xenophobia and racism is a debate with great social and political depth. The Ludford report includes particularly acceptable points that can and should validate every Democrat, but also has others that transcend the strict political even legal concept. European citizenship is an abstract concept that has no legal status. Member States are regulating their citizens' political rights in accordance with their own democratic laws, as is the case in many countries of origin of citizens who migrate to European territories. By calling for political participation in local, national or European elections or even access to the public sector of those who do not have nationality of the Member States without the establishment of this principle of reciprocity, goes beyond political realism and legal accuracy. A proposal in this sense is impossible to make it, and for this reason, I ask Ms Ludford to withdraw her in order to vote in favor of her report."	el
"While restructuring to improve competitiveness and conquering market shares from an economic aspects are commendable, such a measure can be reduced if, at the request of the financiers, who are often the only shallow holder, they are the only purpose of increasing the asset of these companies in order to be able to achieve greater profits.The different announcements of my colleagues in recent times, be it on the part of Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this regard.In my opinion, rationalization of management and better results must primarily serve the company and therefore its employees, although there may also be financial effects.Today, a process of corporate mergers and mergers as well as relocation of production with their known effects on product quality as well as with the human level, especially for the family as a core cell of society, dramatic social effects, in particular unemployment, difficult working conditions and greater flexibility.So there is a great risk of a division of our planet: On the one hand, the poor countries that provide workers and on the other the rich countries that procure capital.Doesn't Europe have to offer protection to maintain a certain balance between higher profitability and social well -being?We should not forget that the human capital presents the basis for the operation of a company that ensures good results.Finally, I would like to point out that the third letter means ""difference"" in the name of the group that I belong.Europe has the task of raising its voice as an alternative to the exclusively profit -oriented restructuring, which are not subject to rules, which points in this uniform current of restructuring in a different direction.President!In one of my neighboring regions, the Michelin Group announced extensive layoffs in their work in Stoke-on-Trent last month due to the restructuring of the company and increasing global competitive pressure on the world market for mature.Like all of the MPs present, this loss at workplaces is saddened by me.I also saddle the announcement by Goodyear, which gave the occasion for this resolution.However, I very much doubt whether a European works council would have been able to change the decision of this company.This high house is really very good in writing resolutions and laws, and sometimes we forget in this institution that Europe alone cannot survive.We need multinational companies that have their business basis on our continent.After the few months I am here, I find it astonishing that we all talk about the need to promote corporate growth in the EU, but with almost all of our resolutions, the companies actually cause the companies to leave.At our last plenary conference in Brussels, we voted on the Altakuto Directive and brought about a retrospective law that has huge additional costs for the European motor vehicle manufacturers that they could not foreseen.Two days later, Toyota said that with several thousand employees in my region, this guideline would not only increase the costs of cars, but could also mean layoffs for his work in derbyshire.In a world in which there is certainly less regulation, we apparently believe in this house that we can expect more regulation and more costs to the companies and that, without the temptation of other locations, they will remain in the European Union."	de
"Member Swoboda said we had to make our citizens feel at home, and I agree with him. We have common values ​​in this matter, and everyone has their job and responsibilities in this matter. This is probably the question of the norms mentioned by Van Dam, namely the principle of subsidiarity. All levels of politics require clear responsibility, and politics must be partners and not as competitors. Power must be used as close as possible to the citizens, so that it can be used as openly as possible and allows the citizens themselves to monitor it. This requires a new political culture, not only at the words but also in a practical level, taking into account the reality of the Member States and the regions. Areas are sometimes as important in cultural and economic terms as certain Member States. New Europe should not only develop in width but also in depth, so that our values ​​are understood in practice and that a democratically real community is being built. On this basis, the Commission is evaluated. The Mr President, the Commission today, will present its strategic goals in the form of an extremely general document that has been smoothed to avoid any insults for anyone's opinions in the form of an extremely general document. Thus, the first part of the book, which deals with the new way of directing European affairs, is, of course, no mention of federalism or federal state. However, it is precisely these when it comes to strong European institutions that decentralize decision -making only on general implementation issues and promote their collective views in a confused entity where national governments and parliamentary are confused with regional and even local authorities and civic societies. ""These ambiguities hide many misunderstandings that are first associated with our values. In fact, appeal to democracy does not make a person a democrat yet. Being a democrat, especially and concretely, requires that citizens free to make their decision at a level where the neutral conditions of the nearby, honest and open democratic debate are best met, mainly at national level. However, the entire communication of the Commission has been built on the opposite principle, which states that the independent choice of peoples' independent choice should be constantly limited by new regulations, new policies, or new binding legal structures, such as a very wrong proposal called. I emphasize the words ""very wrong"" because it actually reduces these rights. The Nations Europe group supports quite different principles. We want to defend European countries but also respect the choices of peoples. This is not about the square of the circle. Indeed, we have to get rid of the obsolete federalist plans made by the people whose thoughts on Europe are from Jean Monnet's reminiscences. Instead, the Union's institutions must be opened to the modern world by inventing the dynamics of varying geometry in which nations are respected. The Mr Commission Chairman, the significant idea of ​​the new way of guidance in European matters, that we would have liked to find in your communication. Unfortunately, it wasn't there. The Mr President, the Mr President of the Commission, you claim to outline the new Europe, but unfortunately you lack one of the essential prerequisites: trust. It is not possible to gain confidence in millions of Europeans when the person concerned is not worthy of this trust. And how could you be worthy of trust after a crazy cow crisis or a resignation of the Corruption of the Santer Commission? You are responsible for millions of unemployed and millions of poor, uncertainty and misery, which is enhanced by your extreme market and extremist policies and forcing your uniform currency. You wanted to destroy the internal borders, thus leaving Europe exposed to the explosive growth of crime and insecurity and uncontrolled migration. You are now proposing all decision -making power to a handful of officials by making states, local authorities and NGOs, which, moreover, have all been subdivided equally to Brussels alone."	fi
We have developed parks everywhere, which constitute a key element of the Life program.The fact remains that these parks, made with few financial means, without signaling, have no effect and are useless.This is why I invite Parliament and the Commission to give this question all the attention it deserves.Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions regarding the proposed regulations concerning a third stage for the instrument for the environment - Life.I would like to congratulate the Environment Commission and Ms. Lienemann for the excellent and constructive collaboration that we had in this area.Thanks to this, I can confirm that the Commission can accept in full or in their nine principle of the fourteen amendments that have been adopted by the Environment Commission.The Commission approves above all the amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 13, relating to the comitology procedures.Parliament has, in this case, fully taken into account the objections of the Commission against the common position.The Commission may also approve in principle amendment 4, which must however be introduced in another way into the text.With regard to amendments 5 and 6, I would like to emphasize that the project for a sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, as well as the project to limit air pollutants which contribute to the greenhouse effect are largely taken up by Life.However, the Commission considers that mentioning this apart goes against the initial decision to center the proposal on some priority points.There is also a risk of overlap with other community programs such as the fifth framework program for research, technological development and demonstration actions.The key measures of this program - the quality of the water, the city of tomorrow and the innovative products and processes - partly use the same subjects.As for the budget, I am delighted with the confidence shown by the Environment Commission.Amendment 12 offers a larger budget than that set in the common position.I am also convinced that Life has enormous potential.This instrument could finance good projects with credits higher than those mentioned in the budget proposal.The amount fixed in amendment 12, however, does not comply with the budgetary plan established on the basis of the 2000 agenda. Allow me to add that if we increase the budget it is obvious that we will also require the environment directorate that it deals with a growing number of projects.It is also necessary to take into account other programs, for which decisions must be made within the framework of the CODECISION procedure.The Commission sticks, in this stage, to the amount fixed in the common position.With regard to amendment 3, which we did not adopt during the first reading, I would like to emphasize that each program has its own objectives, eligible costs and requests.	fr
This applies to the minimum rights stipulated in the contract, to ensure the free movement of the workforce - while maintaining social rights - this also applies to economic coordination and economic cooperation.So we need coordination and cooperation, but convergence for the objectives not to strive for the funds.I would also like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Jan Andersson, for his very constructive efforts to compensate for different opinions and support his report.I myself can support the report, but I am critical of individual points.I support z.For example, it is not the requirement that the Commission should do something against the so-called unfair competition between social and tax systems if such an intervention is to be used to brake innovative thinking, development and effective design of our social systems or to prevent the reduction of too high tax burdens in many EU countries.I reject detailed provisions of the Commission on the scope and quality of child or elderly care and are skeptical about the determination of a value for a common poverty limit.The coordination of social policy and dialogue is good.However, we should not all treat them according to the same pattern, but there must be space for a variety of solutions.President, Ms. Commissioner!I would like to make some positive comments on the modernization of social protection presented here, but also indicate problem areas.I find it welcomed that it is slowly but surely moving to this dossier.I think that is right and useful.I am also positively set to the guidelines of the message, the strategy.Hopefully the four goals shown in it can then be achieved properly.In addition, we would like to underline how important the way we tackle the problem is on the one hand the trial à la Luxemburg.However, we also need, for example, and Ms. Van Lancker has already pointed out that, guidelines for atypical work, for self -employed without employees, etc. However, two problems for which we have to find solutions are likely to arise.First, there is a lowering of the social protection level, where we hope for convergence at a level.Let me give me some examples from an investigation that the Dutch unions recently carried out on the effects of reforms in the European Union on social protection.According to this study, alignment occurs everywhere.Numerous, even most of the equations, are obviously directed downwards, the rest are improvements.Most adjustments relate to pensions, eleven restrictions and two improvements.In unemployment benefit, we find six deterioration and five improvements.The equations are, for example, to the promotion of employment, reduction in social expenditure, but also to the competition and the WWU criteria.This political competition can be found primarily in the northern countries.We observe the safest social protection and even improvements in the southern countries.Summa Summarum is also likely to decrease the influence of the social partners in this entire process.This is not true, and therefore the convergence strategy should be based on the best approaches.Cappuccino, to put it this way, don't always meet us for the benefit.President!Now I would like to congratulate the commission and the rapporteur.The commission because it took a further step towards the approach of social protection, the rapporteur because he provided an excellent report.	de
Social integration, which requires a firm commitment in economic, political and social terms on the part of the responsible authorities, is the only way to prevent these events from happening again where there are already important communities of immigrant workers.We are all immigrants.For generations, the human being has not always stayed inside the borders of a nation state.There have constantly had migratory flows.Geographic mobility is not an invention of the 20th century, nor their economic and work reasons.We are all immigrants, whether personally or by a member of our family or one of our ancestors.However, instead of being at the origin of events that we condemn here, these migratory flows must be generating social, cultural and economic enrichment.We believe that what has happened to El Ejido, which is unfortunately not the exclusivity of this locality of the European Union, requires, first of all, the clear and clear conviction of the brutal racist and xenophobic explosion of certain residents of El Ejido against the immigrant workers in the region, empowering, criminalizing and aggressing a whole community for an isolated fact.Second, this requires immediate action of all administrations;Coordination between them is essential in order to fight this type of xenophobic and racist acts.More concretely, the local authorities, the mayors, have a direct responsibility in the prevention of any racist or xenophobic demonstration, all the more so when it implies violent events against people and their property.These authorities also have the obligation to promote difficult agreements between the parties present and not to prevent them, as is the case of the mayor of El Ejido.Thirdly, this requires that political parties assume a direct responsibility in the political exercise of their public functions and prevent any act or declaration of an individual nature contrary to the principles and values ​​of cohabitation and tolerance expressed by the European Union.Finally, this requires from the European Union a responsibility for monitoring the application of its principles, preserving its territory from any racist or xenophobic manifestation, its support and collaboration with the rest of the national, regional and local administrations as well as with associations and non -governmental organizations in the application of these principles as well as in the context of a continuous action to combat racism and xenophobia and in favorof the integration of all immigrants residing in the territory of the European Union.Mr. President, at first, our group did not see the need to present this proposal because it seemed to act of a local phenomenon.However, the events of El Ejido constitute a symptom of a phenomenon which crosses all of Europe and which deserves the greatest attention.We thought we were getting rid of the horror of intolerance that racism had unleashed in Europe, but as the years spend why not say so social degradation in our Europe is combined with the increase in migratory flows from the countries around us and a greater awareness of human rights, and this climate of racism and intolerance increases.This is why what seemed to be a local phenomenon - to El Ejido- becomes a worrying symptom which coincides with the rise of parties like that of Haider.This is the reason why we propose, from the European Parliament, the adoption of urgent measures which attack all the factors involved and which are of immediate application: respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism, the increase in budgets and action lines in social and health matters.	fr
If, among other things, as the Portuguese Presidency program points out, the Commission could promote a new stage in the social dialogue, which would focus on an agreed strategy of socialization and dissemination of knowledge, that is, a strategy of employment and defining its rules, this would allow it to be able to do so.restructuring and restructuring. Thirdly, I do not believe that for the European Union, the reduction of the number of workers due to the aging of the population is inevitably fatal, not only because of the existence of margins to increase women's employment and because of immigration, but also because the widespread and pervasive reversal of the wakeSocial protection, not, of course, to a significant reduction in future pension benefits, but to the active exploitation of increasing expectation of life to prolong professional life. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you are appearing, Mr Prodi, as a warm fan of reform and very ambitious. Welcome to both you and your ambition, which will need to be in the face of the huge work she is waiting for. However, in order for all these reforms to be made, in order to make progress in the 2001 parliamentary program, it needs great confidence not only for these forces themselves, but also on the views of the rest. You say you will not hesitate to come to this parliament and request more resources for the committee. But the Commission must be deeply aware of our close fiscal margins. We have 1.27% of Community GDP: not a euro above, not one euro less. We will not be the ones who will deny new resources, you should probably contact the Council. These fiscal prospects are calculated in the millimeter. To finance your Plan for the Balkans you need to negotiate a major revision of Class 4, and you will remember the enormous difficulties we have encountered to approve the budget of 2000. I remind you that in this political group, the European People's Party and the European Democrats, the European People's Party and the European Democrats. Political priorities must be highlighted by parliament and MEPs. Don't even believe that the reform of the budget you propose will conceal the restrictions of the Community financial system. It is advisable to pay, in a spirit of consensus, an effort to rationalize, but to know well that the deficiency of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor budget execution are still the emergency issues that need to be resolved. Therefore, we ask the question of whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Dear Cathers, Dear colleagues, the document on strategic goals presents in my view two clear weaknesses. The preparation of a new economic and social agenda helps nothing when no one has exhausted the potential of the old.	el
It requires climate -friendly energy, nuclear power. The Mr President, on behalf of the PSE group, I find it positive that we have made a decision in the mediation procedure for the Altener II program. However, I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Langen, for the very good work he did in this report. I would also like to thank the chairman of the Mediation Committee delegation, the colleague Provan. Because as a member Langen already said, the Mediation Committee was a really tough struggle. However, we can now say that the handwriting of the European Parliament is also very clearly reflected in the outcome of the mediation procedure. Member Langen suggested that the conciliation procedure accepted numerous content and demands of Parliament, and the most important issue that Parliament disagreed with the Council, that is, this multi -year program, which aims to promote renewable energy sources in the Community, we may have been with the Council. It's not satisfactory, I want to say very clearly. However, we accepted this compromise because it was important to us that this program can now be started quickly. It is due to double the share of renewable energy sources to at least 12 % over the next few years. It is a declared objective of the European Union. In this context, the Altener program is indeed a key to the only EU program, the exclusive goal of which is to promote renewable energy sources. First of all, this new five -year program must expand the action of the Altener I program. It includes, among other things, the deepening of the exchange of information and experience between renewable energy sources, the development of local and regional energy organizations, and the construction of new networks and support for existing ones. These are just a few examples. However, the Altener II program is particularly important - in my opinion - new measures to facilitate the access of renewable energy sources and implement, monitor and monitor the community strategy and community action plan. We are now available for a document for the start -up campaign for the Commission, which is an integral part of this community strategy. It designs the promotion of all the essential areas of all renewable energy sources. This Altener program must indeed be sympathetic and supported by this campaign. The total investment costs of this campaign are estimated to be approximately EUR 30 billion.75 - 80 % of this amount is expected to come from private sources of funding, plus the public funds of the Member States and the regions. In this respect, the Altener program can indeed provide important new impetus for investments, facilitate investment and help us indeed achieve our goal in the spirit of environmental protection, economy and new jobs. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, I also want to thank Mr. Langen for his good work on this important topic. The result of the mediation on the Altener program presented by the Mediation Committee is at least satisfactory after the difficult steps. Most of the reviews of the Parliament have been taken into account and a positive issue is to increase the amount of the program to EUR 77 million. The Union has ambitious goals to increase the use of renewable energy. However, the budget is very low in relation to these goals. It must be used for pilot projects, research, exchange of information and also making attitudes positive for renewable energy. The main responsibility for increasing the use of renewable energy sources is on the shoulders of Member States. Hopefully, this program will make Member States operate decisively to increase renewable energy. But in the future, the Union will also need to increase its own contribution to promote renewable energy and ensure that renewable energy is unexpectedly marketed. Promoting renewable energy is particularly important for the environment. The Union cannot achieve its environmental goals unless the use of renewable energy sources is actively increased. Renewable energy sources reduce the dependence on import energy and increase their use improves competitiveness. Europe can also reach a lead in the industry, which supplies the equipment needed for renewable energy. It should also be remembered that the use of renewable energy sources has a positive impact on regional development and employment.	fi
"You have received a letter of appeal from the number of errors in this report and other recent reports. One error has still not been corrected and it is about checking 4.

In this spirit, I feel grateful that the Commission, namely Commissioner Patten, but also Vice President Palacio with whom I was recently in Budapest, are considering how traffic can be restored to the Danube - let me mention this, as long as I come from a country.which of course would also be important for Romania. It is my opinion that this regional approach is the right way, if properly understood, that is, as a method that contributes to the economic recovery of the region itself. It should not, as we have said, be perceived as coercion, nor defined as a prerequisite. Secondly, I want to say clearly that we want to propose FYROM/Macedonia to follow the road leading to the EU and we also want this road to be open. We find it unrealistic that a request would be deliberate today, but we find it equally wrong in the view that this will be discussed at some point in the future. FYROM/Macedonia wants to hear today that it will have this opportunity in principle when it is ready. The country is worried that we are somehow put it on waiting. He believes that the whole remodeling of the aid means enhances the risk that it is no longer the last wagon of the train directed to Europe, but a wagon that enters the train station, while the train continues its course to Europe. But I think that Commissioner Patten has an understanding and so I would like to warmly clarify this point in similar conversations. Thirdly, I believe that FYROM/Macedonia has proven - at least to date - that it is able to handle the media properly. Even if there are changes here, which is natural, FYROM/Macedonia will continue to prove that future things that are still being carried out in Brussels will be able to be done in Skopje in the country itself. I hope that colleagues will be able to consent to the approval of these amendments as a sample of goodwill against FYROM/Macedonia. Nl) Mr President, from the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I am sorry but I prefer this shorter name - play a constructive role in ensuring peace. I remind the body the proposals of the governments of Macedonia and the then Bosnian Erzegovina, which aimed to relax the federal structure of the former Yugoslavia. Consequently, our friends in Macedonia have always played a very positive role, and therefore it must be told in the body that this country is not simply the subject of the so -called stabilization effort we make, but that it is essentially the source of this effort. This must be recorded in the former president of the former president, Mr. Gligorov, while the current president has been very highly promoted as the leader of the people of that country. So I believe that the European Union should feel lucky with such an interlocutor in the Balkans. Despite the obvious reasons for any internal tensions, the two population groups have managed to find a modus vivendi, while further prospects for solving the remaining problems are favorable.	el
The benefit of this new legislation is in the creation of a particular legal basis to combat the scraps. I am especially pleased with this because it is one of our most important requirements in our monitoring report caused by crazy cow's disease. In my opinion, for the sake of consistency, it would also be necessary to integrate the existing SKRAPIA legislation limited to the trade of sheep and goats into one of the all-covered regulations, which would regulate BSE-type diseases in the entire European Union throughout the European Union. Such legislation has been needed, especially because Skrapie is still in uncertainty. There are also scientific hypotheses that Skrapie might have developed into the BSE of cattle and thus would be an early form of episotic BSE. Although the proposal for the European Parliament and the Council's prevention and control of certain BSE diseases will require refinement and strengthening, especially in the case of the detection and control of the Skrans, the proposal implies significant improvement. It is a guarantee for European citizens, as they have shown several times that they are concerned about the Union's food policy. Their concern has been heard through the European Parliament. Discussions on pre -preparedness principle, traceability, responsibility and transparency have led the European Commission to present a white book on food safety. This white book provides a variety of reflection and proposes the establishment of an independent food authority in the Union. All of this is about a Union strategy to restore consumer confidence. We, the union responsible persons, must be shown that the uniform market and free movement of goods can be coordinated with food safety! Cederschiöld's recommendation (A5-0008/2000) Mr President, I voted for this measure concerning the reform of copyright legislation, as I think it is one of the most important sectors in which the European Parliament is highlighted. I think that intellect's outputs are much more important than the structures, the hand -touched outputs we can see and that we can touch, while the intelligence and science that cannot even be hand -touched receive significant results that should be supported by our European community much more actively, not only by protecting patents, but by providing for researchers. Everything in order to offer future generations something much more important than we have in the past..(DA) In principle, we oppose that the European Community concludes copyright agreements on behalf of Member States. However, we take into account that it is a common jurisdiction between Member States and the Community, and at the same time, we believe that WIPO's agreements mean an essential shift towards the rights of distributors and performers. Therefore, we vote for the presentation.-(DE) Greens/European Free Alliance Group refrain from voting in this matter, as the Commission member Bolkesin did not answer any of my questions in yesterday's session regarding the EU's accession to WIPO contracts. The role of the European Parliament in the development of WIPO agreements has not been clarified. In addition, the trend is now emerging, according to which international competence is increasingly aimed at the exclusive competence of the EU. However, if it is not clear how the European Parliament can participate in decision -making processes, the legitimacy issue arises. In addition, the agreement does not define the concept of author. The Commission did not respond to which copyright definition its actions are based and whether it intends to reconcile the expected conflicts by forcing others to accept the definition it adopted. One of the most sensitive passages is the public interest whether WIPO's enforcement and application to the privatization of education leads to the privatization of education? Finally, the relationship between Trips and Wipo has to be clarified - the Commission answered by silence. If the parliamentary debate is not invested at all to determine and form a common position, we must at least be arrested for voting!	fi
The report deals with it and proposes to integrate action with the aim of achieving equality between women and men in all aspects of work. It also recognizes the importance of cooperation with local and regional bodies, which are closest to humans to ensure mainstreaming in all the results of the plans. The participation of volunteers and local groups will also be an essential element of the Equal initiative and plans. Development partnerships within the thematic sectors referred to in amendment no.22, they will even allow smaller organizations to play a role in the Equal initiative. My team will support amendment no.22. Mr. President, Mr. Lords, the report discussed today by the plenary is undoubtedly very important. The strong point of the Interreg Community Initiative for the Planning Period 2000-2006, in addition to the objectives it is seeking, lies in the added value it represents in view of the most impending European Union enlargement to new countries in Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean. In the face of the milestone of the enlargement, the European Union, in my opinion, must firmly fight to reduce regional inequalities and end the isolation of the border areas. Indeed, these latter - we must remind us - have an important role to play: a link role with the candidate countries that will be part of the Union. It is in this context that I have submitted some amendments that, in my opinion, are extremely important and that the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee adopted. Their aim is to extend the eligible areas of cross -border areas in all areas of the Adriatic, as well as to those provinces of Sicily that bordered with Malta - candidate to be integrated country - which today, in an inexplicable manner, are not included in Chapter A, Annex 1.of Parliament in this case, in accordance with the Code of Conduct. It is fundamental to the whole of Europe to promote cooperation with prospective countries and to support border areas. Finally, I find it desirable to pursue a greater coordination between the Interreg initiative and the existing community programs that have external policy, as a means of greater completion and a joint programming study. Mr President, gentlemen, dear colleagues, Leader I has experienced real success, especially thanks to the great flexibility of administrative management between the Commission and the local bodies. In my opinion it is regrettable that the Commission did not draw the same report on Leader II, an account of the quality of the plans, the amount of credit spent and, above all, the withdrawal of some local bodies before the administrative and financial burdens with which they were faced. Nevertheless, I express my satisfaction with the fact that new means have been mobilized to provide aid to rural territories in order to develop their potential and implement the goals of local and sustainable development.	el
How can we characterize the logic that in order to punish an alleged oppressor of a people, his alleged victims are punishable? Mr President, this is meant by barbaric bombing, this means a fuel barrier from Yugoslavia. This is a strengthening of a political genocide against a people who do not accept choices in which the United States, NATO and the European Union wants to force it. The question is: Because the cold has already caused many deaths, will the fuel barrier stop and give the people of the Yugoslav people freely decide on their own fate?- (pt) President, I can't make anything that sounds strange to the word mass murder when used by the same government against the Yugoslavian government, which in Kosovo carried out exactly the same behavior model. Also, I do not mind that this same government brought in the past countless situations that have been shaken by Bosnia and Hertzegovia and Croatia and have systematically caused instability throughout the region. I fully understand what a parliamentary member said about the need for each people to decide on their own fate, which is what we want. But we also want it to mean free media, full freedom of expression in the opposition media, a holistic and full right to enjoy rights, freedoms, and individual protection, the principle of the rule of law and the complete transparency of the institutions. If a parliamentary member sees these features in Serbia, it explains everything. Question No. 4 (H-0155/00): Subject: The Council of the European Union Council convicted of death has not answered the question No. P-2697/99 and thus violates the deadlines confirmed in the European Parliament. Does the Council know the number, identity, legal situation, imprisonment conditions of the Member States of the European Union, who are sentenced to death in the rest of the world, and the situation, the personal situation and the family situation? Has these people a list and can it be delivered to me and the European Parliament? If the Council does not have this information, does it not see that it would be necessary to take action to systematic control of these cases? What does it consider it appropriate to eliminate this lack of information?.(Pt) The issue of a member of a parliamentary member is very important, but I have to admit that the Council does not have access to information on the number of union citizens in third countries. However, this is now - I want to make this clear - the work done by Member States 'consular co -operation in monitoring and safeguarding the interests and civil rights of the Member States' third countries, especially when they can receive a death penalty. For this purpose, whenever a Member State citizen is threatened by a death sentence in the third country, there is now a co -operation procedure through which the embassies in these countries can take joint and uniformly managed measures (démarches). This cooperation between the Member States' embassies also includes that they share information about the citizens that the death penalty may threaten. Thus, in a short period of time, I believe that it is possible to answer this question exactly, and to obtain, in particular, accurate and up -to -date information, although of course it depends on how this cooperation between the European Union is developing. Mr President of the Council, thank you for your saying but not for their content. Mean that I thank you for your concern for your concern but - repeat - not for the content you provided. It has been time because I asked the Council three months ago this question, but it did not answer in writing. It did not respond to it within the agreed time limit, but is now respected orally two months late. Do you not think that the chairman of the Council that a list of European citizens convicted of death in the rest of the world would be a very useful tool to defend the right to life and to defend the right of the European Union's political institutions?	fi
"Mr President, the Miloeviæi government does not seem to be tired of the fight. Recently, it has systematically appeared against local radio and television stations. The use of violence is not shown in this context. Also, the media led from above do not map the actual persecution of the country's independent media. They are mocked as ""NATO agents"" and ""traitors of the homeland"". Serbia's magnificent police forces do not work for no reason specifically at the local level, especially in cities where the opposition won in the November 1996 municipal elections. As the municipal elections and also the parliamentary elections approach, many Serbians suspect that the Miloeviæs government has already launched their own campaign. The destination, local radio and television stations, is self-evident from the point of view of Miloeviæ. For anyone who wants to see and hear in small and medium -sized Serbian cities, something other than that of state media in Belgrade can recommend these stations. In brackets: There are hardly any few independent magazines that still appear in the provinces. It further emphasizes the importance of political countermeasures in Serbia's radio operations! As expected, Serbia's monotherapy does not open openly against free media. Legal arguments for missing permits or unpaid payments to the state obscure the true political purpose: making their own people as a silent as possible. Politically correct pop stations, Marko's son Marko and his daughter Marija, are officially accepted for the people. Now that the situation is so unfortunate, everyone who defends press freedom in Serbia deserves our support. Support should not only remain at the level of words, but as states in paragraph 3 of the common resolution, it must be concrete in the form of new broadcasting equipment to be submitted to these stations after the negotiations. Then Miloeviæin Auliite servants are allowed to keep the technical equipment they seized. Iraqi situation: Mr President, the majority of the Security Council - France, China and Russia - are currently in favor of the dismantling of the nearly ten years anti -Iraqi Kauppa Islands. Or actually I should say, the dismantling of the Iraqi people's embargo. Inspectors responsible for the UN Iraqi Iraqi Iraqi gunfighters have destroyed or ordered to destroy weapons and accessories stores or stores of products that can be used to produce weapons of mass destruction. They have confirmed that Iraq has no long -distance missile to threaten its neighbors. Based on several on -site inspections, the International Atomic Energy Agency has come to the conclusion that Iraq has no capacity to produce nuclear weapons, and this issue has been confirmed in reports on three expert groups, such as the Security Council's decision 1284. That is why we ask for the demolition of this embargo in our resolution. Nonetheless, the US government has refused to dissolve the embargo of the commercial island, under the guise that Iraq has not complied with its responsibilities. Without providing the slightest evidence, Washington continues to blame Iraq for the secret production of biological and chemical weapons. In order to respond to this concern - which is not justified by experts - France has suggested to the Security Council that the dismantling of the embargo would be accompanied by continued control of weapons and Iraqi export control. Washington has also dismissed this proposal and thus caused a situation that harms the people of Iraq, not the leaders of the country. According to the UN humanitarian offices, several hundred thousand Iraqis, including about 500,000 children, have died prematurely as a result of the embargo of commercial products due to food products, medicines and proper treatments. For the first time in ten years, the American counseling and parliamentarians' delegation published a report on his trip to Iraq yesterday on March 14, in which it requested the demolition of the embargo for humanitarian reasons. The delegation notes that the ""oil against food"" program is by no means enough to meet the urgent physical needs of the Iraqis. Former French ambassador Eric Rouleau, for his part, speaks of slowing down genocide. Our resolution is thus requested to end this situation."	fi
"Reading our preparatory documents causes some fears about it. We learn from them - forgive me the technical language, but it is not mine - that we have to make a better convergence of the Cologne process for the coordination of macroeconomic policies, the Cardiff process regarding the reforms and the Luxembourg process for the Luxembourg process.for the employment and the multilateral monitoring of fiscal policies. But how do we ensure this better convergence of all these different processes? The presidency document of January 12th provides us with the key to its conclusions. We need to reform the great guidelines of economic policy, which are currently simply have the Council's annual establishment regime to the Member States - to broaden their scope and, above all,: ""To strengthen their character as a framework document"". The mentioned word ""framework"" seems to be perceived here in the dual sense of composition and obligation. With these overall documents, are we not, Mr President, be in the process of re -devising the Central State Intervention Program? We can ask ourselves, especially when we read the part of the French contribution, which creates excessive managing, proposing the coordination of Brussels of an entire series of national policies, for example the sectors of employment, social protection, or media,Such a centralized management would be translated into new violations of supplementary, new harmonization of details, into a new coordination that will be imposed on countries in different situations, that is, it will ultimately be translated into new rigid processes, which will be added to its rigor. In our opinion, the ambition of the Lisbon Council should probably be the removal of these rigid processes, the promotion of flexibility, adaptation, the exchange of positive national experiences to encourage creativity that will only prosper thanks to the freedom of choice. Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Honorable Colleagues, in the announcements we heard, mentioned a respected goal, in particular the goal of becoming us, the European, competitive against the United States, to evolve into equal partners. Given our gross national product, this should normally be possible. But if we watch, on the other hand, what stance by Europeans against Americans, for example, in the administrative sector - when it comes to the election of the new president of the International Monetary Fund - then we are undoubtedly still far from this equal partnership. We have to wonder where this is due. There are sectors of the financial sector - but also in the new media sector - in which we hold first places. I will just mention the cell phones here. Here, in the plenary hall, we banned them justified because they are terribly annoying."	el
While we thought the discussion ended, dazzling amendments reach the plenary, for which I would like to reject.After that, for example, we should finance the art treasures or promote marine tourism with the meager household of fishing.Other amendments, such as number 4, which require the financing of biological recovery phases, also prove a great ignorance of fishing regulations if they demand measures that are already in force, even if everything is still in need of improvement.I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments brought in and to conclude the chapter on fishing and environment with the idea presented in the debate in the committee, namely that both are in close relationships and suffer from the effects of the same attack on the environment.As I have said so many times, fisheries are more victim as the cause of destruction of the sea ecosystem, and tomorrow, in the pronunciation about the Erika, we will have the opportunity to prove this.President!The report by Mr. Katiforis had preferred a message in which the Commission was limited to listing a number of good wishes, but to admit their inability to their practical implementation, to fill with liveliness, polemics and controversial spirit.What Mr. Katiforis was not missing was the courage to demonstrate the measures that, in his opinion, could contribute to the relaxation and maintenance of the natural resources of the sea.I say this from the non -understanding of many of his suggestions because I am one of those who believe that not only resources are important in fishing - they are - but also the people who have had this job for centuries.I agree with the rapporteur that a stronger coordination of European fishing and environmental policy is required.But what we basically miss is courage and political determination on the part of the Commission and the Member States to make decisions and apply the already valid regulation.Not only fishing and the environment should be integrated, but also maritime traffic, employment or energy.With regard to the structural funds, I could mention a number of examples here, but I will rescue that for another opportunity.The European Parliament is aware of the limitation of resources and the need to carry out responsible fishing.It demands strictness by the Commission and the Member States to comply with TAC and the quotas defined according to objective scientific criteria and demand that everyone is measured with the same level.As Mr. Katiforis says, the repellents are a waste of resources that we must not accept.Twenty million tons of non -usable catches are thrown back.The fleet must be equipped with fishing devices for ever more selective fishing.This parliament has already opposed the drift nets, and yet we determine how certain states not only disregard the obligation of their elimination, but also increase the number of ships with this fishing device or simply do not transmit any data in view of the passivity of the national and community authorities.We socialists believe that the defense of common fishing policy means to stand up for regulated and controlled fishing activity.It is essential that the Commission initiates an information campaign via the GFP with this message.	de
There is also no doubt that red tone has a huge environmental and economic important. Being a fisherman's own amateur-athlete, I would like to see the days of the 1930s come back when fishermen from the port of Scarborough in Yorkshire were fishing a red tone weighing up to 830 pounds. I do not know the metric match. Thus, I support the findings of ICCAT and support the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues. However, about this discussion I am afraid that we are losing our time while the world is burning. Common fishing policy does not work. As for the whole big -hearted debate on maintenance, the truth is that the quota system leads directly to environmental destruction. In mixed fishing you cannot discriminate. The huge volume of fish rear -off again means that any improvement in fishing data makes no sense. On the UK side there is also a deep political objection to the CSR. Many people now are of the opinion that if this is a federal system, you can keep it for yourself. Let me explain it to you with a local example. In February, the Commission's 394/2000 Regulation was issued with the aim of protecting the Ireland Sea. This means that on Fleetwood, 30 coastal fishing fishery until the end of April. Scientists and fishermen agree that something must be done. However, more than twelve large Belgian trawlers were excluded from the regulation, so ships that initially caused the problem continue to fish, while it is a criminal offense for the UK fleet to do so. The CFP is not helping to maintain and enhances the British public to the point where we ask to re -apply to our own territorial waters. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Ladies and Lords, Mr. Gallagher's report on the fourth amendment of the technical measures, did not include amendments by our Commission, unanimously approved and congratulated Mr Gallagher. This reveals, among other things, that there is a wide consensual spirit in our committee when we are going to support measures aimed at protecting species, such as the case of us, that of tuna. Decisions, of course, that the Commission must support the International Committee on the maintenance of the Atlantic Tonal, which the Commission has requested that we consult with it, as well as being represented at meetings as an observer, for greater and better control and to support the role of the European Parliament. I am very pleased, Mr Fischler, that the Commission responded positively to our request to the latest and most constructive debate we have held on this matter, and we were asked to attend the forthcoming meeting in March, in order to find out about the next preparatory meeting of the Committee. Consequently, the criticism of our rapporteur at this point was heard. I would like to draw attention to the view that is widespread in the report on the fact that in 1975 the weight of the red tone was proposed to have a minimum of 6.4 kg, with a 15% margin of tolerance in the number of catch across the Atlantic.	el
The reflection on the scope of the regulation is in my opinion of prime importance. First, the plans must be more intended to restore rainforests. However, the Council of Council Regulation was probably overly interested in protecting tropical forests and improperly to exploit their production potential. In addition, future Community actions should take into account all aspects of sustainable forestry. This implies respect for the indigenous peoples depending on forest ecosystems. We must not overlook that the necessary involvement of these vulnerable populations is in very important obstacles: these forest zones often know the situations of riots and conflicts, as well as the degenerative effects of tourism that is often present as the miraculous solution, as well as local laws. Of course, there are forests that have escaped any productive activity, but there are also forests whose financial functions are maintained. This is the case of our own forests within the European Union and, dear colleagues, I ask you: What was the community aid offered to our European Forests that were destroyed by the storms of last December? We must, of course, respond to the challenge of this report, but we must also establish a real Community conservation policy and sustainable forest management. I hardly need to emphasize the importance of tropical forests for the whole world, given our influence on climate standards, the great proportion of global biodiversity that contain and certainly their importance for the economic survival of millions of people in developing countries. For them and for other reasons, European citizens are rightly awaiting the community to support actions for the maintenance and sustainable management of tropical forests. I am talking about tropical forests, but in fact a new feature of this regulation compared to the previous one is that the scope of the regulation now covers all developing countries, and therefore now includes countries such as South Africa and China, as well as areas of the Mediterranean and the Middle East. The regulation also explicitly refers to the needs of indigenous and populations dependent and to the need to take into account gender issues. We recently discussed the environmental regulation and the comments I made at that time on some horizontal issues are largely applicable to forest regulation. So I'll be short. Regarding the amendments available in the Fernandez Martnn report, the position of the committee on the main horizontal issues is as follows: on the funding amount of reference, the Commission accepts the compromise of EUR 249 million for seven years proposed in amendment no.9, regarding commissionology. The Commission first supports the amendment no.11, but prefers to formulate amendments no.13, 14 and 15. The amendments propose a separate settlement of Committee issues, with the annual guidelines and priorities to be decided under the management process, while the Council will consider plans of more than € 2 million based on the consulting procedure.	el
Finally, I would say that the next meeting of the Human Rights Commission will also discuss the rationalization of its own work. There is a working group on the renewal of the mechanisms of the committee that has worked closely and that it is necessary to enhance the current mechanisms and make them more precise, especially in the field of funding. The European Union is opposed to all kinds of false efforts that, when reforming the work of the Human Rights Commission, attempts to eliminate its intervention by reducing its area of ​​operation and the constant monitoring of the human rights situation in the world..(EN) Mr President, I would like to thank the Presidential State for the preparatory work it has done for the Geneva meeting in areas such as racism, civil rights and political rights, and the right to development. As the Presidential State stated, there is still much to do, despite the understandable requirement of Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should present its position well in advance of the Geneva meeting. It is easier to say than done we still deal with some of the most toughest topics. For example, many issues presented in the Parliament's resolution are currently being discussed, and it is too early to anticipate the outcome in all cases. It is no surprise that negotiations are long and difficult. This does not mean that human rights improvement has been committed inadequately, but is an indication of the usual attempt to get the right approach so that we can really influence the matter. However, I can illustrate this aspiration by dealing with three controversial topics: death penalty, Cuba and China. I'm going to do so uncomfortably that I reveal a couple of my personal thoughts in my processing. We are currently looking at alternatives and opportunities to submit a resolution on the death penalty in the Human Rights Commission. This has always been a topic I have had a strong personal belief, I have always voted against the death penalty. Inspired by Amnesty International and other organizations, the first decision I made as a Governor of Hong Kong was to eliminate the death penalty. We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly. We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or to take the risk that there would have been a resolution that would have completely condemned claims that human rights are not applicable and valid worldwide. New York's Arena differs from Geneva Arena. Last year, a debate on sovereignty and humanitarian activities in New York was such a sensitive topic that it affected all other topics. It certainly influenced the debate on the postponement of the death penalty. However, Geneva's negotiations focus more on human rights issues. Therefore, we may have a better chance of getting progress there. Secondly, Cuba. I want to address this topic directly because we Europeans are unjustifiably criticized for not being serious enough about Cuban human rights. We are extremely concerned about the measures taken by the Cuban government last year to further reduce public freedom, change criminal law and scope the death penalty. We are also concerned that the number of political arrests has recently increased. We monitor the human rights situation through the activities of our human rights workgroup in NGO reports and Havana's Embassy work. We have regularly criticized the Cuban authorities, and Parliament has done the same. However, I believe that the situation is not solved by trying to isolate Cuba. We want a fair and open society in Cuba, Cuban, which respects the principles of the market, the non -violation of contracts and the principles of the rule of law. We want to promote its transition to democracy and respect for human rights and basic freedoms. My views are exactly the same when looking at the third topic I want to deal with, that is, China. I simply want to keep in touch with China. It would be self -sufficient self -deception and also offensive to more than a fifth of humanity to strive further. I also want to see China to become peacefully free and pluralistic society, which does not capture advocates or believers in democracy. So what should we do? Of course, we should be eager to trade with China and hope that we can welcome China to the world's trade organization under reasonable terms.	fi
"Mr. President, the Commissioner, the peace process in the Middle East is an extremely delicate question.The exact boundaries of the State of Israel, the only democracy in this region, can only be recognized by all if these negotiations lead.The implementation of the trade agreement between the European Union and Israel, which no longer defines the territory of the State of Israel, must be done in this context.Add to this the existence of a close link between economic activities on the Israeli side and those on Palestinian territory.To this end, the Paris protocol annexed to the Oslo agreements also provides for a customs ""envelope"" which includes the state of Israel and the Palestinian authority.In addition, the commission and the aforementioned parties have agreed that a joint labor group is set up to approach issues of origin, in particular the fact that the Palestinian economy felt of unilateral approaches from the European Union.Potential investors in this region have already said that they will retire if the joint ventures no longer have the preference.Mr. President, this assembly generally shares the concern raised in the question of Madame Morgantini.I believe that Commissioner Verorino clearly expressed the position of the Commission and, in my opinion, responded adequately to the concerns here aroused, but it seems to me that we should not stop there.This is why it seems to me that we could, from this assertion, expand the convergent points based on the precious information that Madame Morgantini and I were able to deduct during a visit to the region with the president of Parliament.I first believe that, despite the existing difficulties that we have seen in situ, we must reiterate our support for direct dialogue between the government of Israel and the Palestinian Authority, with a view to a fair, stable and final peace agreement.Secondly, I think that the two parties have an interest in ensuring the economic development of the region and in firmly facing the reduction of the significant wealth imbalances observed in the region.Third, finally, the Commission could perhaps take into account the usefulness of deepening the task of a trilateral working group, of course with the participation of the European Union, guaranteeing compliance with trade agreements and making us progress in the cooperation that the European Union offers for the benefit of all the parties concerned.I listened to the response from Commissioner Vitorino and I must say that I am satisfied.I think his intervention answers the questions contained in the question.I too believe that we must underline the importance, for the European Union and therefore, from the executive point of view, for the Commission, to promote tripartite activities, in particular with regard to the levels of economic and scientific cooperation, so that our quantitative presence in pecuniary terms can more often transform into a more significant presence in the Middle East.Here, I believe, the lesson to be drawn from this already old story.As for the specific object, I heard that Mr. Galeote referred to the visit of our president and Mr. Menéndez del Valle to that of the Prodi President in Israel and in other countries of the Middle East."	fr
"Mr President, I would like to thank Mr. Guterres for his explanations this evening as well as for his initiative with regard to the summit in Lisbon, which is very important to us.If we are honest, we have to admit that it was a long way from the employment summit in Luxembourg to the summit in Lisbon, and that we can now expect concrete results from this summit in Lisbon, so something tangible has to come out.Many European citizens sit in the grandstand tonight, and I wonder what they may think of today's discussion.I hope that these citizens will leave the plenum in the certainty this evening that the institutions of the European Union have now initiated a process that will truly lead to restoring full employment in the European Union.There are many challenges in front of us on the way to full employment.Some of these challenges will be difficult to cope with, but it is important that we have been implementing what we have been talking about for many, many years, namely full employment, a society without social exclusion, a society of innovation and knowledge.This lies the great challenge and the great importance of the Lisbon summit.I would like to briefly go into some key aspects, with the help of which we will be able to have our words follow.Firstly, we have to define corner values ​​and initiate a mutual evaluation process, we have to set goals, real goals that we can achieve, and we have to bring the governments to the courage that requires some courage, in which they say: ""Yes, we do not shy away from the comparison, we will be measured with the rest of the world.""Nobody pleasant.However, it is important if the summit in Lisbon is to lead to concrete results and not in a different direction - a direction that Prime Minister Guterres certainly does not want to strike because he is really interested in the fact that something is achieved at the summit in Lisbon.Other areas must also not be neglected.This includes the challenge of creating an ""e-Europe"" in which all citizens are involved and in which nobody falls by the wayside.Another area is the creation of a real internal market, which we still don't have, and qualification measures are part of the fact that it is of central importance for the introduction of an innovative knowledge society.This requires difficult decisions, but I would like to contact the citizens again in the grandstand who pursue this pronunciation and to whom I would like to give confidence that we will achieve a fully employed society that the summit in Lisbon will be at the end of a long way and will provide concrete results.I welcome the new strategic goal to make Europe the most dynamic and most competitive space.Who could question such an ambitious goal?However, I would like to point out that dynamics and entrepreneurial spirit as well as social cohesion are ambitious goals, not to mention the creative area of ​​tension between these two goals."	de
"When the project expires after five years, there will also be a free giving policy. In my opinion, cost factors need to be developed from the beginning of all projects, and as far as I know, this is not always the case. Then finally, I wonder if the funds could not be used a little better. Every year, I discover the Commission and the European Development Fund's budget that they are heavily behind the use of funds. Mr President, the Mr President of the Council, the Member of the Commission and the Monitorial Colleagues, we actually have a discussion among those who are already convinced, which is unfortunate. For example, the debate on the consistency of development policies should go with Prod, who at the beginning lost a great opportunity because he gave him a division of development policies between three members of the commission, which is already progressing over four - but does not guarantee consistent policies. We can also say that even different Directors are sometimes intervened in this policy with very contradictory procedures and justification. The Chairman of the Council made a good recommendation to fund the European Development Fund. Of course, Parliament would be extremely pleased if you could do so, and that would be a huge historical victory. After Amsterdam, three concepts have been key: complementary nature, coordination and cohesion. In my opinion, very little has been done in these three areas so far. If you are already asking for a report on progress on cohesion, it cannot be difficult to produce it, because you simply have to admit that there is no cohesion. I would prefer to make a story of a lack of cohesion as it is now revealed, and to develop a consistent strategy to achieve a certain cohesion because we are still far from it. I was shocked by a matter of the chairman of the Council. He said that ""contrasts in politics can lead to balance.""In fact, what the other hand gives can be removed with one hand or vice versa. This leads to stagnation and self -deception, and so far the whole world of the world has led to the fact that changes have really occurred, but that these changes have only made poverty increase. This is then called our priority. I know we do a lot of good things, but it is better for us to start with essential things. Mr President, we have already stated that the Commission has not given any report, but I will bring out the three things related to the objectives that the Council presented in his resolution in 1997. The first relates to conflict resolution. For many years, I have been trying to find out why no institution is actively involved in resolving a conflict in Moroccan-occupied conflict. The UN has a peace plan. We should take this opportunity and complete the last colonial episode in Africa. I also want to bring out migration. I am concerned about the new regulations of the ACP Partnership Agreement, which can make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on a looser basis. Indeed, I also want to see that the EU acts as a pioneer in the patenting of living organisms. Nowadays, we know that more often than every four seconds, someone dies of starvation. Three quarters of them are children under the age of five. This is not due to food shortage, but about what we have discussed a lot today, namely growing poverty. Food safety and biological diversity must be more important than commercial benefits. I mean that the patenting of living organisms is merely to monitor global food supply, and only for commercial specific purposes, and nothing else. I also want to mention the report from the Commission to mention one of the women. Women seem to be completely missing from all connections, in particular all connections related to development policy, which is not really true. Mr President, today's debate strongly emphasizes the importance of discussing development policies much more widely than measuring development aid granted."	fi
"The overall goal is to achieve good and positive results in order for politics to translate into legislative acts. The framework for the process of Committee is clearly determined in the above -mentioned Council decision. The right to control for parliament is provided for areas related to co -opinion, namely Article 8. The amended Directive 64/432 is based on Articles 37 and 152 of the Treaty. The new provision on the implementation responsibilities that allows the Commission to establish transitional measures may have a direct impact on public health. That is why the Commission, in this case, proposes Article 17a referring to a Regulatory Committee with the right to control for parliament. I refer you specifically to Article 3 of the Directive which amending Article 16 of the original which is said: ""Where it is necessary to facilitate the transition to the new arrangements provided for in this Directive, the Commission, acting on the basis of the procedures provided for in Article 17A, may approve transitional measures that will apply for a period of time. Service, the appropriate way of dealing with the issue. In Article 3, it clearly stipulates that Article 17A is the appropriate article to address the issue, which incorporates Article 8 of the Council of Council last June, thereby giving parliament the full authority of control over any such proposal. Where referring to the current edition of 64/432 in Article 17, this relates to the applicable animal health measures based on Article 37 and have nothing to do with, or in a few cases very little to do with public health. These measures, therefore, should not be subject to the right to control by parliament. For example, such applicable measures relate to the approval of processes and cleaning and disinfection areas, the form of reference of diseases, the approval of the concentration centers, the determining of additional guarantees for Member States where there have been no cases of diseases of non -transmitted human disease, such as infectious or infectious rosemary.pigs. I will now make some observations on the impact of the proposed amendment on institutional balance. The executive powers of the Commission are adopted in Article 202, the third dash of the EC Treaty in conjunction with the Council's Decision 99/468 which I have mentioned above and which is the appropriate decision of the Council establishing the appropriate process of Committee. This system is clearly aimed at precisely defining the corresponding roles of executive and legislative power in the basic legislative instrument. Consequently, the basic legislative act must be made clear from the outset what applicable measures are based on the procedures for co -fascination, that is to say, Article 152, and which provisions are not aimed at protecting public health, so they are not subject to Parliament's right to exercise control."	el
"What is social justice after all, unless it involves full employment? Full employment is the best way to create social justice for our citizens. This is our central focus area. I have a positive attitude towards a couple of initiatives that the Commission has already given and are helpful to us: in particular, the Commission member Liikanen is committed to an innovative and knowledge -based economy. Yes, ""e-europe"" is our future because it helps us create new well-being and new jobs. I am positive about the Commission's current and previous initiatives to support small and medium -sized enterprises, and I would like to congratulate Portugal on the Presidency of Portugal for the Micro -Business Charter. This is important and can be developed at the Lisbon Summit. I also have a positive view of the Commission's idea of ​​Busquin's idea of ​​a joint research area of ​​the entire European Union. This, too, is a way to promote better jobs and well -being. Mr President Prodi, you said in your summary that liberation, competitiveness, low inflation, innovation, science and technology are essential for the future success of the European economy and the creation of jobs. I agree with you very much, but we can't take anything for granted. We have to do even more, and the Lisbon Summit will be part of it. With these considerations, I would like to congratulate you on the program and wish it the best success. Mr President, the Mr President of the Commission, I would like to focus on two aspects that are not mentioned in your program. I have the impression that this Commission's five-year strategy document is read as a scientific work or declaration of principles on the European Union. Unfortunately, however, it does not convey the impression of the Commission's true political strategy. As a cultural and education policy speaker in my group, I could have just imagined more content from the Italian Commission chairman. In this way, the Commission does not give Europe a soul! In fact, this statement simply does not mention culture and education at all. However, creating a true education and culture in Europe is essential. Next only a few keywords. I talk about the integration of politicians in the cultural industry into this education and cultural area. They create jobs. I am talking about the cultural pass-by principle in all fields of politics, to strengthen and improve the European trend in education and educational content, and to combine education and education policies in Europe. I emphasize lifelong learning. Mr President of the Commission, you also did not talk about the European audiovisual region, and saw at the beginning of the new millennium! In addition, I noticed that you did not mention the information policy and communication, which is responsible for taking into account the needs of citizens. So I think this program lacks a variety of things. True European citizenship depends on creating and making a real education and cultural area. The declaration of principles is not enough! We need content that the Commission is constantly implemented by the Commission in the way I described earlier through political actions. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission Prodi, what would be your own policy and work program financial statements, then what would it be for your standards, should you be nominated for direct elections? You have a good and charming idea that the result or voting of the next European Parliament elections would be your policy and the result and measurement of your five -year program. When I imagine that I should explain to my work program to my selectors I see weekly - not in the high circles of important policies but on the street - I ask what should I say to them then? Mr President Prodi, what should I say, what's new? There is nothing new in your work program. You needed 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year work program. Does it make me hopeful for 2000? No, that's it! You find something very wise for your 2000 work program."	fi
The Mr President, the Member of the Commission, De Palacio, the Commission's proposal already in 1998 is to replace the Directive on commercial vehicles. The proposal proposes the introduction of surprise tests, as the cars must be in order even between annual inspections. These surprise tests can be performed on roadside, ports or areas where trucks are parked. So this is an improving road safety in the EU, which is really important. The damage caused by trucks in a traffic accident is most often significantly high and the condition of the cars is quite varied across Europe, so it is a benefit of public legislation and non-compliance with every single road. In the EU, there are a major concern for poor trucks from Eastern Europe, which must be addressed with a tight hand. Coming from East Karelia myself, I know that if there was light in the other lamp and half-wheeled brakes, it would be a good thing. The joint position of the Council will significantly improve road safety, and the directive should be effective. However, when implementing punishment systems, it is important to note that the punishment must by no means be directed at the Member State, but on the driver or entrepreneur. Enlightenment is a good thing, but unfortunately only proper penalties will work on eye worshipers. Road safety is a serious matter. A few weeks ago, a tragic accident from Helsinki, where a bike from a truck killed a small child. In matters of life, we will never take too much responsibility..(ES) Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, I would like to thank the rapporteur Piecy and the corresponding parliamentary committee for their work they did. The rapporteur is really quite right when he says that the name is very long. It would be the simplest to talk about truck inspections, which are ultimately all about, and perhaps we should all consider using a technical name in our documents and also put a more understandable name in the soup or citizens. I will give this matter to the Commission units and look at it in the event of an anti -person. However, the proposal itself is clearly about roadside inspections of both persons and commercial vehicles carrying goods, which aim to improve safety and environmental protection in community road traffic. It undoubtedly aims to create the structure of commercial vehicles in the community, as it makes it difficult for carriers and operators who are trying to gain a competitive advantage by operating in lack of vehicles. The proposal requires Member States to supplement the annual technical inspection by surprise inspections in some of their roads operating annually on their roads. These inspections can be carried out on roads, ports or other places where vehicles are parked, or in the case of public transport, mainly on the premises of carriers. In fact, many Member States already have such so -called roadside inspections, and even in a way planned, in a sense, they are made in a sense unexpectedly. This may indeed be the best way to effectively monitor the condition of vehicles operating in our road network. I would like to say that the Commission is aware that Parliament is concerned that this proposal may lead to discrimination against private carriers or even certain vehicles in certain countries, and that the recommendation of the rapporteur is to harmonize the fines imposed by Member States as a condition of the application of the directive. We agree with this concern, but we consider the check 2 too radical, and for this reason we support the review 3, which reaches the common aspiration of all of us and at the same time contains enough flexibility. We also accept review 1 and I want to refer to the words of the rapporteur Bouwman. We are indeed very concerned that vehicles carried by third countries, especially candidates, citizens, in particular, are operating on the roads of the Union, which do not have employment contracts in accordance with the rules of the Community or any of the Member States of any Community, but that only comply with these third countries, mostly candidate states,	fi
As chairman of its preparatory team, I will be happy to consider this request to the inter -board meeting. For these issues of nuclear power plants in Ukraine, nuclear power plants whose names - Hmelnytskyi and Rivne - hardly can vote, against the fact that the Commission's competence is to submit technical assessments of nuclear power plants to determine their maintenance or closure. In March 1994, the Council approved the decision to authorize the Commission to take Euratom loans up to as much as EUR 1,100 million to support the improving the efficiency and safety of some third countries nuclear power plants. Until now, only the third country has not taken advantage of this opportunity. This procedure, by the way, was based on an agreement on Euratom and did not require hearing the European Parliament. Finally, I would say that the questions asked are a very subtle problem field that we have - as we know - highlighted in this representative room in recent years to increase the powers of Parliament, and for that purpose, Parliament has exercised its own budget as a legal means of pressure. In particular, to speak of the Kedo case, it would be reminded that the Parliament frozen the cash reserved for that year in 1998, and this situation was only revealed by a compromise agreed with the Commission, where this institution promises to give the Parliament on the Euratom agreements at the beginning of the year. Thank you, a dignified minister. I would continue the issue of HVK so that Parliament is likely to ask in connection with the reform of the institutions and, in particular, the Department of Decision Procedures, that it could give a supportive opinion on international agreements and participate in the joint decision in other matters. So how do you think these discussions are going in HVK?- (pt) Member of the Parliament, the extension of the joint decision -making procedure used in the legislation is something that has been discussed at the inter -governmental meeting and otherwise, as you know, a more radical traditional position supported by many Member States, according to which all legislative decisions made by the Council should be subjected to the European Parliament. This position has received an enthusiastic reception at the inter -governmental meeting, but there are other Member States who, in terms of matters subject to the joint decision, defend a case -by -case review even in legislative matters. I already had the opportunity to raise the issue of ratification of international agreements at the inter -governmental meeting and in the first consideration of this requirement and at the same time its traditional position did not receive any enthusiastic reception among Member States;Because this issue has not yet been removed from the agenda because all these things are kept on the agenda until the decision of the meeting, we do not seem to be able to progress significantly at this stage. But let's not yet end the dialogue with the European Parliament. Next Tuesday, I will have a meeting in the Committee on Institutional Affairs, where I will certainly discuss this and explain in a little detailed how the inter -governmental meeting preparatory team intends to deal with such matters, and especially the list of demands and proposals in the European Parliament, which we hope to diversify with the 23rd day. Question No 6 (H-0160/00): Subject: Compensation to the victims of the Fascist War Many Greek courts have confirmed the right of Greek citizens who have become a victim of Nazi administration, but this is still unresolved because Germany has not paid the war compensation for Greece and forced the Greece to make the Greece in 1943. In order to pay the damages of the victims of the fascist war and return the occupation loans, given the agreement of German recently signed by German industrial companies for forced workers of FIM 10 billion and the fact that the formal explanation of Germany, after German integration, is no longer valid?	fi
The measures are not limited to legislation.To promote and support the dialogue as a cornerstone of successful adaptation to change, the Commission is currently also dealing with the recommendations of the Lillehammer report by working on the establishment of a European observation center for industrial change.We also deal with another proposal of this group of experts, with the report on the management of change.Finally, let me go into some of the other questions that are addressed in the defense draft presented in this high house.As far as the connection between competition and social policy is concerned, I would like to remind you that there is a provision in the merger control regulation that gives employee representatives the opportunity to be heard by the Commission as part of the corresponding procedure.On the whole, we recognize the need that in the different instances of all aspects associated with such measures, including their consequences for employment, due attention is paid.As an example, I mention that the public authorities, in particular the Commission, on the way of guidelines for the national regional allowance, which took effect on January 1 of this year, have already taken action to ensure that the provision of public funds will continue to be linked to the recipients of regional allowances and consequently to the jobs associated with the investment.For this purpose, any regional allowance is made dependent on the existence of the respective investment for a minimum period of five years.The same provision was included in the regulation on the structural funds, so that it applies to all investments co -financed for all of the structural funds.The social cohesion and the interaction of politics at the EU level are the focus of the upcoming Lisbonian summit.I know we will come back to these questions in the future to see how best we can make sure that our policies will be adapted and reformed in order to support economic and social progress in Europe.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.Mr. Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I see that you report to the rules of procedure.If it is a personal explanation, would you please wait until the end of this pronunciation?I would like to give you the word.President!It is a question of public honor in this parliament, it is not a personal explanation.This morning, the Parliamentary President, Ms. Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to let me speak about the rules of procedure.Unfortunately, this is not the first time that the Ms. President behaved towards me in this inadmissible way.The President of the President has thus violated Article 142, according to which a request for rules of procedure has priority in front of all other requests to speak.She also violated Article 122, which gives all members of this house the right to personal remarks, with which the statements of another MP who are rejected by Ms. Vidal-Quadra.This partisan behavior of our president should be criticized with all reprint.I am always ready to accept the apology from the President of the President.Thank you for your explanation.Of course, we will ensure that the president is informed about her explanation.I can assure you that, according to my knowledge, the President is always reluctant to give a topic -related pronunciation in the middle of a vote.	de
"Dear colleagues, as already mentioned repeatedly, the proposal for the Directive is really a historical opportunity to simplify and improve this chaos and patchwork of European regulations and directives and thus achieve a high level of environmental protection in Europe. However, I have the impression that the policy of the Water Framework Directive is characterized by deregulation and re -nationalization tendencies. I hope by the vote there will not be a hole in the water, and to avoid this I consider two points important. One point concerns Ospar, the contract for the protection of the marine environment of the northeast Atlantic. We know that the European Commission's proposal is not extensive enough. The same applies to the proposal of the Environment Committee. It is not enough to make suggestions in the approximately. What we need is a legally binding objective for Ospar. Only then will we be able to have legal clarity, and above all the opportunity to take lawsuits. Everything else would bypass their goal and would not help prevent ecological disasters in European territory, such as those we see happening today in Romania and Hungary. I find it very regrettable that national governments are not willing to support a legally binding protection, although they have signed the OSPAR contract internationally. I think this is exactly what we have to replenish here in Parliament in order to show that we will not allow the credibility of our policy to be lost or affected. It is also important to strengthen the ""Pollution Payments"" principle, as prices must reflect the truth ecologically. We must not succumb to the pressures of the interests of the agricultural and chemical industry but we must advertise this principle and seek supporters for it and with our vote to show that we want its implementation, and consequently prices that will cover the costs. Waters are our most important vital resource and with our vote we must ensure that there is motivation and pressure to comply with the Ospar Convention. This would be possible with closed production circuits, everything else would be weakening the directive. So let's take this opportunity! Mr President, in the little time I have I would like to praise the rapporteur's report and remind you of three principles that must prevail with all the other principles that clearly refer to the amendments to the rapporteur: water is not a commercial good, but the inheritance of the peoples of the Union,groundwater and needs to be informed by the population in order to be able to participate in water recovery and not to waste it excessively when it is such an important good. I know that this directive may have problems, because there has been a reference to the different reality of the different countries of the Union. It is not the same thing that is happening in the north with what is happening in the South nor with what is happening in countries that face problems of derogation. I know it."	el
"I consider this to be a report in which the cooperation between the committees worked very well, and the result that we have today is a sober, factual report in a particularly delicate area.Soberness and objectivity, which are therefore particularly necessary in the development of Article 280.4.Because if we would have to award a price for the article, which is most difficult to understand, the least clear, most unclear - as you want to describe it - then there would certainly be a hard competition because the contract is a model collection of complicated articles, but this is without a doubt one of the most promising candidates.At the same time, it is a particularly delicate question because it concerns the protection of the financial interests of the community, as Ms. Theato said very correctly.We are all aware of the necessity - and this parliament has raised this concern or has been a great pioneer in this matter - to protect the financial interests of the community.But be careful, as the French say, ""ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'auu du bain"", you must not release the child with the bathing, that is, when protecting the financial interests of the community, on the one hand - and Ms. Theato said - the responsibilities of the nation states have to respect, but also other things that concern the citizens that affect the essential guarantees.You will be preserved without restrictions by the conclusions of the report Theato.Therefore, I hope in my capacity as chair of the committee for law and internal market and of course also in my capacity as a member of the parliament that this parliament supports the report with a large majority tomorrow and that it will experience a good implementation through the Commission.Mr President, as Ms. Theato stated, this report touches a critical topic.This report was proposed by the budget control Committee and developed as a initiative report.One of the reasons, which is why we absolutely wanted to do something, is that the European Union is still said to be fraud and mismanagement, whether we like it or not.Sometimes it is exaggerated, but there is something on the allegations and we have to do something about it.Some of the measures we have decided in the past are ignored by some Member States.We must not forget that the Member States are responsible for the implementation of the EU budget.Many of them have so far neither signed nor ratified the Convention to protect financial interests, so that it was clear that radical more must be intervened.We have to take this responsibility seriously.We have to be able to proceed against people who commit fraud to the disadvantage of the European Union.The question arises as to who should do that.It gets really difficult here.Who is responsible in a body that includes numerous countries?We also have to take into account the interests of the Member States.The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor is extremely reasonable.It is clear to us all that a clearly federal approach and conditions under which a European judicial organ has priority to the respective national judicial organs, some of them go too far.But the discussion has to start, and we therefore ask the government conference to initiate it."	de
High representative Solana and Commission member Patten have been trying to make a definition of EU and NATO defense policy in recent months - including in discussions with the NATO Council. In fact, the impression of both of them is that Petersberg's duties are suitable for the long -term EU defense policy. The basic agreements also refer to in that direction, but they also leave even more room for maneuver. They leave even more room for maneuver in the direction of a more general defense policy that is more related to old speeches from the integration of our policies to one European pillar. We would perform through this NATO European pillar. I really hear less about this. I have the impression that the European Union has restricted its ambition to Petersberg's duties that Patten takes care of civilian matters - including the police and official units, which he has just rightly spoken enthusiastically - and Solana then takes care of the military and military contribution. Naturally, they work together in excellent cooperation. This seems to me for granted. Is there nothing else here? Isn't it really going to do something that says that defense policy really emphasizes the role of NATO in a common defense? The European pillar is no longer working as such, and Europe is limited to Petersberg's position. Is we really hoping that this is done in this way? In addition, there is talk of the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union, but there is no longer a talk of Article 5, which naturally has to be dealt with immediately. Then it is a bigger defense task and not just Petersberg's duties. Will the article be deleted? At the same time, there is also talk of increasing defense budgets in a general sense. I think it's a good thing, but this petition does not really make a exact difference between Petersberg's tasks and major common defense tasks. I wonder how things are evolving. I would really like to ask both people how they really see the situation. Is it necessary to pay closer attention to this at HVK, or can this happen automatically within the framework of the Treaties? I am pleased that there has been room for maneuver in defense policy. However, I am amazed that if Turkey offers a brigade, whether we also have to give it the right to be involved in deciding on politics. Turkey sits permanently in the government. It's strange to me. Second, the Baltic countries also offer. Do they also participate in our defense policy? This is at least a very interesting setting. Mr. High Representative, you effectively reminded of the advances we have achieved in this area from the Amsterdam Summit until the Helsinki Summit, and some conclusions that were suddenly made after the Helsinki summit, such as forming three committees and a decision of 50,000 to 60,000 military troops. However, this aid of matters causes the journey between these decisions and the ongoing inter -governmental conference to be seen more and more visible. I believe that we must achieve a positive conciliation solution between those who, in a way, are eligible for the communalization of this policy and between those who believe that these developments must remain within the inter -governmental conference. I would like to say to these latter: be accurate, as significant democratic approval is needed in this field of politics. We know what the weight of public opinion is when addressing foreign and security policy issues. For this reason, I ask you, of course, only in general whether you think it would be possible to deal with the following questions in the reform: the double structure between the Commission and the high representative towards a new definition;A clear and non-civilian difference between civilian administration and military management. This could so far mean, for example, the merger of the Commission with the Political Committee, the strengthening of the Community's powers in non-military control, the creation of the Council of Defense, the Convention of the European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU: and the legal role of the European Union is another issue;Lastly, financing.	fi
(The President removes the speech from the speaker) Mr President, I would like to speak here, after the devastating chocolate vote that was done before and I do not feel very proud of what we have voted for. Indeed, I think we must remind you that the European Parliament has taken responsibility to modify the composition of even chocolate, accepting the addition of other oils, vegetable fats other than cocoa butter. I would like to say that the European Parliament is not in line with public opinion for a number of reasons. First of all, it is not consistent in relation to consumers' request for clear marking. We did not agree on this marking in chocolate. It is also not in line with the ever -increasing view of GMOs. By just three votes, we were precisely rejected to succumb to the use of GMOs in chocolate. In addition, we have violated the principle of prevention, rejecting previous studies on the evaluation of the impact on the impact this directive will have on production countries, and so on. Nothing happened. The question we can ask is who really benefits this manipulation and; (the President removes the speech by the speaker), Mr President, in our vote today, I am a sweet victory for the British chocolate producers in their struggle to recognize the good of the British. The winners are not only British chocolate producers, but also chocolate consumers across Europe, who will now be able to dive into the enjoyment of Dairy Milk, Galaxy and Milky Way at will. Clearly labeling the ingredients on the label will allow them to choose and enjoy the chocolate they want. Their tasty calves will no longer be restricted due to European chocolate policy. Developing countries are also among the winners. The legislation takes into account the needs of the poorest farmers in the world. The vegetable fats that will be allowed will come from the tropical countries, and the results of the directive will be reviewed after three years. And best of all, the directive will generally increase chocolate sales, thereby increasing the market for exports from developing countries. Chocolates can now be safely chewed, knowing that they also help the third world in their own way. I am sure you will agree that the EU in the past had done it a little bit of soaking in this matter. Some governments are hit so much to protect their chocolate companies, which have eventually made them milkshake. But for them, the time of bitter truth has arrived and their chocolates have lost their eggs and lilacs. It is time for the European Parliament to give those who snobbish the chocolate two Cadbury 's sticks to put them where they know..(EN) It's been sixteen years since the chocolate debate began in the European Parliament. I believe that we should not even deal with this directive. Discussions about national tastes and products offer us an overly large field for ridiculous discussions. Consumer selection must be done regardless of what the EU is doing, and that is the right one. Chauvinism has been very often evident in the chocolate debate..(FR) The Brussels Committee Directive, concerning the approval of the addition of chocolate synthesis of a series of vegetable fats, cheaper than cocoa butter, apparently serves the interests of the five multinationals who are three -quarters of the European market.	el
"So if one comes to the problems of the new knowledge -based economy, the new digital economy - which, as far as I know, has only produced unemployment instead of employment instead of employment - it is quite legitimate to ask whether the inability to deal with the current problems of unemployment, a largely phrase -rich explanation on the employment problems of the future ... nobody understands all of us, the internet, digital economy, the digital industry,And play the knowledge -based economy, but these were not the original goals of the employment summit.Mr. President, you closed with a slightly ideological tone, and that was a good thing.If the social democratic policy looks for the economy of the future, then I have to remind you that one of the most serious problems in relation to the internet-supported economy and the deficit of Europe is the lack of entrepreneurship that can be determined in the education system, in the actions of the governments and in the work of the institutions.And it has to proceed against this to guarantee the knowledge -based economy of the future.Mr. President!First of all, I would like to welcome you in the European Parliament, especially because with your visit you have already pointed out the symbolic, whereupon the chairman of the Group of the Social Democratic Party of Europe has already pointed out, that it is politically symbolic if you have also come to the capitals during your tour to hear the European Parliament.It is not for the first time that there is a different and politically invigorating relationship between council and parliament during the Portuguese presidency.However, as Comrade Barón Crespo has found, this is indeed a significant gesture, which we also like to take note of as such.Our attitude is clear: We support the initiative of the Portuguese government because it is serious and because we identify with the content, the strategic as well as the other goals.This is also very clear in the way this Council is prepared.On the one hand, the seriousness and thoroughness of the document presented in January.Then the individual preparatory conferences, the contribution that both entrepreneurs and trade unionists make for this summit.And above all, the latest contribution in the research area, which was made at the conference, on which Nobel Prize winners and Minister of Science and Technology came together.Here seriousness becomes visible, here an interest in the content of the summit preparation is visible.However, we also support the initiative in relation to the main goal already mentioned here, because it is not only the topic of employment and social issues for the first time again at the center of the European debate, but because it is again considered possible to ""achieve the goal of full employment"".For years, many said that this would be impossible that this would not be possible again in the new companies.I congratulate you, Mr. President, to put this topic back on the agenda without denying social cohesion and fundamental values ​​for us.These values ​​are not only the basis of the founding project of the European Union, but also the basis of our culture and, above all, our view of the extent of the solidarity required between all Europeans."	de
Mr President, Article 3b of the Maastricht Treaty, still limits the principle of subsidiarity to the relationship between the European Union and its Member States. Areas and stateless nations are ignored. Therefore, people suffer in their own communities. They are unable to create the structures they need so that human rights can flourish and the scourge of racism can be removed forever. For example, in my nation, Wales, we have no authority to introduce our own laws to combat racism and defend human rights. The principle of cohesion and the relief of poverty and disadvantage in our communities are deeply rooted in the European Union. However, they must include respect for minorities everywhere so that they will inspire the whole world to combat racism and defend human rights. Corner thanks to the reporters of the report for their work they did. Actions need to follow our words more and more. Missing human rights respect, racism, alien liability and anti -Semitism do not only live in other continents, but also live in us, our lives and in our institutions. Racist and anti -alien statements are also presented in this Parliament. We need to get started in ourselves to achieve a world where everyone can help to another. In countries who prohibit the existence of human and social rights, Kurdish, Palestinians and Chechen rights to the rights of Afghans, we may have a greater impact if our practices do not have hypocrisy. There are numerous Haiders in Europe. In a case that happened in Rome last week - and I only give a small example in Rome - when the mayor's consent, the Bosnian Roma was expelled without distinction and driven them without help in crisis areas and separated children and mothers, brothers and sisters;They were driven away without even giving them a time to bring anything with them, and children born in Italy were taken out of the school who had already integrated in the country and whose classmates liked them. You can call a Haider when in Rome, the opposition parties in Rome and the new center also encourage people's anger and prevent the municipality from giving Roma in safe places with water and light. I say this without allowing any illegal use by Roma or migrants either. I would like to be able to feel the same with everyone that no one in our corn is a foreigner. For this reason, I am particularly in favor of the proposals in resolutions: give power and help to all those who support the culture of life together and citizenship. Mr President, I would like to focus first and foremost on some individual aspects that are included in Belder's report, which is a good analysis of the current situation of the candidate states. We should avoid - and this has already been said - to give the impression that we require these candidates to comply with stricter demands than ourselves. We are not allowed to compare the real situation there with our perfect legislative texts, but to our own reality, because otherwise the candidates would always be in a worse position. It is probably undeniable that, for example, applicants who have recently recently recently have recently recovered their independence, such as Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, is the right to first redefine and then structure their own national identity. Because of course, because of the past communist dictatorship, the pluralistic conversation culture is of course not popular, many of the manifestations of national identity have seemed exaggerated or even indirectly against minority of our own country or some neighborhood states. We should not condemn these phenomena by looking at the morality along the nose as long as the phenomena are temporary and occur on the way to defining our own identity. However, we should, however, provide concrete assistance to these EU membership states, which is necessary to find the necessary finding of our own identity as a result that these states negatively make a difference in nesting or neighbors. I would like to mention the situation between Estonia and Latvia as an example of the positive development between the two population groups.	fi
I finish.I will not extend more: we will have the opportunity at other times.But, it goes without saying, as one of the speakers pointed out and I thank you all for your completely positive and relevant interventions, which we cannot allow ourselves to say again, in one, two or three years, that we have not done what we should.For my part, I can assure you, after having discussed it within the college of commissioners, that the Commission is willing to present in Parliament and to the Council the legislative measures, the modifications and the directives necessary to provide us with the highest security levels.The political will of this Parliament is necessary and I note that I can count on this will, as is that of the Council of Ministers.Thank you, Madam Commissioner.We have taken note of your availability.I have received 8 resolution proposals, filed on the basis of article 37, paragraph 2, of the regulation, to close this declaration of the commission.The debate is closed.The vote will take place Thursday at 12 noon.Storms in Europe The agenda calls for the declaration of the Commission on storms in Europe.The floor is to Mr. Barnier, on behalf of the Commission.Mr. Commissioner, I want to thank you for the words you have made, in particular for the completely concrete proposals concerning the victims who expect a lot from the European Union, from the aid that we can bring them.Personally, I sent you, in the first days which followed this terrible storm, a letter to ask you to request French authorities a readjustment of the perimeters of the objective 2, so that all the areas disaster by storms, both in France and elsewhere, can benefit from the objective 2. I think that it was done because you did not speak about it.We all know that if you are not in a perimeter of objective 2, you will have all the difficulties of the world in obtaining aid.So, it is better to remedy this problem right away.You also know that the problem is not just in the short term, but also in the medium and long term.I explain myself.I was present in Lorraine during this terrible storm which ravaged around 20 % of the Feuillus forest.Indeed, for certain so -called forest municipalities which are affected at 20 %, this represents an enormous loss.We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to mature.The loss that these municipalities will be undergone will therefore not spread over a year, two years, five years, but on much more.The municipalities concerned estimate that it will spread over 40 years.I therefore think that it will be really very difficult to compensate for losses in terms of financial return of these rural communities by subsidies.I believe that it is an aspect to engrave in our memories so as not to forget it in our different policies.	fr
It must be emphasized that the creation of Europol is one step ahead, but now the next step has to be taken by strengthening legal cooperation in criminal matters in order to increase the development of a genuine European legal region that would meet the goal of freedom, justice and safety. This Convention is therefore aimed at supplementing and facilitating the application of previously existing, which is related to other sectors of the judiciary in the Member States in order to improve legal cooperation in criminal matters through both effective and fast legal aid. However, it clearly respects the basic defense rights and the general principles of human rights that have been confirmed in the judiciary of each Member State and the European Convention on Human Rights. Caution on rights, freedoms, and key protection made us support the removal of the text point, which dealt with the eavesdropping of the phone and recommend that the Council propose a separate legal instrument that would respond to this problem. In the case of video negotiations, a more detailed regulation must be created in order to ensure defense rights and legal protection. The nature of the legal system of the legal system must definitely be respected, and the rights must be defended ... (President interrupts the speaker. Are we safe if the freedoms are no longer guaranteed? Are we still free if safety is no longer guaranteed? The whole soul of modern criminal justice is seeking balance, a dialogue between the necessities of safety and the necessities of freedom. And this dialogue never ends. It adapts to modern demands. Today, certain forms of crime crosses the boundaries and, of course, the advantage of Member States is to work better in cooperation to combat them. However, the sketch of the Council is not satisfactory. Much significant criticism can be made against it. First of all, with regard to form: there are many inaccuracies in the draft general agreement that in no way fit with the legal protection objective of a modern society. This exceeds style questions. These are criminal matters and criminal matters must be severely interpreted. Secondly, in terms of content: The Council's draft avoids the obvious difficulties that are related to the great difference between our legal systems, the diversity of practices, and the complete lack of the quality of public service standards in certain Member States of the Union. It provides (Article 9) to transfer prisoners from one Member State to another, even though the warranties are not the same. I want to emphasize this point because it is essential. It should be remembered that tens of thousands of persons are now arrested in the European Union without judgment, and that in certain Member States, arrest is misused as a means of gaining recognition. This is real legal torture. In other European countries, on the other hand, recognition is not considered sufficient evidence of guilt. Thus, this diversity of criminal justice policies must be encountered, and the correct legislative legislation means trying to develop real criteria for legal convergence, but it also gives the opportunity to face reality in European prisons, which often have too many prisoners: they are unauthorized places and do not meet the image of ourselves. Mr President, good colleagues, you have known for a long time that all our countries have overturned the death penalty, but I assure you that almost a thousand people in prisons commit suicide each year, and thus these countries have not actually been able to overtake it. Mr President, Legal Cooperation is of course central to Europe, but it must be implemented in absolutely respect for the principles that our society is based on: human rights and basic human freedoms determined by the European Convention on Human Rights and Basic Freight. We can only thank the Parliament Committee, which, by several of the reviews, has depthly changed the report that it now offers more guarantees, because as it was originally presented, it did not convince us at all. I would like to emphasize a member of the Parliament to Schultz that we will never submit reviews in the name of a particular member of the Parliament or because of personal influences, but within the general political interest.	fi
Incidentally, in this situation, the political of the European Union has a high level of responsibility.Of course we have to adjust these systems.Especially in France, one has to stop taking up the financing of health insurance and pensions to the labor market alone.Furthermore, the archaic administration mode must be reformed, which represents a source of injustices, mismanagement and waste.In particular, we have to pursue family policy geared towards demographic growth, a economic, monetary and tax policy aimed at growth and reconquest of our internal market, which contributes to the creation of jobs.The commission's proposals and the report Andersson have nothing to do with social policy, but they are an instrument that gives Brussels excessive decision -making powers regarding financing, i.e. the organization and services of the social protection systems of the European nations.For this reason, we voted against this text.Social protection must primarily be an expression of national solidarity, and it is primarily and exclusively the responsibility of the nation states.Social protection must be based on the principle of national and common preference.Otherwise, he only serves the financial regulation of unbearable social conditions that represent a consequence of immigration, at the expense and to the damage of European citizens.We did not participate in the vote on the report by Jan Andersson on a concerted strategy for modernizing social protection.Our basic attitude to the European Union is positive.As Swedish liberals, we consider European integration as a possibility of solving cross -border problems, such as:B. questions of the environment, trade, international mobility, human rights and conflict resolution.Here the democracies of Europe in the world can show that cooperation leads to peace and prosperity.But we also believe in the principle of subsidiarity, i.e.h.that the decision must be taken as close to the person concerned as possible.For this reason, we actively work for a constitution of the European Union, from which the distribution of responsibilities is clearly visible to everyone.It must be absolutely clear to all citizens of the Union that the EU deals exclusively with the questions that it can best solve it - the cross -border problems.All other matters should be treated at local, regional or national level.Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU should only have a limited responsibility, except in cases that deal with the free mobility of people within the Union.Each Member State should have full responsibility and the right to self -determination for its social protection systems.Healthcare, childcare and geriatric care are clear examples of areas that are not directly borders.The same applies to employment policy.We do not consider a common European legal rules in these areas to solve the problems of the social security systems.It is important for us that the Union focuses on a few questions that can really be achieved.However, this does not prevent the Member States from working together and exchanging ideas in the social field.Social security and equality are traditionally high on the agenda of the liberals.That is why we can follow many of the proposals raised in the Anderson report at the national level without reservation.	de
So there are serious reasons, in addition to justice among the genders, who argue in the distribution of public office, as well as political and economic power in a fair and balanced way between men and women. The whole life of women is intertwined with the offering and protection of life and the environment, with dialogue, reconciliation, understanding of different views, resolving differences by peaceful means. These values ​​of women can be an alternative to modern culture of violence and establish a new political culture and a fairer and prosperous society for all. For this reason, there is a need for the intergovernmental conference to introduce the New Treaty the principle of balanced participation of women and men in the composition of all the institutions of the European Union and in all democratic institutions and political decisions in all Member States of the Community. Mr President, why should women be given an equal participation in political decision -making? And how do we achieve this? We do not disagree about the need to do so. It is a matter of justice and democracy, so it is a prerequisite for political legitimacy. However, when we wonder how this goal will be achieved, we see that views are divergent. Is it enough to inform, educate and ensure the practical conditions or should we impose preferential treatment, such as quotas on political parties? Is it the responsibility of the state, that is to say, to impose such terms on political parties? Or should we force 50% of the seats on elected organs to be given? This debate, which is being held in some parts of Europe, but also here in parliament with the French slogan about Pariti, is essentially the very basis of the democratic system, as well as the political importance we want to give to the woman. I believe that the political struggle should be conducted on the basis of political ideas and not the gender of people. I am in favor of voluntary quotas on the ballots, without which I wouldn't be here today. Just like Mrs. Van Lancker, I am also a product of such a measure. However, I believe that the state cannot and should not be mixed with imposition measures in the internal processes of political parties; this can irreparably hurt democracy. In other words, the means we use to help women understand the position that really attributes them to the democratic system should not lead to a gender apartheid system. This would be at the expense of democracy. Pt) Mr President, I would like to express my gratitude for the so -called estimates, approaches and placements expressed in this parliament. There was more discussion than the issues that arose, we had an interpretation of the topic of discussion. We unanimously admit that in order to deepen democracy it is necessary for women to have more powers and to be involved in decision -making. This assumption was unanimous. The divergences that occurred were how to achieve this goal.	el
So if you want to give any lessons, they are in good hands in this high house.She knows me well enough to know that in all phases of our five -year collaboration in this house there was not once that I would not have provided information about everything I did, comprehensive, officially and detailed.Mr President, allow me first, the careful and, as I came up, sacrificing work by Mr. van Hulten to prepare for this report.Although he has not belonged to this house for long, he is already an old hare in many ways, as a former civil servant in his familiarity with the institutions, and I think that this preference is demonstrated by his ability to tackle this difficult topic that - as several MPs have carried out - is of crucial importance for all of our institutions.I thank him and wish him a long and successful MP ​​career.As you know, the Van Hulten report had to be very long for the second report of the committee of independent experts, and since I would like to give this a comprehensive answer, especially in connection with the problem of financial management and control, I would like to ask you now.Of course, I will not take the time of the MPs longer than absolutely necessary.When the second report of the committee of independent experts was discussed in front of this high house last September, on behalf of the new Commission, I assured that the report would serve as an essential template for the proposals for reforming the Commission.The high house will recognize what efforts we take to complete implement this assurance as soon as it deals with the reform package, which is now quite well in the demanding schedule that we had said goodbye to the demanding schedule.I am sure that Mr. Pomez Ruiz finds that encouraging.The vast majority of the proposals contained in the paper are very similar to those of Mr. Van Hulten, and contains this paper - I and Mr. Staes - to say that an extremely exact schedule for the actions to be carried out in the course of the reform.For this reason, the report that I had the honor has no unexplained or ambivalent positions.The opinion of this parliament will be of great importance in the coming four to five-week consultation period for obvious reasons.I would like to reply Mr. Elles that we are definitely in reception mode.However, he will certainly recognize with the usual generosity that the prerequisite for the fact that we can at all accept a reaction to our suggestions must first send our suggestions.Hence the transmission.Due to time constraints, it is not possible for me to discuss all the components of the decision -making application in front of the Hohen house, but I would be happy to assure you that the details are treated as an important training for our reform proposals throughout the advisory period and of course for our work in other important areas.I now turn to the most important topics of the motion for resolution and would like to attach the following comments.	de
"So we will create a cooperative climate that has a positive effect on the quality of the reform.The representatives of the parliament at the government conference have to make it clear to the negotiating partners that we also take responsibility for their constitutional development with the institutional changes in the Union.You should therefore be aware that such questions can not only be decided by haggling.The topics of this government conference are extremely delicate.It may be easy to formulate solutions, but the question is to what extent these solutions can withstand history.I refer to two possible points of conflict.On the one hand, we have the previously preserved balance between large and small countries.Europe is not a classic federal state and can not become anyone.The solutions we have to be decided must submit to the basic concept of the European Union, which is a Union of the states and a Union of the peoples.The other field on which tensions can arise is even more complicated.In view of the upcoming admission of new members, we are calling for more efficient working organs from the future European Union.This means that you have to work easier and faster.However, the European Union is and remains a complex and complicated multi -state institution per se.There are certainly options for tightening and simplification, but there are also limits here.If we overthrow the goal in favor of one -sided efficiency, then the legitimation of the European Union is questioned.However, I am confident.Mr. President, the mandate of the government conference must be expanded.The most important question that needs to be added is the inner differentiation of the Union.Unfortunately, the European Parliament has not yet dealt with it at all, but this is necessary so that the Union can be expanded in the agreed manner.Former Commission President Jacques Delors has again publicly brought up the idea of ​​the European Confederation and also referred to the fact that the avant-garde countries at the top of the association should progress faster than others and that they should establish clarity for their own institutions.The current Commission President Prodi and the High Representative Solana have commented in a similar way.The faction of the liberal and democratic party of Europe positioned itself in the statement on internal differentiation that was assumed last November and proposed a system of concentric circles for Europe, the ""onion model"".In the next decision to the government conference, the parliament should really deal closely with the question of differentiation and flexibility.If we do not succeed in creating the system proposed by the liberal faction, both the expansion and integration are at stake.My colleagues, Ms. Frassoni and Mr. Onesta have already expressed a little skeptical about some aspects of the topic that we are currently advising.I would like to add a word of concern about the question of subsidiarity not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Member States and their own autonomous regions.So far, this has not been duly taken into account, although there are many things to worry here.I would particularly like to deal with one of the effects of the expansion in relation to this parliament.The upper limit was determined that this parliament may include a maximum of 700 MPs so that it can continue to do justice to the role of the role of an advisory meeting."	de
Thank you, Mr. Medina Ortega.I completely share the regrets you express.Would you have the kindness to write to me so that I can, proof to support, seize the competent authorities both of Air France and also of the French government?I believe that, really, it is no longer possible and it is absolutely necessary that we protest in the most energetic way.Madam President, I had the same experience yesterday as Mr. Medina Ortega.I think that the French authorities - who have the honor of welcoming the headquarters of the European Parliament to Strasbourg - must become aware of their responsibility to guarantee adequate links with all the Union capitals.Absolutely, Mr. Napolitano, thank you.Madam President, this is not a question here of aircraft delays: I would like to excuse the absence yesterday of my colleague from the Green Group, Caroline Lucas, who is British deputy.She could not be present, because she was arrested during an anti -nuclear demonstration in Glasgow yesterday morning.Her identity was noted: it appeared very clearly that she is a European deputy, it was nevertheless kept in detention all day.I believe that it is absolutely unacceptable and I will ask you - I also wrote to you with my colleague Ms. Hautala on this subject - to intervene with the British authorities so that such facts are no longer represented and so that excuses are presented to Ms. Lucas.Thank you, Mr. Lannoye.I have received your letter and I have already intervened with the British performance.Madam President, with regard to today's vote, I would like to ask for something that I have already addressed yesterday, during the oral debate on the Equal report.I request a postponement of the vote on the Equal initiative, because we simply still need a little time to settle an important point.I am optimistic and I really plan to vote with serenity and confidence;We will find such a wide agreement as possible for this position on Equal.We only need a little time to settle the details on the question of asylum and I therefore ask to vote tomorrow rather than today.Madam President, to follow up on the point raised by Mr. Lannoye: Mrs. Lucas was arrested outside Glasgow for demonstrating against the trident base located in Faslane.I have a lot of sympathy for this event.However, I do not have any sympathy for the fact that Mrs. Lucas tries to hide behind her parliamentary immunity.For my part, I was also arrested for demonstrating in Faslane.I did not entrenched myself behind my immunity.I accepted the sanction that was applied to me.Ms. Lucas should do the same.Madam President, I would like to come back to Ms. Stenzel's request to postpone the vote on the Equal Community initiative tomorrow.Indeed, this initiative has been the subject of a fairly animated discussion within the Commission and, since it is an important proposal from the Commission which relates to the agreements arrested last year, I think it is acceptable.We join Ms. Stenzel on the fact that the request for dismissal is justified in order to find the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that the Parliament expresses the widest possible majority, her position on this initiative.	fr
During last fall already, we heard Mr. Bernard Kouchner claim police forces.I am satisfied to hear that Mr. Javier Solana will bring together the interior ministers next weekend to discuss the question of police action.I hope that this discussion will first focus on Kosovo, so that we can offer a remedy for this desperate situation.Still with regard to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will follow up on the wish expressed by the Parliament - and if I am not mistaken, also by the Commission - to see defined over several years a budget devoted to action in Kosovo.Mr. Solana, the events of Kosovo have brought us several lessons: we have learned, for example, the need, to deal with crises, to endow a military capacity that we have already used concretely.But it is advisable to learn another just as important lesson: namely that it is better to prevent crises, rather than being forced to intervene afterwards.The EU therefore also needs an independent and credible capacity in terms of conflict prevention.With regard to the Commission, Commissioner Patten has already taken several laudable initiatives in this direction.I am thinking of the proposal which would consist in setting up a rapid reaction FACILITY and a RAPID REACTION Force for non -military actions, as well as to create goals headlines for non -military actions and a CRISIS Center commission.The last question I would like to send to Mr. Javier Solana is the following: what concrete preparatory work has been carried out in this area of ​​conflict prevention?How were they organized in Mr. Solana's service, and how were they coordinated with the work of the Commission?Mr. President, Mr. Solana, you have the whole support and confidence of the Liberal group, but we want to remind you of the huge responsibility that now rests on your shoulders.Among other things, I think of humanitarian operations, recovery and peacekeeping.But I also think of responsibility, ² which is now yours, to ensure that the new European cooperation in defense does not create the slightest division between NATO and the EU, nor between the USA and Europe.Such a division would only rejoice the despots and rebel states that threaten freedom and human rights.You have, I think, heard the concerns expressed last week in front of our parliament by some members of the US Congress.You must ward off these concerns, Mr. Solana because, as you said yourself, if we are united on both sides of the Atlantic, we can do something.If we divide, we weaken ourselves and thus lengthen the sufferings of the oppressed.From then on, Mr. Solana, maintain the narrowest contacts with our American allies, without forgetting Norway, Turkey and Canada.It is also to a large extent thanks to them that we will not become paper tigers.We have, Mr. George Robertson often said, two million soldiers, but we couldn't even align 40,000 in Kosovo.It is perhaps our weakness and our lack of credibility that led to war.	fr
First of all, I want to say that there is a very big difference between production e.g.cars, or trucks and film production. We know that film production is dependent on financial support, because it is a combination of cultural element and commercial production. We also know that European cinema, especially the one that is produced in the least widespread languages, finds it difficult to maintain a desired, great production of films. For this reason, both the national and European financial support of the films are very important, as well as the possibilities that the practice will continue to be accepted by up to 50% state financial support. However, I would like to ask the Council spokesman if he does not consider it to be important, in this way and using this practice to provide a 50% financial support for the production of European cinema films in less widespread languages. MPs, taking into account the situation you referred to in the smaller states of the Union, you will realize that I am particularly sensitive to this. This is an issue that concerns us too. It is obvious that, precisely because of the peculiarity of cultural diversity within the European Union, and because it is necessary to guarantee that this particular peculiarity leads us to transcend the exclusively economic conception of cinema industry, it has been given in the past. Hopefully, there will be the possibility of maintaining these aid, also hoping that they will in no way contradict the new rules of the World Trade Organization, which will be discussed specifically on the occasion of the new negotiations that we soon or later expect. At the moment, the maximum level of aid granted in the form of Community funding remains 50% of the total cost of each project, but the above percentage can be up to 60% for cases expressly provided for by the program. We have no indication at this time that the Commission is considering the possibility of lowering this level of funding, let alone at the amount and the percentage mentioned by the MP. Question No.8 of K. (H-0166/00): Subject: Citizens' Information The Council can draw a list of parties that electors can vote without their country at risk of being ostracized? It is obvious, Mr President, that it does not fall under the responsibilities of the Union to intervene in procedures related to the constitutional order of the Member States, as well as it is not the responsibility of the Union to draw up one, let's say, a positive list of parties that electors can vote. If we were starting to deal with such issues, we would really slip into dangerous situations. This does not mean that behind the question does not submit a political meaning: in various countries, such as for example, a Nazi party or a fascist party have no right to apply for recognition to a constitutional court. Thus, such parties are not accepted as legal parties active in democratic life. Other countries are applying different systems, and these countries are equally respected as mine.	el
The petition for more active public sector politics is very strange. It does not take into account Eurostat's latest information on accelerating inflation, which is already rising to 2 %, or the highest level. However, if someone wants higher public sector expenditure, he or she does not have to wait a long time for the European Central Bank's next interest rate increase. What the public sector can do by creating jobs will lose its importance because development is unfavorable, especially for small and medium -sized businesses. High unemployment in the European Union is causing all of us, especially now that the decline does not seem to continue. However, promoting employment is a long -term and structural policy. Special test The Member States' mission is to implement good policy. For that, they need to get a lot of room for maneuver. The stiffness brought about by social convergence criteria and other guidelines of the community certainly does not produce the desired increase in jobs. Transfer of taxation of taxation from taxation of work to the taxation of raw materials and minerals creates sustainability. Mr President, I would first like to express my satisfaction with the report presented by my colleague Giorgos Katifiis. I do not mean the report presented here today, but the report in the Committee on Economic and Financial and Industrial Policy, as it is two completely different reports from a political point of view. Very generally, we could say that the first report is a left -wing report that, in addition to financial problems, there is care for social issues;The report we have now received, which my colleague Giorgos Katphoris did not defend - where he did, in my opinion, has been crossed by a report that has removed key conclusions from the structure of social care since the structure of social care. What did Giorgos Katiforis, a member of the Parliament, suggested and what has been removed from the report? He proposed an ambitious report on optimistic Europe, which sought to set quantitative goals to obtain the results he pursued. Europe has just advanced by using methods of quantitative goals. For example, why was the proposal that the proportion of the European active population should rise to 75 % of the population, while the corresponding levels are now around 60 %? The 60 % of the active population is very low compared to the corresponding level in Japan or the United States and we are not able to in the same amount as these countries at such a low level of employment. So we need to increase the employment rate through competitive jobs. As presented for the Lisbon Summit, we must create a workforce that has scientific education to utilize new technologies. We also need to grow at faster pace. The idea of ​​a colleague von Wogau that we need the flexibility of labor is a very familiar statement. I would like to give him the opposite example of Portugal, where the work laws are not flexible, but where the unemployment rate is less than 5 % - and in recent years has been constantly declining - as investments are increasing (with the help of the community, of course) at a much faster pace. That's why we want a growing economy in Europe, which still takes care of the social side. Mr President, like many others, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the interest of the Katifias. As I read the report, I notice the picture of the EU economy it provided, and I think the picture is quite worrying. The level of investment is too low, there are far too many unemployed people and the growth is inadequate. Therefore, it is hardly any wonder that the euro continues to decline in relation to other currencies, despite the fact that a rumor is spread that the European Central Bank is buying secretly to support the euro. The rapporteur states that stability itself is not a goal I agree with. There is far too much talk about stability, approximation and coordination, but far too little about innovation and development. I think EMU collaboration is like a slow-moving giant that is difficult to stay with a very changing economy.	fi
Mr President, the Mr President of the Commission, the Members of the Commission, good colleagues, when drawing up new programs, we must not forget about previous programs that are in the implementation phase. From this point of view, it is useful that the Commission's work program returns to issues of Agenda 2000, a common agricultural policy, which also includes fishing, and secondly to the operation of the Structural Funds. Mr President of the Commission, I hope this means that the current Commission's reorganization does not interfere with the control and implementation mechanism created for Agenda 2000. Of course, Agenda 2000 issues are related to your third and fourth strategic goal, economic and social agenda and higher quality of life. However, your texts do not show to the extent to which large and high -flying goals are at odds with the tools that the Commission intends to activate. And I do not necessarily mean financial tools. In the end, the agricultural industry in the agricultural sector may not require any more financial tools. You also have to save. However, these are analytical tools;Placing the spiritual capital on these questions. It is imperative that two goals are achieved: a diverse European model in agriculture must be safeguarded, and this must be done in a way that facilitates world trade in agricultural products and, above all, favors developing countries. These two goals are not easy to reconcile. The solution is not easily found. These two goals may be contradictory, there is nothing that would indicate that the Commission has noted this contradiction and intend to address it. The chairmen of the Commission, the other side of the agenda, ie cohesion and regional development, can certainly present great achievements, but there are still behind the areas, especially the archipelago areas that need more attention. With regard to fishing, I would say that at any point your program does not say that robbery fishing that has even destroyed whole fish species should come to some sort of outcome in the future. More attention should be paid to these things, and more is needed Esprit de Finesse (depth). Mr President, I want to start by emphasizing the caution that many colleagues have emphasized here when talking about this five -year plan. When we set very ambitious long -term goals, we must not ignore the present. Poettering, the leader of my group, highlighted it very well in his opening speech. The Union may not adopt a number of new activities for itself unless it is based on a successful European economy. This is clearly the foundation of the uniform market. How, then, are the strong uniform markets at the moment? I want to remind the chairman Prod and his colleagues who are still present, the results of the 3,000 European companies covered by the Commission. Almost 40 % of the companies involved in the survey still incur additional costs for making their products or services in accordance with national guidelines. This is the result of the Commission's own survey. These are classic symptoms of the creation of national governments - a bureaucratic paper war prevents access to market. The Commission's program is embarrassingly complaining about the completion of the internal market. We need to continue pressure in all areas by eliminating more obstacles, more effectively by pressure from Member States that do not implement uniform market activities and, of course, extend the uniform market to new important areas, such as financial services. Only if we have a strong foundation in the uniform market, we can successfully implement the agenda for expansion. The expanded Europe must be built on the current strengths of the Union. The union cohesive market for the entire expanded Union will be a huge achievement. I quit by saying for all my conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in Parliament - that we will give our full support to the Commission and Chairman Prod in this historic mission. Mr President, the Mr President of the Commission, good colleagues, as we give you a statement of confidence at the same time with you about today's meeting. Just today we are getting to the actual thing, because today we will take a stand on your program.	fi
During the budget procedure, we were told that the funds for Kosovo would have to be approved quickly, and now it is the case that no tenders have so far been published or carried out.This is serious, because this delays the entire process of reconstruction in Kosovo.Finally, and that is the logical conclusion of my explanations, we ask the Commission to inform the budget committee regularly, monthly, about the statement of execution of the expenses.We have documents in which there is talk of fixed middle bonds.We do not need fixed middle bonds, we simply need medium -sized bonds, and we have to know what has actually been paid and, above all, what has not been paid.The Kosovo suffered enough from paying delays.President!When we talk about Kosovo today, which we have done many times, we should also take account of what has already been done in Kosovo or whether something has already been done.I mean, there are already a few small steps on the way to normal, and you would like to list them at least once as part of such a debate.From February 9th there will be a so -called interim council - he is called Kosovo Transitional Council - in which both the political parties, both the minorities and the Civil Society are represented and which should be an interim parliament.This is good, we welcome that, but I think you also have to give them an instrument and a strategy planning for what they should actually prepare, because elections are planned in autumn.Nobody really knows what these elections should lead to what a parliament should become of it.Nobody knows what powers of this parliament should have compared to the Unmik.This means that these are a lot of imponderables that we are not informed about and the other probably cannot classify correctly.Exactly the Albanians who are now integrated in this interim country, should actually have a little more idea of ​​what awaits them.In addition to the economic work, in addition to reconstruction, it must also be remembered to produce the coexistence of the Serbs, the Albanians and other minorities - including the Roma - in this country so that the way of coexistence can hopefully be reconciliation at some point.I want to list again what actual things already exist that we can look forward to.There are now 34 tax inspectors in the area of ​​administration.This is something great!People are now encouraged to pay their taxes there too, because in the long run it cannot be the case that everyone only depends on the sack of the EU and other donors;A bit must also come from your own possibilities in this area.It must also be determined that 4 of the 19 departments already have 4 administrative lines, which is also progress for what we have had there so far.We also have something that is very important for the rule of law that we want to build.We have 130 judges and prosecutors who are now sworn in who can take on their work in order to speak right there in order to also enrich the culture of tolerance there and of course also to be able to track down the crimes and then also be able to express convictions.	de
"I admit, Mr President, that he is particularly displeased that this proposal is not voted on today; every minute he passes he could actually lead us dramatically to a conflict that we must avoid. Already in the previous Session I had asked for the issue to be discussed and it was surprised by a month without the friends of socialists agreeing with us to a proposal, which is perfectly reasonable, since we share its fundamental bases. However, I also realize that it is important to have the widest possible consensus to give our young people a strong support base. So I ask to ensure that there will be no other time unnecessarily, because I would not want to happen to us once again, as in other previous cases, to say what we need to preserve peace when the war has already erupted. Mr Buttiglione, by summarizing what you have said, I think you are confirming the memoir of your team that has arrived in the bureau, with which you are seeking to withdraw this resolution, a request, which was also made by Mr. NAOR. But we continue the debate, regardless of what is going to happen in the next April session, which I hope will move towards the political will you both here. Therefore, we continue the discussion and the resolutions are withdrawn. Mr President, I am very sorry that the vote will not take place now. I am worried, like the other speakers, about the difficult situation of people in Iraq. We must not forget that the misery of the Iraqi people is due to their own government. We must also not forget that in January this year, Parliament approved a resolution by asking Iraq to release the Crucifixions of the Crucifixions of War, who are still imprisoned in Iraq, or at least to inform their families and their families. However, nothing has happened and our message in Iraq, and of course to the people of Kuwait, must be quite clear that we in Europe will not forget or ignore the difficult situation of those who are abusive in Iraq. We want this message to be as powerful as possible, clear and categorical as possible. Mr President, the United Nations sanctions have become a weapon of mass destruction and are responsible for the deaths of at least 200 children per day. Dennis Haliday, who resigned from the position of UN Humanitarian Mission in Iraq, thus protesting for sanctions, confirms UNICEF statistics that five to six thousand children die each month as a direct consequence of sanctions. Mary Robinson, UN Human Rights High Commissioner for Human Rights, is open to sanctions imposed in violation of international law, which prohibits, as a war method, the famine of citizens. He says: ""How do you expect to condemn human rights violations in Algeria, China or elsewhere when the United Nations itself is responsible for the situation in Iraq?""Due to the economic sanctions of the United Nations, Iraqis cannot introduce spare parts for the restoration of infrastructure, making infectious diseases transmitted with water and air uncontrollable."	el
"And here is our difference to the Council, which simply speaks of an contribution. But this contribution may be half a euro, and that, but God, would be very little in this case. That would change nothing. There is no financial pressure for ships to behave accordingly. What is needed is a fixed amount of waste disposal for all ships, regardless of the actual use of waste receipt facilities. This means that the financial incentive for rejection at sea should be abolished, which - as it was already clarified - has been possible in the Baltic with the Helsinki Committee Agreement, with the system that does not impose specific fees. What is possible there must be able to work for the other European seas. Because it's not just about the environment, it's clear waters, it is even tourism and - what is crucial - besides the environmental issue, it is still the neutrality of competition. All ships in the ports should be able to meet the same conditions, and only if the Parliament, the Commission and the Council will jointly create these conditions will have restored this neutrality of competition for ports and ships. I believe that this is still the credibility of the Union and Parliament in particular. I believe that people were tired of experiencing this hypocritical behavior of Europe and its ministers after each destruction, as we saw in the case of ""Erika"". The oil reaches the coasts, and then the ministers appear and they make the same efforts to remove the pollutants with a small bucket, but after two weeks there are a strict directive under discussion, then the big words of yesterday have been forgotten. We will not be able to prevent one hundred percent accidents, but we can customize prevention as best as possible. A consistent directive will be an important step in this direction. I still hope that the colleagues of the Liberal Team will perhaps re -consider the issue until tomorrow, even if - even for reasons of identifying with parliament - they can once again work together, as they have already done at first reading because we will go there anyway. I think that for reasons related to the environment and competition, but also based on what was decided just two months ago, in January, we would have to vote for a large majority of these amendments tomorrow, just as we discussed them in the Commission. Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, Mr Rapporteur, I wish you good luck in your report. And you have already said this: We need this directive a lot. It's a good directive. Ports must have waste receipt facilities. And eventually there will be a check. Member States must also impose sanctions if one does not comply with the rules. This is especially important. It is very good for the environment. In this area, investments are already being made before the position of the directive such as, for example, in Antwerp, near which I live, where large facilities are currently being constructed, which did not exist."	el
"Those men paid for their democratic efforts with their lives. I have considered it important to condemn very strongly the shameful and cruel act to any civilization state. The rule of law and respect for fundamental rights and freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based. All forms of terrorism are condemning. I hope those men remained the last victims of Eta and I urge that organization to end the use of violence and to resort to the current Democratic means of Spain. Dear colleagues, I urge you to spend a minute of silence Fernando Bulesa Blancon and Jorge Díez Elorza.(Parliament spent a minute of silence.) Mr President, above all, I would like to thank you for the statement you made on behalf of the European Socialist Party last Tuesday and for the words you just said in memory of Fernando Bulesa Blanco. He was a member of the Regional Parliament, a horn of the Socialist Group of the Basque Regional Parliament. He had been Vicelendakari, Vice Chairman of the Basque Board. The Mr President, the best tribute to which my group and this parliament can give to Fernando Bules, is to recall how he described his European view of the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. In his autobiography, he says, ""We live in Europe. All my 54-year-olds can remember their grandparents and the time they lived, the time when our parents lived, modern, and they can also predict how our children will come to life. There is only one currency from one place than our grandparents, we are going to build a large European area. But it is very real, and it should make us question some of our own reality. In a conversation in a socialist party concerned about the Irish peace process, someone said that in the end, the decisive factor in Ireland was that all parties concerned this issue: how important is Irish or English? Everyone must be able to be what they want, because if Ireland and English belong to the European Union, it is not worth killing each other because someone is Irish or English. What does it matter if national systems are no longer valid! Now we could ask the same question: how important it is to be a Basque, Spanish or European? We quench a lot about what being a Basque means, but nowadays the Basque dresses in the same way as the Danish and reads the same stuff as an Englishman. If we live in a much more international area in the future, we are already living in such a way and of course our children will live in such Europe, then why should we kill each other? Someone in Ireland may also have said this idea that if we kill each other in Ireland in vain, because each party had its own paramillated troops, we should also ask the same question in the Basque Country: What does it matter if there is any Basque? Be whatever you want. If we are going to work later in the European environment in the future of economic, politics and vital issues for each country, it is therefore not worth killing. Therefore, you should not kill or die."	fi
"At the beginning of the decade, we must predict the way in which our institutions will develop on an international level until the end of this same decade, and in particular what place we should occupy within the international monetary bodies, what place we should occupy within the United Nations organizations and so on.We have to open this debate.In conclusion, this morning, the day following Valentine's Day, the newspapers announce that your honeymoon is over.I don't know if you are romantic or not, Monsieur Prodi.Perhaps it is a very little romantic point for such a day.However, we congratulate ourselves within the group of liberals because we believe that it means, now, we have seriously set to work.It is in the order of things.Considering the many adjectival descriptions that you used with regard to Europe during your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe which has a human face and which is inclusive - allow me to define, in a word dear to the curled of my liberal colleagues, in two words, Europe that we want to see itself in your governance plan: a Europe of possible.Madam President, Mr. Chairman of the Commission, I have a lot of esteem for your franchise when you admit that the European Union must change at all.You think about major questions in principle in your program.I believe that citizens will start to be more interested in politics if we are able to raise big questions in addition to the daily small things.At the same time, it must be noted that your program unfortunately resembles in many reports to a party program.It indeed contains many good intentions, but the concrete proposals on the ways of making all this are largely lacking.Like any party program, it also contains several internal contradictions.By my intervention, I would like to help you detect these internal contradictions.First of all, economics and social development.You have to be able to think about how to reconcile the objective of competitiveness with the objective of full employment;This is therefore mentioned in your program.Should we finally predict a convergence criterion which - as you actually suggest in this program - would aim that in any Member State, unemployment will exceed, say the rate of the three countries that have best succeeded in this area?The ecological tax reform is what my group wants to underline.We cannot indeed create jobs and sustainable development by modifying the structure of taxation, but it is unfortunately - as we all know - of an area in which the European Union is quite unable to act.Please raise this question during the intergovernmental conference.The European Union can obtain its legitimacy only by focusing on the tasks that isolated countries cannot assume alone.Parliament surely defends with you the importance of supranational decision -making in this direction.An internal contradiction in your report is linked to globalization.I find that you have a lot of merit of raising the concept of ""global mastery"", as other people here have noted."	fr
The main objective of the announcement is double: on the one hand to explain in a clear and coherent way how the Commission implements, and intends to implement the principle of risk management and to present guidelines for its implementation on the basis of rational and coherent principles. We also hope that the announcement will help to form a better common perception of the way of risk management and to reject fears of possible use of the prophylaxis principle of arbitrary, or in order to convene commercial protectionism. The starting point of the Commission for the implementation of the precautionary principle is the need to ensure a high level of protection in the fields of environmental, health of humans and animals as well as in the planting sector. This goal cannot of course be used to justify irrational or arbitrary measures, but it does mean that measures can be taken even in cases where science does not provide clear answers. In this sense, while the principle of precaution is not about the politicization of science, as some claim, it really takes us to the crossroads of science and politics. The initial decision to implement the prophylaxis principle depends to a large extent on the level of the intended protection and the level of risk that is ready to accept the decision -making factors for society. This decision is therefore policy by nature. However, measures that may be taken below must obviously comply with the general principles in force for risk management, and therefore the guidelines for the implementation of the prophylaxis principle constitute the key element of the notice. The measures taken must be proportional to the selected level of protection - that is, we do not use heavy to break a nut. These measures must be free of discrimination in their application, that is, not differentiated based on geographical origin. They must also be according to similar measures already taken. For example, if a product has been approved, other similar products should be approved. The measures are based on examining the potential benefits and costs of action or lack of action, that is, measures must be effective in cost, subject to a revision in the light of new scientific elements, and clearly clarify who is responsible for providing the scientific elements that are necessary for the scientific elements. All of these elements must be applied cumulatively. It is also important to keep in mind that there is a wide range of measures that can be taken in the application of the precautionary principle, e.g. A survey program, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on. Therefore, the implementation of the prophylaxis principle does not automatically entail a prohibition. This announcement does not claim to be the last word on this subject. However, this is the first time the committee has been presenting a structured presentation of the Authority and its functional use. In a somewhat detailed way how the Commission implements, and intends to implement, the principle of precaution we hope to be able to clarify the situation at the Community level and contribute to the continued debate at European and international level.	el
We change the right so that it can be executed again;I don't find that acceptable.The Commission gives up its exemption monopoly.Against the background of this planned system of legal exception, competitive restrictions are easily released, provided that the requirements of Article 81 (3) EGV are met.There is no need for registrations in Brussels, which means that the commission will be on blind flight in the future in the future.I don't think this is acceptable.The concept of the Commission is supplemented by increased subsequent subsequent control of the national authorities and the courts of the Member States.Here, however, if this takes place as part of a renationalization, we will come to a competitive patchwork in Europe.I think this is not acceptable.A core of European politics is weakened here.The system change in European antitrust law, which is caught by the European Commission, is highly risky.We have enough other options in the existing system to secure open markets and free competition.Incidentally, the commission comes back to old suggestions with its proposal, which have already been submitted in the 1950s and 1960s.At that time there was no majority.Because France put the legal exception very much at the time at the time, it was compensated by concessions in agricultural policy.This proposal is now on the table forty years later, and - I am sure - it will create scope for antitrust formations at the expense of consumers in Europe.I don't think this is acceptable!Mr President, values ​​of colleagues, in this important pronunciation on competitive policy, I would like to say something this morning, especially on the report of Mr. Langen regarding the steel aid code.As the European Court of Justice recognized in 1996, the iron and steel industry is particularly susceptible to disorders of the competition.Incidentally, I came to this conclusion a few years ago in a report on the strengths and weaknesses of the European iron and steel industry.Therefore, it was quite legitimate to introduce a aid system for this sector, with the help of which the survival of powerful companies is to be guaranteed, even if there is an objection to Article 4 of the EC Treaty.This is exactly the concern of the sixth steel aid code.At the same time, however, it is important to avoid any violation of the competition regulations and any serious disorders of balance in the markets, and therefore these aid must be regulated.The state aid will continue to be limited to research, development, environmental protection and closure aids.In the same sense, it is primarily important that the Member States meet their duty to take account of the aid that they have granted their iron and steel companies before the Commission.The Commission suggests shortening the deadlines and I agree to this claim.Just like the rapporteur, I welcome the Commission's report, but regret that not all aspects of steel allowance are treated.Although the steel aid code is very clear, the Commission has approved aid to iron and steel companies that do not fall under the categories mentioned in the code.In the interest of equal treatment, the code must either be applied or changed.Finally, let me say, Mr. President that the regulations have to be revised with the expiry of the EGKS contract, because in my opinion the aid system must remain beyond 2002.That is why I am for a regulation of the council that guarantees security in this area.	de
"We need to set goals corresponding to the challenges we have to face and do not have much time, because, if we follow the committee's proposal and act with excessive deadlines, when the Commission itself and the Council have further extended the deadlines, we will not only face it, but we will be confronted with a problem with the public.indefinitely, as a result, the aim is not achieved. I insist at this point, because we should not wait for a nightmare to be published daily in our newspapers disasters to say: ""Ah, Europe did not, a, Europe would have to be"", and then to hurry to solve the problems we did not want to do. Today's example of the Danube, pollution caused in Romania, clearly shows that if we do not establish a new type of economic growth, clear demands, controls and specific measures for the state of our rivers, it is certain that such phenomena will not only be repeated, but will not only be repeated. We also know that if we do nothing, the development of our agriculture will continue to be done with great inequalities. Already today in my home country the rivers of Brittany are seriously affected by eutrophicism, which hurts tourism. I just want to conclude, Mr President, saying that the second reading clearly presents what is at stake. Do we want, yes or no, standards compatible with the OSPAR Convention, that is, almost zero levels of dangerous substances? Do we want to shorten the deadlines proposed by the Council for this directive? Do we want a price policy that gives all public and private participants the opportunity to take anti -pollution and act to save water? Do we seriously want to meet the expectations of our peoples? Most of the amendments approved by the Environment Committee respond to this goal, and I hope they are supported by parliament. Mr President, Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen, Mrs Lienemann presented us in a very immediate way how important water and air are to us, above all as key elements for the survival of people in general. Apart from the quality of the waters, it is also their quantity, as it is not sufficient in Europe, and especially in the areas where drought is prevalent. I am very sorry that the Commissioner, Mr. Wallstrfm, who is basically responsible for this issue, may not be present, as it is a highly important directive, in which the Commission has invested a lot of time. The legislation on the protection of the aquatic environment, for which we are discussing a second reading today, concerns all the citizens of the European Union, but also all the people in the states wishing to join it and will be obliged to fulfill the specifications required by the EU. A hearing raised and carried out by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994. From then until today's second reading many of the European Parliament participants, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers."	el
"We must prevent, adopt preventive measures in order to prevent this type of disaster from happening again.This is the meaning of the oral question that we have formulated in the name of all the deputies of the Fisheries Commission.We hope that the Commission will present concrete proposals: actions and not lamentations.The Parliament will now approve a proposal for a common resolution of several parliamentary groups, which I consider, Mr. President, ladies, very important and about.Mr. President, the sinking of the Erika on December 12 off the coast of the Breton coast caused a dark tide, the effects of which will be felt for many years.To the destruction of natural resources, we must add the serious impact of this disaster in certain economic sectors, fundamentally those which depend on fishing.The situation can still get worse with the 20,000 tonnes of gross that remain in the compartments of the stranded ship.For the aquiculture and oystering sectors, helpless in the face of pollution which has irreparably reached the coasts, the results were very serious from the first days and also thereafter, due to the loss of market share in these sectors and the rejection of the consumer of a guaranteed product but affected by this pollution.It is ladies and gentlemen, peripheral regions whose economic balance is unstable and which have been deeply affected by this dark tide which is unfortunately not an isolated fact.This region - including other neighboring regions - is mainly based on natural resources.Nature too often punished by human activities that could be avoided if the public authorities controlled them more.""Better to prevent than cure,"" it is said.The budget also says it.Ladies gentlemen, prevention measures are much less expensive than repairs to damage caused by disasters of this scale.Mr. Fischler says that he is present whenever Parliament calls it.However, in the Erika case, he gave the impression -perhaps not to us, but to the inhabitants of Brittany and Vendée -, as a fishing commissioner, not to be there or only partially.As Parliament has already pointed out during the first resolution of January 20, the needs of the fishing industries, oyster farming and tourism, must be taken into account as awarded sectors.This is why we asked the Commission to adopt urgent measures for the fishing sector, through the mobilization of specific funds.Galicia and Brittany, the two European Finistère have both seen themselves affected by these black tides.We do not understand how disasters such as Urquiola and Amoco Cadiz have not served as a lesson to strengthen legislation in the maritime transport sector both in terms of security control for the transport of dangerous products as well as pavilions of convenience.We ask that this time be the last.We ask that the lessons be learned and that we hurry to amend our legislation and fill the gaps that make us always faced with the incredible and that this incredible is nevertheless true.The principle of ""polluter pays"" seems not only necessary, but also justified."	fr
Created in March 1969, it must officially meet every two years, but in fact, it does it every year and makes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice.The organization then issues recommendations for stock conservation.The organization has four permanent committees, made up of national experts, covering the areas of research and statistics, finance and administration, respect as well as conservation and management measures.There are also four working groups for tropical tuna waters, the tuna of northern and southern temperate waters and the other species.These working groups are empowered to initiate regulatory measures with regard to species covered by the Convention.The proposals from these working groups are presented to the Commission, which then offers recommendations to the contracting parties.These recommendations are binding, but the contracting parties have a period of six months during which they can object.As a contracting party, the European Union is required to transpose such recommendations into Community law.During the session it held in November 1998, in Saint-Jacques-de-Compostelle, the Cicta recommended certain modifications of the rules relating to minimum landing sizes for red tuna.The Cicta also issued recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996. From now on, it is prohibited to land or sell red tuna 0, of course less than 1.8 kilos.During the November 1998 session, the Cicta's Standing Committee on Research and Statistics were asked to carry out a new assessment of the Red Tuna populations of the Western and Eastern Atlantic and the Mediterranean.The Committee would therefore provide organization with the information necessary to examine, develop and improve stock reconstruction plans.It was decided that the CPRS should present a study during the 1998 session, highlighting various possible scenarios of stock regeneration, at levels that can produce a lasting maximum return, taking into account the various possible levels of recruitment and mixing stocks.In addition, the study of the CPRS should indicate the monthly fences with the rotating seine, so that the fences are more effective for the conservation of the red tuna.Following this research, the session has agreed that, instead of overall prohibiting red tuna fishing at the rotating seine in the Mediterranean during the period from August 1 to 31, a more selective approach should be implemented.It is important to protect tuna fishing for future generation.The red tuna is the most expensive fish in the world since it would reach up to 90,000 euros per tonne for daily sales at the Triée de Tokyo and of course, the indication of the importance of Mediterranean tuna is that they represent 70 % of all landings in the region, estimated at almost 30,000 tonnes.On this quantity, 80 % are captured at the rotating Senne.The Mediterranean is an important frai area for red tuna, so that it is important to take the necessary measures to strengthen the protection of juveniles.We must respect the minimum size and that we implement the technical measures if we want to eliminate the capture of age 0. The measures adopted in November 1998 came into force on June 21, I repeated, on June 21, 1999, almost 9 months ago, several months before sending communication to the fishing committee.I believe, Mr. Commissioner, that it is not enough and that in the future, we will have to learn from it.	fr
"This calls into question the agreement in which the Parliament has been with great difficulty with the Council in December, whereby, when the Commission submits a multi -year program for rebuilding, we would in this case review the financial prospects. I call on Ministers here not to call into question this agreement that has been reached with truly difficulty. I would like to tell the Commission, with the pleasure of seeing Commissioner Solbes here this night, to submit to us this many years of funding program, along with the corresponding report, just as Parliament requested, so that we can take it into account when processing the draft of the next budget. Finally, I would like to insist that, although we have now granted 35 million, we know that this is a ""patch"" and that it is not enough, so we will have to reach an agreement as soon as possible for a multi -year reconstruction program, so necessary, for Kosovo. Mr President, colleagues, please forgive my delay but unfortunately today is still on the agenda and the other political issue. The Foreign Affairs Committee, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy recommends that you release € 35 million and this recommendation is based on the fact that these funds can indeed be allocated for the benefit of the affected. The reasons for a critical attitude is not serious enough to not want to help people there. This does not mean, however, that we will forget the criticism we should exercise. We would, of course, have gone far beyond this procedure, if the Board of Directors had not forgotten to inform the parliament in time and to officially forward the documents to him. Only in this way would it be possible to carry out a truly logical and in -depth consultation. I ask the administrative services to ensure that this is not repeated in the future only because of the affected people we are willing to overlook it and not take action. We must, however, make sure to introduce specific terms here. The first term is that the funds should be granted where they will be used reasonably and not where they might be used for targets other than those for which they were intended. This means that these funds should actually be made available in the field of jurisdiction of Mr Kouchner and not elsewhere. Second, even if the Commission and the Council in this case a different attitude, because they see realistic problems, we are of the opinion that other sponsors should fulfill the obligations they have committed. It is a mission under the United Nations and it is not possible for the European Union to fulfill its obligations. In the given period, the other sponsors should fulfill their obligations for the benefit of those affected. This pushes me to conclude that in the future we should generally deal with this issue much more intensively, and not only with the particular plan but with the overall evolution of the situation in Southeast Europe and the aid granted."	el
Flower mark is only one part of the broader environmental strategy needed to save our planet. Our citizens want concrete measures. They do not want politicians to just like fire speeches and thus only raise the temperature of the globe. By harnessing the flower power, we can all promote a cleaner, greener world. Blokland recommendation for second processing (A5-0056/2000).(EN) Member Blokland is quite correctly raising a number of serious concerns related to waste management, including waste incineration. I come from a country with more than 90 % landfills, so I agree to the conclusion that properly controlled waste incineration is not only necessary but also necessary. The Ireland government does not seem to have been seriously committed to waste recycling and sorting waste. The composting of waste and also organic waste must be the primary matter in all waste management strategies..(FR) The waste issue is a very interdimensional issue, and the lobbying of the industry is significant. Therefore, the European Union has approved the general strategy to address this great environmental and health challenge. The Directive we are discussing today is part of it because it aims to regulate the heat treatment of hazardous and harmless waste. I have to say that personally, I have always been concerned that the same legislation deals with both hazardous waste and harmless waste. I brought up my concern and question in the first discussion. The majority decided to support parallel burning, which does not satisfy me. That is why today I am struggling to take the measures that guarantee that the emission limits for hazardous waste will not be alleviated. Everyone knows that the amount of waste burning in the European Union is increasing.31 million tonnes of municipal waste were burned in 1990 and will increase to over 56 million this year. There are several reasons for this resulting from the increase in the amount of waste to be produced and the decrease in the amount of waste transported to landfills. However, it is known that incineration of waste causes pollution emissions, which seriously spoil the air, soil and water and are thus dangerous to health. The nature of the impurities that have entered the air depends on both the waste to be treated and the technology used to handle them. That is why we are concerned first and foremost about heavy metal, dioxin and furan emissions. In particular, the discussion has addressed parallel incineration plants. I remind you that these plants use hazardous waste as fuel in the production of energy or material substances. However, according to the applicable directives, the use of hazardous substances must be limited to 40 % of the amount of waste used. The percentage is too high! These institutions must be subject to very strict control rules, which must be as strict as the rules applicable to incineration plants. In addition, I would like to emphasize that while the use of hazardous waste is becoming more common, it must not lead to the fact that we get used to producing such waste. In fact, it may well happen that we will be told later that investments have been made to build parallel incineration plants and that they should now be supported! Already in advance, I strongly reject such views that lead to an increase in the amount of hazardous substances with all their environmental and security risks associated with them. Finally, it must be reminded that violations must be punishable and supported by communities that ensure that their incineration plants are in line with the rules, and it must be emphasized that our primary goal is and must still be preventing waste, regardless of whether the waste is dangerous or not..(EN) The European Union has in recent years been a pioneer in developing new waste management strategies. In fact, the purpose of the Directive we are discussing today is to reduce the adverse effects of waste incineration on the environment and human health by significantly reduced the emissions of several impurities in the air. This Directive also aims to monitor the release of waste into our waterways. This report is now in the parliament in another treatment. I note that a single recommendation from the European Council states that if the operator of a harmless waste incineration plant intends to start burning hazardous waste, he must have a permit in accordance with the Directive to harmonize the prevention and reduction of the environment.	fi
".Women suffer from increasing inequalities because they are victims of sexist discrimination which can exercise in an open way (violence, rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence ...) but also more insidiously.This oppression is based on a sexual and social division of work which values ​​the work of men compared to that of women.Salaries are uneven, their work is still perceived as ""extra"" work and more generally the employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men.In addition, family responsibilities are mainly based on them.Women must be entitled to a full -time job, in the same way as men.Coercive laws must be passed to promote professional equality.States must develop a public service for the care of early childhood.Finally, to allow everyone to engage in public life, it takes a massive reduction in working time.It takes a real mix of political, economic and social life.We fight the idea that the biological difference between women and men would cause two visions of the world and two different values ​​systems.Women have the right to be present in the decision -making process as ""individuals"" and not as representatives of the female sex.My colleagues from the British conservative delegation and I are fully committed to responding to the need to increase the number of women actively and fully playing a role in public life.We share the regrets expressed as to the subsistence of inequality and discrimination on the basis of sex and in particular with regard to the under-representation of women in politics.However, we are not convinced that discrimination should be countered by another, namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee seats for women.I feel it in a particularly lively way because Thursday evening, my 27-year-old daughter, Caroline was selected conservative candidate for the district of Southampton Itchen in the United Kingdom.She came to this position totally on the basis of her merits and following a competition against all the participants.We should not adopt a position which in any way decreases the position of the growing number of women who show that they can impose themselves in public life without fear or favor.The members of my delegation and I have therefore supported a large part of the resolution but we oppose the call for positive discrimination in favor of women, which, in our opinion, would not be a good way to move forward, but would actually be degrading for women and would distort the democratic process.As a result, we abstained in the final vote.KATIFORIS report (A5-0041/2000) Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Katiforis report on the assessment of the European Union economy in 1999 by group discipline, because it denounces an extremely serious deficiency which it will contribute, I hope, to eliminate in the coming years.We do not explain clearly, we do not even explain at all, in this report that the economy of the States of the Union also depends and especially the way in which the funds allocated to pensions are used, taken from workers."	fr
"I was happy to hear last week that the Commission has been paying great attention to the concept of auxiliary and its reference not only to the relations between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Union, the Member States, the Regions and the cities. I hope that in the continuation of the dialogue on Europe's regions, Commissioner Barnier will refer to this thought in detail and learn from what he will hear. Mr. Commissioner, I am referring to one of your answers to the previous questions, where you mention what I call possible ""lock"" of the treaty against the dangers of derogation, and in particular the differentiation of sanctions that can be affected by a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for violations. Do you think that these proposals, or such proposals, can be included in the IMD command, as set out in Helsinki? Personally I don't think so. Are you not afraid of such sanctions and are used as punishment not for human rights violations but for simple divergences, persecutions due to thought or deviations from the dominant European thought? Indeed, Mr Bonde, we will start this discussion with 700 young people in Brussels, who are going to work on European institutions and the committee, and I believe it is a good starting point for this dialogue with young people who have motivation. Regarding social protection, I confirm that we have made suggestions on the special majority and unanimity free of ideologies. In your country, Mr Bonde, as well as everywhere, I think there is a dedication to the proper functioning of the internal market, as well as the most just competition conditions and releases of goods and individuals. So this is our rule. We are essentially proposing to make decisions under a special majority for certain policies and certain tax, social protection and social security measures, provided they are directly linked to the proper functioning of the internal market. Our proposal is neither universal nor absolute. I know well how sensitive these issues of taxation and social protection are. I believe that we should not put all the national social protection systems in the same mold - no such issue has ever been raised - but simply to secure, in Europe of thirty or twenty -seven states, the best operating conditions of the internal market, where a state will not be able to block the remaining 26 or 27 MacCormicks. States, how they should approach people as much as possible in their place of residence, where their roots are, and if I would tell you something different I would be inconsistent as a commissioner responsible for regional policy, that is, one of the most specific and most visible policies, which aims to promote them. You even often hear me say that this policy is not only designed with the primary goal of cohesion and solidarity between the regions, but also to help people, in their place of residence, to maintain their roots, their traditions, their souls and identity."	el
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of negotiators that is important, it is the quality of what they will say.And I want to recall once again in front of your parliament, given the experience that was mine before Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or the weakness of the status that had been recognized by the two representatives of the European Parliament, before Amsterdam, the quality of what Ms. Guigou and Mr. Brok said in this negotiation.I am sure that it will be the same and as far as I am concerned, in the place which is mine, I will ensure that the ideas carried by your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout this negotiation.I am sure that the European Parliament will not be a spectator of this negotiation, not more elsewhere that the commission will not be a spectator.We are therefore waiting for now, ladies and gentlemen, with great interest, your later opinion in which you will specify the priorities and concrete proposals of the Parliament for this negotiation.It is of great importance that the two European institutions which will be present in these negotiations, the Commission, on the one hand, the European Parliament, on the other, alongside the members of the Council, clearly explain to the citizens of the Union, always explain and every day to the citizens of the Union, what are the challenges of this conference and what answers we recommend, as a European institutions responsible for ensuring the good functioning of this enlargedThe common interest.In the coming months, Ladies and Gentlemen, the Commission will therefore work in close consultation, in good intelligence, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, in order to bring our points of view, if it is needed.Probably our points of view and our positions will not always be the same, there will undoubtedly be differences, as it is normal.What is important is that there is coherence, and it is to work in this coherence that I committed myself from the start of my functions within the college.We therefore have the concern and the ambition, on a very large number of themes, to be on the same length of waves and to carry this negotiation upwards.It will not be a coincidence, since, I repeat, it seems to me that we have the same ambition for this negotiation and we feel together that it constitutes a moment of truth for the European Union.I would finally like to make three additional observations, quickly, the president.First, to congratulate and thank the President Napolitano and the Constitutional Affairs Committee for the extremely strong and original initiative which was taken yesterday by bringing together the qualified representatives of national parliaments, the Constitutional Affairs Committee and the Commission for a first common debate.This dialogue between national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important.I said that I would take my part there by going to each of the national parliaments myself.	fr
If change applications are accepted that soften the directive, this would be extremely negative, not only for the environment, but also for the credibility of the European Parliament in environmental issues.In today's pronunciation it was pointed out that the millions of people who find work in the auto industry are just as little forgotten as the countries with a strongly developed automotive industry, such as:B. my home country of Sweden.I myself was a car worker before my choice and I am certainly one of the few in this parliament who stood on a assembly line and assembled cars.In my opinion, high requirements have to be placed on the motor vehicle industry, because this favors the modern, environmentally conscious and quickly developed automobile manufacturers.And we have to promote this type of auto industry in the European Union.Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for Parliament, as well as for the citizens of Europe.STARE vehicles disguise the environment and represent a serious impairment for them. Our citizens expect us to represent their interests in this regard.Every year, eight to nine million cars are scrapped in the European Union.This alone is a huge amount of waste.Vehicle and parts manufacturers and the suppliers of materials have to strive to limit the use of dangerous substances as far as possible.It is therefore already to be secured in the design phase that recycled fabrics can be used in vehicle production.We know that there are recycling systems approved in the Netherlands for the recording of old vehicles, and I think that we should introduce them throughout the European Union.As for Ireland, I know that the Irish Ministry of the Environment has taken consultations with representatives of the automotive industry, the aim of which is to introduce suitable centers in the near future for the recording of waste vehicles in Ireland.In my opinion, there is no reason that speaks against the Europe -wide conclusion of concession agreements for recycling plants, in which the eight to nine million vehicles, which are retired annually in the European Union, are brought to the scrapping.The automotive manufacturers must provide information on the reused, rewriting and recycling rates for used cars provided for for the next few years.According to the new provisions of the Amsterdam contract, the 370 million consumers in the European Union have the right to consumer -specific information.I am convinced that consumers will support those automotive manufacturers in the EU who will introduce the most environmentally friendly practices in the coming year.In conclusion, I would like to determine that relevant regulations and laws should take into account the special position of the classic car industry in the European community, which plays a special role in terms of social, economic and ecological issues.President, dear colleagues!With the guideline for old vehicles, a milestone is undoubtedly set on the way to improving the environment in our European Union.In my opinion, huge efforts were also made in order to achieve reasonable material recycling and reducing environmental waste and to promote technological innovation.From this point of view, we are certainly on the right track, but as has already been emphasized by some colleagues, the real problem is that the manufacturers may only be responsible.	de
"The word is to Mr. Rübig.Mr. President, fourteen Member States have taken bilateral sanctions against a Member State, because a democratically elected government has been trained.The two parties have already participated in the government.They have not committed any legal offense until today.Are preventive sanctions compatible with the human rights charter?A right of veto of the President of the Council for National Government Training would he be compatible with the Charter of Fundamental Rights?Is the appeal to violent demonstrations compatible with the Charter of fundamental rights?The deputy, as the chairman in office of the Council, I have no answer to give you for the simple reason that the position of the Portuguese Prime Minister, on behalf of the fourteen heads of state and government of the Member States of the European Union, took place on a bilateral level and not on that of the Presidency of the European Union.I would like to say, however, that all the preventive actions that have been adopted on the strictly bilateral level by the Member States of the European Union concerns a set of actions of nature, I would say, from political prophylaxis on the diplomatic level, which seems perfectly justified and which seems to us to go in the sense of what is reasonable in the face of the behavior of a party and personalities of this party which do not seem to give the guarantees to be ableof which he would be part.I would not like to expand on this question in the name of the presidency of the Union because it is an intervention that my government has made at the request and in collaboration with fourteen member states and not as the presidency of the European Union.Mr. President, I have the honor to be part of the convention which writes the Charter, I will therefore not ask the presidency to speculate on its content or if it thinks that the Convention should be declaratory or if it should have legal force.I would like to know what will happen to the Charter project that the Convention is writing.Will the council process it like a document which he must accept as it is, or will the council consider himself free to amend this document?Will the council simply say yes or no to this project or will it be in a position to rework this charter project once again?The answer is neither yes nor no.I do not know, Mr. MP, it will depend on the decision taken at the level of the council.Question nº 8 of (H-0042/00): Purpose: granting of export credits guarantees and consequences for the construction of the Ilisu dam in Turkey the G8 gathered in Cologne invited the OECD to initiate a process of establishing joint standards in the field of the granting of guarantees of export credits.Indeed, these guarantees can be used to distort competition and finance questionable projects.The European Union takes the initiative in the launch of this process?The need has been demonstrated recently when the British government said it was ""willing to grant"" a license in export credits to a company participating in the construction of the Ilisu dam in Türkiye."	fr
It must be evident that the subsidiarity comes into play, i.h.It must be clear that we do not act in areas where it is not necessary.The second problem affects households.In view of a growth rate that is higher than the 2.5 % in the financial foresight, we can take other measures with regard to households than we would otherwise have done.On behalf of my faction, I would like to warn the commission against relocating agricultural editions from Category 1 according to Category 4.Especially in the UK, agriculture is in a desperate location and hopes to be a certain support for certain areas of the sector.A relocation of the funds provided for agriculture from one budget category to another would send the wrong signals at the present time.Finally, a word of caution on the question of information.This problem has burdened the relationships between our parliament and the previous commission, because according to the contracts we basically have access and the right to access to all information.It looks as if our framework agreement could be difficult.I therefore emphasize that we have to clarify this problem as soon as possible and that there are no restrictions on documents that are accessible to the citizen if we want the commission and parliament work together.As Mr. Bonde realized correctly, it is about creating a European Union in which there is a unhindered flow of information between the administrative structures and all of our citizens.Dear Mr Commission President!When they took office, they said that the commission should be characterized by transparency.That has already been addressed several times today.But what is the situation now?Why are the commission's press conferences no longer broadcast directly via satellite so that everyone can follow throughout Europe?I hope that Mr. Prodi listens.Mr President Prodi!As for Ms. Fontaine on the question of the civil officer: Do you assume that the civic representative is bound by a principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions?Where do you find a legal basis in this case, and do you think that such a principle could suppress the right of the civic officer to freely comment on the press?In addition, I would like to inform about the following facts with a view to your letter to the editor in Wall Street Journal.There they refer to a seminar for transparency as proof that the regulation has been drawn up under transparent conditions.This seminar has been organized by the European Federation of Journalists, the MP Lööw, Thors and Haitala and others, but the proposal discussed there has nothing to do with the current one.The latter has been created in secret.Above all, however, the commission president, the question arises as to whether the principle of loyal cooperation should have priority over the principle of freedom of expression.Where is such a principle underpinning with which you could suppress this right and confront the civic representative with such claims?Mr President, I will only deal with some aspects of their very demanding and comprehensive report.	de
"Why would I not say that we have noticed, on the part of the Greek government, in the past years, a certain deficiency with regard to the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation for the association of representatives of civil society.I say it objectively and when we see a problem or a deficiency, it is necessary to delete this problem or this deficiency.So, I will watch out for the implementation of the new community support framework.I call question No. 45 of (H-0041/00): Subject: Financing by structural research funds in the Civil Nuclear field The unwanted commission confirm that in the last programming period of structural funds 19941999, no support was allocated to research in the field of nuclear fission and fission?Little also undertake to exclude any measure of financing this type of research during the ongoing negotiations with the Member States in terms and programs of the new period 20002006?What role, on the other hand, will play the contribution of structural funds to the promotion of renewable energies?Can we expect the financing of structural funds in terms of energy policy to promote regional and renewable energy resources?Will structural funds also finance large energy transport networks?I would like to answer Ms. Isler Béguin on the first point and remind her that improving the scientific base and the technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the community priorities during the previous programming period.The support allocated by the structural funds in favor of technological cohesion, that is to say research and technological development in the context of community support managers during this period, is estimated at around 7.5 billion euros.It is roughly, Madam MP, 6 % of the total community contribution.Regarding precisely your concern, I want to tell you that without the previous period, the Commission does not have the intention to directly finance research and technological development in the field of nuclear merger or fission through structural funds.It remains in the responsibility of the authorities for the management of the member states to select the projects which are implemented within the framework of these CCAs.Consequently, the deputy, even if this does not constitute a priority of the community, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the field of civil nuclear, provided that these projects contribute to regional development and without systematically informing the Commission.Regarding your second point which, you know, interests me and continues to interest me a lot, renewable energies, the commission approach is presented in the document on structural funds and their coordination with the cohesion fund.These provide that investments in the renewable energies sector must be encouraged insofar as they promote the development of local resources, where they contribute to the reduction of dependence on energy imports and are also creative of jobs at the local level.I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit that I made in Portugal, a few days ago in the Azores, being a natural source of renewable energy.The contribution of structural funds, in favor of greater penetration of the renewable energies market, was also highlighted in the campaign for the takeoff of renewable energy sources, launched by the general management ""Transport and Energy""."	fr
Three problems still need clarification.The first is about the transfer of water between catchment areas.My colleagues in Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom are affected.The amendments 4, 49 and 87 would be unacceptable because they would limit the possibilities of a country to redistribute water in which it would be plentiful to needy areas, such as low -precipitation or cities.Second, we have to face goals, but they have to be realistic.A look at the change of change No. 7, which demands the complete switching off of naturally incurred substances, shows that some of the goals set are unrealistic.In addition, some of the goals provide values ​​close to zero;A wording that makes little sense in English.We have to deal with it again.The concept of continuous reduction used in amendment no. 58 is much better.Third, I would like to address the problem of Scottish whiskey.The production of Scottish whiskey and above all Malt whiskey, the best whiskey, requires the removal of considerable amounts of water, which are then returned to the river.However, part of the water gets into the bottle and is drunk.We have to ensure that the change applications No. 49 and 87 do not cancel the exemption, so that it is still possible to enjoy high -quality whiskey.In this context, this means that good Scottish peat water must be used.My third concern is that we check these measures in detail before we pass the measure as a whole.Mr President, First of all, we want to denounce the bottomless hypocrisy of those who pretend to sacrifice themselves for the environment and water, and at the same time through criminal actions such as the attack on Yugoslavia not only thousands of dead and wounded on the conscience, but also huge ecological devastation, also caused by water resources, not only unusable, but even extremely harmful to health.As for the report itself, we think that the application of the principle of cost recovery in water services is by no means to be used to add additional taxation economically weaker or even to exterminate small and medium -sized farmers, who may then no longer be able to afford to irrigate their cultures.We also point out that infrastructure projects for water savings have to be financed in regions with acute lack of water such as in my country, especially on the islands.This saving is not to be achieved by increasing the amount, but by increasing the crowd, especially by catching rainwater, which is currently unused, flows into the sea and causes the erosion of the soil with all the resulting problems.In this respect, we support the amendment 107 of colleague Marset Campos.It is also necessary that the optimal use of river water ensures life in regions with chronic lack of water.The claim of the Council, which the Commission has also joined, does not require many concrete information and explanations, because these points are covered by the examples of the directive or are contained there in other places can only be understood as a point.In this way, one wants to continue to act in a very opaque field because it is possible in the first implementation phase of the directive to fix critical decisions in favor of major capital.	de
President, dear colleagues!I do not need to repeat what the woman said, nor what the colleague Coelho has already carried out.This is all right and correct.The euro can be easily fake.We are in a dangerous transition phase in which - I believe in the history of money - probably unique phenomenon occurs, namely that a money that has not yet existed, which is not yet in circulation, but is only available as a book money, can still be fake, but due to the fact that it is not yet in circulation as a currency, the criminal offense at this point in time cannot be effective.A very complicated problem.This means that if we don't act quickly - the colleague Cederschiöld is right - you can already do a few wrong euros and may not be held accountable for their inum order.For some, I allow myself to say in passing, that may be an attractive view.What is the European Union about?A lot of real things that the colleague Cederschiöld described, but the parliament in connection with what she has described must say something less about the content of the framework decision, also less about the report that the colleague Cederschiöld wrote about it, but say something, but about the procedures that are applied.The European Parliament has been consulted by the Council, which has been consulted with a wide distance in Europe, in a way that speaks mockery to the concept of democracy.We have been sent a text for the consultation, where the Council itself made a very long period of time, by the way, only to share with success - I can talk about it right away.The European Parliament should now comment on this complex, difficult, partly contradictory paper of the Council within three months.It is only thanks to the enormous use of the colleague Cederschiöld and the waiver of the European Parliament to make use of its democratic law in sufficient time and with the availability of all texts in all languages ​​to carry out his consultation procedure that we can now come to a statement and thus to the upcoming decision in March.With such an important issue as that of falsification of money or protection against falsification of money and criminal harmonization, which is necessary for this, you cannot actually work in this pork gallop that the Council demands.That is why I want to say in all clarity for my faction: We have long discussed with the colleague Cederschiöld about whether it makes sense to work like this.We came to the conclusion that it is not the case, but in view of the importance of the object, we agreed to accept the procedure in this way.This framework decision is without a doubt.Only, the legal certainty that was actually desired by the Council - the colleague Cederschiöld has already carried out - is not fully achieved in the end, because with the intended minimum standards, the minimum standard of criminal liability and, above all, the use of the same criminal law standards in all member countries - even in those who have not yet been introduced in which the euro could not be fake - these deficits have not been remedied.	de
We have seen that war is affecting the environment in the long run and is dangerous to it. For the environment, we have just given the Directive on the pollution of the sea. It also includes ammunition and weapons, and so on, and has an early warning system. Unfortunately, we are not able to give guarantees, but we can only continue to control and try to clean the traces. I wanted to ask a member of the Commission whether the NATO troops now placed in the area are subjected to special inspections for radioactive radiation and that similar actions do not apply to civilians living in the area?.(EN) I can't answer your question. I do not have all the necessary information about medical examinations in order to give you an appropriate answer. With regard to the environment, we know what I have already mentioned that there is now an environmental reconstruction plan, but I have no information on medical examinations. Of course, I can go back to it and find out if we can get the necessary information. Question 30 (H-0793/99): Subject: Appointment of EU Tibet Special Representative, according to the Tibetan Refugee Administration, over 4,000 Tibetians endangered their lives and fled through the Himalayan Mountains in 1998. The Tibetan Working Party is very concerned about the deteriorating situation of Tibet. The European Union's current policy has clearly not been sufficient to combat serious human rights abuses, to which the Tibetans are exposed to Tibet every day. For this reason, the Tibetan Working Party is extremely concerned about the continuation of human rights violations in Tibet. In this context, the Working Party takes into account the proposal of the Dalai Lama's proposal through a dialogue with China. The Working Party is asking the Commission against this background to appoint a special representative of the EU Tibetan, who highlights the European Union's issues and strives to launch a dialogue between Tibet and Chinese authorities. When does the Commission appoint a special representative for the Tibetans? Commission member Patten has a speech..(EN) Many unite the concern of the European Parliament about Tibet. I have long been of the opinion that we have to express our views to the Chinese authorities on human rights issues, including Tibet, firmly and openly. The European Union made both the European Union and China Summit in Beijing last month, where we pressured China for several human rights issues, including Tibet. We encouraged China to start a dialogue with Dalai Lama again. Again, we urge China to do so. We are still going to talk to Tibet with the Chinese authorities. In addition, we do many other things: in the human rights call between the European Union and China, we are focused on several practical steps. For example, we have sent experts for a work assignment and planned development assistance programs and measures that focus on the health, education and vocational training of Tibetans. Appointing the EU Tibetan Special Representative would be primarily a matter of the Council, and Parliament might want to talk directly with the Council. For my part, however, I am not sure that it would have a great deal of practical impact. It is unlikely to affect the Chinese authorities much, and we already have effective communication channels with a Tibetan community living in exile. I would also like to avoid the explosive increase in the number of special representatives, no matter how valuable it is. Mr President, Mr Patte, a commission member, of course, have a great experience for the time you spend in China, and you know very well how strongly the Tibetans are trying to create dialogues, all of which have been blocked so far. However, if your answer is that we should turn to the high representative of a common foreign and security policy, Javier Solana, I am afraid it is a one-sided trend in foreign policy. Your starting point, which I warmly supported as a consistent starting point, has been inspired by human rights. I fully support that we have to take care of human rights. Retaining, torture, mutilation and other similar activities, they are definitely the topics of discussion throughout the evening.	fi
To achieve the goals mentioned, also with the support of the Commission, both the funds and the policies of the new program financed by the social fund for the period 2002-2006 are to be used.The Commission will observe carefully to what extent the Greek government fulfills the obligations taken over by it.I thank the commissioner for her answer.But, Ms. Commissioner, the situation is as follows: In terms of the unemployment rate, we are in second place in Europe with 11.3 % -it was not that bad in the past -we have the highest increase in unemployment and the lowest expenses for unemployed, namely less than 1 % of GDP, while other countries (e.g. France, Belgium and Germany) spend 3-4 %.In addition, it is not clear how the funds provided from the social fund were used to combat unemployment.They spoke of the fact that some recommendations have been made by the Commission.It's pretty good and beautiful, but now it is really to be hoped that these recommendations will also follow acts.However, the following question has been concerned for a long time: What about the previous policies?Has anyone found work?How many have received a job?If you cannot provide us with any information for the current year, then for the last or the penultimate.What about training and further education?Should the infamous training centers give the work that train there or those who are trained there?Are there any concrete figures?So do we have the opportunity to control what comes out of the Greek government's policy?Mr. Papayannakis, I can only explain to you on your question that the Greek government must indeed be more intensive to capture the statistical data electronically in relation to the existing structures, so that the implemented programs also provide the quantitative results you mentioned and is possible to control the situation on the basis of which corresponding policies can be designed.In Greece there was an increase in the employment rate and - as far as I can see here - a productivity growth.The Commission can work where it is about the specific guidelines.As is well known, each country is assessed using 22 guidelines.They refer to access to training opportunities, each as a percentage broken down for men and women, and the special measures for long -term unemployed.The Commission will try to quantify the data for all concrete objectives and, on the basis of the implementation of the new community campaign framework, to get specific information for the period 2000-2006.Inquiry No. 36 of (H-0782/99): Applies: Danish early retirement regulation can the Commission inform whether the Danish early retirement regulation has been approved as a whole and whether there are differences between Denmark and the Commission in other social policy areas?According to the Danish pension system Efterløn, only people with residence in Denmark who have provided the necessary number of years of working in this country can receive pension.Some employees complained to the European Commission that they have no pension entitlement.However, the Danish authorities are not obliged to pay this compensation to the employees in early retirement if they do not meet the conditions defined in Danish law.	de
The stumbling block in negotiations with the Council lies, of course, on the amount of the financial envelope provided for the third stage of the LIFE program (2000-2004).The committee's proposal ratified by the Council is 613 million euros while the Environment Commission estimates that the budget should be 850 million euros.I support the firmness of the rapporteur.Indeed, the financial endowment has not been adapted since the creation of this program, or even during the transition to fifteen Member States following the expansion of the EC.If the report is adopted in plenary, a conciliation must be opened, as provided for in the codecision procedure, to resolve the question of the amount of credits provided for the program.This kind of procedure is common practical since programs or legislative measures are too often equipped with budgets unsuitable for ambitions!Böge report (A5-0023/2000) as a European deputy, and especially as a citizen-consumer, I welcome the European Commission's proposal which marks one more step in the direction of better food security within the European Union.This proposal is twofold: it is a question, on the one hand, of modifying the 1991 council directive relating to the conditions of health police by removing the provisions which concern the trembling of sheep, and, on the other hand, to set up a new regulation establishing the rules of prevention and fight against certain transmissible spongiforms (east) or ESB -type diseases, affecting the Mouton andAnimal.The interest of this new legislation lies in the fact that a specific legal basis is created for the fight against the trembling of the sheep.I am all the more satisfied as it was one of our main requests in our follow -up report on the crazy cow crisis.It also seems essential to me, for the sake of consistency, to melt the existing legislation relating to the trembling, limited to trade in sheep and goats, in a single complete device of new rules governing them affecting all animals in the whole of the European Union, rules intended to prevent the consumption of food or food for animals.This regulation is as welcome as doubts always exist on the trembling of the sheep.Certain scientific hypotheses argue that the trembling of the sheep could have evolved to become the ESB among cattle and thus be at the origin of the ESB epizootic.Even if the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council relating to the prevention and the fight against certain is requested to be specified and strengthened, in particular with regard to the detection and the fight against the trembling, it represents a significant improvement.It is a guarantee given to European citizens who have testified, on many occasions, of their concerns about European food policy.Their concerns, relayed by our European Parliament, were heard.The debates relating to the precautionary principle, traceability, responsibility, transparency, led the European Commission to present a white paper relating to food security.This white paper launches several avenues for reflection and has notably proposed the creation of an independent European food authority.All of this is a European strategy to regain consumer confidence.	fr
Mr. President, I would like to thank the Commissioner Patten for having shown himself as aware of the difficulties that the peace process and the challenge that the European Union must be present for this process.In the Middle East, it is really time for peace to settle;It is time to complete the historic phase which started with the declaration of Balford in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948;It is time for each country in the region to have safe borders, that political, social and economic rights exist, human rights recognized and practiced in Syria, Palestine and Israel, everywhere.For each people and each person, it is also a question of sovereignty and democracy but to do this, it is essential that each party in conflict has the courage to promote peace and respect for rights, that it recognizes the other as a partner and not as a subject to whom concessions should be made.I mainly refer to Nud Palestine-Israel, but this also applies to the Golan's territories, occupied since 1967, and South Lebanon since 1982. Israel must assume its responsibilities, withdraw from occupied territories and share water resources, but at the same time, it must be certain of its own security and be able to live in peace by practicing economic and political exchange with all the countries of the region.Security, however, does not only concern Israel.This applies to the other countries, first for the Palestinians who still live under military occupation and who, even today, despite the agreements signed from Oslo, see their land confiscated in areas B and C. After Oslo and until October 17, 1999, 174 thousand dunans of land were confiscated, of which 8462 under the new Barak government: the trees were uprooted, the housesEast Jerusalem, the use of water has been reduced or even prohibited, while the locations continue and are constantly increasing.However, there is no doubt that the elections of the new government have made progress;At least, negotiations resumes.However, in the Middle East, there can only be stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians have a clean state, that if they can move freely inside their territory.The international community must simply implement resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194. We are worried about the referral to relations with Syria, as well as by the decision of Prime Minister Barak to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and by the charm-el cheikh agreements.We believe that it is vital that the European Union plays a political role in the negotiations equivalent to the role it plays in terms of economic aid.We cannot just stay behind the scenes, on the contrary, we must be leading actors, without risking colliding with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	fr
It is in fact the impression that they both think that Petersberg's missions will eventually be taken up by the Union's defense policy.The treaties also go in this direction, but they leave even greater openness to a more general defense policy which is closer to the old discourse relating to the integration of our policy in a European block.We would therefore express ourselves via this European block within NATO.To tell the truth, I hear less and less often speak.I have the impression that the European Union has reduced its ambitions to the missions of Petersberg and that Mr. Patten takes care of civil affairs, including the police and civil servants quickly mobilized, which he just talked about with enthusiasm, while Mr. Solana takes care of military means and military engagement, all in a perfect spirit of cooperation.It seems to me to go without saying.But is there really nothing else?In terms of defense policy, isn't the emphasis on the role of NATO in collective defense?The European block, which no longer works as such, is limited to the missions of Petersberg.Is this really what we want?We are also talking about the integration of the Union of Western Europe into the European Union, but it is no longer a question of article V that we follow of course very closely since it does not only deal with Petersberg, but also larger defense missions.Is this article removed?In general, we also speak of an increase in budgets allocated to La Défense.I think it is a good thing, but no clear distinction is made in this plea between the missions of Petersberg and the biggest collective defense missions.I wonder how the situation is evolving.I would in fact like to ask Mr. Patten and Mr. Solana how they consider things in the end.Is it necessary to pay more attention to it during the CIG or can it naturally flow from treaties?I am satisfied that an opening was created in defense policy.But I ask myself questions: what will happen if Turkey offers a brigade?Should we authorize this country to take part in decisions concerning this policy?On the structural level, there are haider in the Turkish government.It seems strange to me.Baltic states are also arising.Will they also participate in our defense policy?This is at least a very interesting situation.High representative, you have effectively recalled the progress made in this area between Amsterdam and Helsinki, as well as some of the decisions made after Helsinki, such as the constitution of the three committees and the decision to create the contingent of 50 to 60,000 men, decisions also recently arrested, during the informal meeting of Sintra.However, this acceleration makes the gap between these decisions and the intergovernmental conference in progress even more obvious.	fr
"Of course, we must not lose sight of competitiveness, but social protection must be designed in such a way that it contributes to economic growth and employment.In my opinion, this also becomes clear in the report.After a unanimous decision of the Council, our goal is to start coordinating, exchanging views, the recording of social problems and the establishment of a database for better coordination of the policies next year.I agree with the opinion of many MPs that a first important step is taken.At the Government Conference, a broader approach will already be recognizable for questions of social policy.Now we are likely to have reached a new phase in which social policy is significantly a European policy.Thank you very much, Ms. Diamantopoulou.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m.WIPO contract according to the agenda follows the pronunciation of the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Ms. Cederschiöld on behalf of the Committee on Law and Inner Market for the proposal for a decision for a decision on the approval-in the name of the European Community-to the Wipo consulting law contract and the wipo contract for performances and recordings (COM (1998) 24-C5-022/1999-1998/0141 (AVC)).President!Here we comment on an important question, an international contract in an area that can influence the development of prosperity in many Member States.In my home country of Sweden, for example, one of the largest export industries is affected.It is about music and sound recordings, about the rights of the artists on the copyright protection of their artistic products.The WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the Wppt (World Perfoma and Phonograms Treaty) are up for debate.Without the protection of intellectual property, the financial incentives and creativity are inhibited.Force has become a big business.In Europe alone, it is expected by pirated copies with loss of income of 4.5 billion euros, a problem that also affects many jobs in the entertainment industry.This is a historical contract because the European Union is one of the contracting pages, even though the EU does not include the EU, but only the Member States of the organization.There is a special clause according to which the consent of the parliament is required in two cases.As far as this contract is concerned, both conditions are fulfilled here: a new institution, a ""assembly"" is created, which will continue to deal with the contract and its effects in the future.In addition, the contract affects questions that must be treated according to the co -decision.So the parliament must give its consent because its responsibility is touched.The future will show whether it is right to restrict the responsibility of the Commission in these questions through this new parliamentary assembly.In any case, the parliament cannot do anything at the moment.The contract completes the Bern agreement on the protection of literary works.International legal protection for distribution, sales, rental, public reproduction and provision is created, as well as protection for computer programs and databases.However, there are problems in the case of the ""author"", since this term is not defined, for example.Another question that can lead to complications is the intermediate storage.A general clause is provided for this in the contract, which, however, does not contain a definition."	de
When the United States and NATO, and finally also the EU reacted, it was already late, very late.Many suffering could have been avoided, if in particular the EU had acted earlier and more clearly.The EU therefore has a particular responsibility to assume, when helping and assisting the Balkans in their reconstruction.Our priority objective must be to create the necessary conditions so that all countries in southeast Europe can be integrated, with others, in the EU - on the economic, commercial and political level.The best method to create, in this part of Europe ravaged by war, the breeding ground for democracy, goes through trade and economic integration.The members of the Liberal group are ready to act quickly and in depth, as Mr. Paolo Costa said.This is why we welcome the proposal for stabilization and association with the most satisfaction with the Macedonia that was presented to us, and we thank Mr. Swoboda for the high quality of its report.Macedonia deserves our support, especially if we think of the sacrifices and altruistic work that were made by the population and the leaders of this country during the Kosovo War.As Macedonia is very difficult to extract from the destructive rets of communism and nationalism, it is up to us to act without any ambiguity, and to support them.And we have to do as much for the other Balkan countries.It is for the EU an imperative duty.Mr. President, allow me here to remind the members of this assembly - by making the link with a subject which we discussed earlier, during this evening - that the man who carries the main responsibility of this war, violations of human dignity, assassinations and the expulsion of innocent people outside their home, continues to direct what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia.This man who is accused of genocide and who should appear before the International Criminal Tribunal of The Hague is still in freedom.I'm talking about Mr. Milosevic.As long as it will remain in power and Serbia will not be committed to the path of democracy, this country will represent a threat to peace in the Balkans - including for Macedonia.Mr. President, the proposed agreement will constitute the first application of the stability agreement in Southeast Europe.It is obvious that the terms of this agreement, which the Swoboda report adopts, do not have peace for objective but rather a political and economic mastery of the country more important, the exploitation of its natural wealth, the hyperexploitation of the workers' potential and the use, to a greater extent, of the country as a bridgehead against the other countries and the peoples of the region which resist the new order.And all this in exchange for the promise of future membership in the European Union.The report accepts these guidelines, as well as the more general policy of the European Union in favor of Southeast Europe.It is typical to note that the report sends its congratulations to ARYM for its constructive attitude adopted during the attack by NATO, that it praises its peaceful role, for having accepted the parking of the NATO forces on its territory.Naturally, the exasperation of the people, manifested through mass movements during NATO bombings, has passed over in silence.	fr
Much.Mr President of the Commission!If you read your white book about the reform of the Commission, you cannot avoid finding that the guideline, the idea on which this reform is based, is something very tasted that we cannot accept in this parliament.This guideline essentially exists in the protection of the community's financial interests.Of course, this is our concern, but it is only the starting point.Based on this, the Commission must start working, it must fulfill its obligations that it has according to the contract.Let me give you an example, because in the speaking time I don't have many ways to explain this idea.Let us take the reform mentioned in connection with the violation procedures.What is intended?It is simply that it is about managing the resources available at the respective level instead of complying with the demands of this parliament, for reasons of legal certainty to create a real administrative procedure right, which is necessary from the perspective of the European citizen, that is, from the perspective of those who can initiate this violation.It is simply said that this administrative procedure is not created, but that the lawsuits are selected.How?Just as these things are selected, purely arbitrary.From the point of view of this parliament, such derivations cannot be approved.We understand that the commission must be reformed, we share the goals of this reform, but of course not in such a way that for an important interest that is of all interest - namely the protection of the financial interests of the community - the great impulse of the European structure is overwhelmed, an impulse that is primarily responsible for the commission based on the commission based on the contract.Thank you very much, Mr. Prodi, for your presentation and your documentation.Congratulations on the use of the Internet for the general public - a very good idea.I want to start trading.We agree with you that we need a trading system that is subject to certain rules.It really depends on that.Seattle failed because, in particular, the United States, in particular, were unable to understand that measures such as environmental protection, the preservation of rural communities are legitimate by shared agricultural policy, animal welfare, health protection and social rights.With regard to the legitimate fears of the developing countries, they proved an astonishing level of instinctuallessness, and there is little, there is little that the developing countries of the WTO could have been grateful for so far.We expect the European Union to continue the negotiations and to adhere to our immovable point of view in all of these questions.At the same time, with the help of our contacts with the developing countries, it must be ensured that the next round will be a fair round.If we could have detailed suggestions in the next three months, how to do this.Innovation and knowledge - a topic that is appropriate to the new century.How much innovation did the commission take place and, if I can say, in parliament?A few years ago we had a white book for innovation - what has happened since then?I would like to find one thing here with great emphasis, namely that we are concerned with follow -up measures, not just about an excellent message that we welcome, but about follow -up measures, follow -up measures and follow -up measures !!!	de
We hope in the financial support of the Independent Press by the European Union, but also in a series of financial aid to Serbia, which helps the entire affected population and ensuring that the Serbian population will eventually be able to live and choose a democratic government. Mr President, I believe that today we all agree with the examination of the issue and the treatment of the media in Serbia. The situation in Yugoslavia is getting worse day by day. It seems that Milosevic and his people play a triple game by trying to deregulate anything they can. Tension in Montenegro is constantly increasing. At the border with Kosovo there is a special turmoil and the Belgrade regime is trying to create a climate in which major catastrophes could occur. Characteristic of the last few weeks has been the introduction of a series of oppressive measures against independent media. The measures were eating from high fines to immediate intimidation. At the same time, there is a kind of internal isolation. Access to the country is getting more and more difficult. I also faced this situation myself when I tried a few weeks ago to visit opposition party conferences in Serbia. That weekend the authorities refused to give me a visa, and two weeks earlier allowed many international guests to attend the Milosevic fantastic conference. This shows that authorities do what they can to avoid influence from abroad. There is also a limitation of telephone conversations, e -mail and the simple mail is monitored. It seems that the government is seeking to expel the opposition from the local power centers after the last municipal elections. The new regime can beat the elections - which are expected in May - only if it essentially neutralizes the opposition. In my opinion, this game is dangerous. That is why we believe that we must strongly protest against media oppression, but also that the European Union must seek ways to directly support independent media in Serbia. This is a very important opposition support, which will undertake new actions in the spring that I believe we must support, of course, with regard to the media. Mr President, it is clear that Milosevic's many new new war against free media has begun. All of this resembles a very strange election recoil. The campaign has begun and all those who disagree with it must keep their mouths closed. It is truly unacceptable to hold formally democratic elections in a country where the opposition has no opportunity to express its opinion. This characterizes a totalitarian regime that is well aware of that free media can create problems and even seriously threaten a regime like Milosevic. The help of the European Union - a matter on which we probably agree - can generally hire two forms. It would be a good idea to give the media aid to the surrounding countries - Croatia was also named - as well as in some other countries.	el
It is not only an economic challenge, but perhaps, even more so, a process of deep cultural change that should reach every family, every school, every business, every public administration. In order to achieve this important goal, not only the dissemination of new technologies must be encouraged, but it is also fundamental to implement the necessary measures to enhance consumer confidence in the great opportunities offered by e -commerce. This is a real need, given the great cautiousness with which our fellow citizens approach these new media. Only with a high degree of protection will it be possible to actually disseminate the use of new technologies in the daily lives of millions of people, and only by defining clear rules will European citizens can make the most of the benefits they offer. By this logic, I had submitted to the Industry Committee a series of amendments that were designed to emphasize the importance of consumer protection in the plan to disseminate the new technologies presented by the Prodi Commission. I regret that only part of these amendments was approved at the Read colleague's report, which I agree with in general, and I hope that this is only the result of the unfortunate circumstances that did not allow my committee, which deals with the protection of consumers, to approve a formal opinion. I am sure that in the future, at the stage of negotiating the action plan that will follow the Lisbon Summit, there will be more effective cooperation between the two committees..(NL) Mr President, gentlemen, ladies, and gentlemen, when we are very much more attention to the effort to develop the opportunities to create a society of information that will be open to all, we must also make every effort to avoid a binary society. In addition, I find it particularly important to secure the interests of small and medium -sized enterprises - especially the small ones. In this respect, there must be a care to establish guarantees for advertising. Because there is no harmonized policy in the field of commercial communications, there is a chance of obstacles that will be insurmountable, especially for small businesses. Consequently, the harmonization of commercial communications should be promoted. Finally, I would like to emphasize that the sides concerned, that is, consumers and entrepreneurs, must be able to conclude in advance agreements on the establishment of the appropriate jurisdiction. Indeed, if the rule is still valid under which the consumer can always appeal to his country of his country, a small business there is no chance of being able to defend its interests because it should seek legal assistance to the other 14 Member States, which is certainly impossible for it.(Gue/ngl).(FR) Mr President, dear colleagues, with the EEUROPE initiative, our Commission reminds us that Europe is delaying the development of information society.	el
As far as social protection is concerned, I can confirm that we have made suggestions on the area of ​​the qualified majority and the area of ​​unanimity without ideological ulterior motives.In your country, Mr. Bonde, as well as anywhere else, you attach great importance to the smooth functioning of the internal market, on the best possible conditions for competition as well as free goods and passenger transport.And we let ourselves be guided by it.In fact, we indicate that certain policies or measures in the area of ​​tax policy, social protection or social security are decided with a qualified majority if they are directly related to the smooth functioning of the internal market.Our proposal is not a general or continuous nature.I know very well how delicate these questions of tax policy or social protection are.In my opinion, it is not necessary to standardize all national social protection systems, but it has never been mentioned, but it is simply a matter of ensuring the best conditions for functioning the internal market in a Europe with 30 or 27 countries without a state being able to block the other 26 or 27.Mr MP Maccormick, yes, I confirm that this dialogue will go far beyond the national capitals that he should reach the people where they live where they are rooted.And if I said something else, I would object to myself as a responsible commissioner for regional policy, i.h.One of the most concrete and visible policies that serve to support the employment situation and the quality of life of the people in their region.I often care to say that this policy is not only operated in the sense of the primary goal of cohesion and solidarity among the regions, but also for the fact that people can preserve their roots, soul and their identity where they live.We will therefore conduct this dialogue in the cities and the regions.Mr. Berthu, Helsinki's mandate is clear, and we move in this context.It states that we first and primarily deal with the three basic topics that have remained unsolved in Amsterdam.In addition, there are the related institutional questions and finally the questions that are considered necessary by the Portuguese and French chair in the course of the negotiations.The Commission acts according to its mandate if it believes that it has to complement your statement on a variety of institutional questions in this or that point.I am not yet sure whether this will be the case with Article 7, but if we do it, then not only in response to a special situation, which is so serious that the fourteen governments of the Union were determined together, but we will also consider the future in general.Everything that can be done to the final securing of the community of values ​​that we have together since the founding fathers built the Union in 1957 and formed earlier since the end of the Second World War has been useful.I am sure, Mr. Berthu, that we - you and I - can at least find a match on this basis.	de
"If the European Union wishes to become a community of values, if we wish to play an essential role in the new global governance, then we must transcend the values ​​of the Geneva Convention not only to our soldiers and security forces, but also to ordinary citizens. We must put pressure on the creation of a constant international criminal court and push the Member States to sign and ratify the contract. We have to work hard to combat racism and xenophobia. The Liberal Democrats in this parliament are proud that three of the authors of today's exhibitions, Mrs Malmstrfm, the lady. Haarder and Baroness Ludford dealt with these issues and submitted their reports to Parliament today. We live in the hope that the twentieth century, which Europe has rolled into blood, will give way to a twenty -first century in which the power, intelligence and excitement of mankind will be channeled to build a fairer, more peaceful, more stable world. Dear Mr President, I agree fully with what is said by previous speakers. Yesterday we talked about the map of fundamental rights and today we are discussing human rights. Yesterday, during an excellent intervention it was recognized that we have the moral obligation to defend and promote democracy and human rights. However, the essential content of this moral check and the true measure of our effort and commitment lies in what is happening in this landmark reality characterized by wars and armed conflicts. The character of wars and armed conflict has changed dramatically in the last century. Humanitarian law is the indicator with which we can demonstrate if this moral imperative motivates us only to words or, if it actually leads to action and in practice. Today we learned about the case of Kosovar Albin Kurt. Geneva conventions constitute an integral and significant part of this minimum level. We should also ensure that the Charter of the International Criminal Court, as well as the Ottawa Protocol on the ban on the land of land, be ensured. Mr President, the Russian ambassador to Paris, answering a question during a radio interview on January 20th, said: ""What we do in Chechnya is an anti -terrorist struggle and both Europe and the whole world will.""Personally, I do not believe that the European Parliament must thank Russia. I believe, on the contrary, that a strong conviction needs to come from this parliament, stronger and clearer than those to date and which involves not only the Community bodies but also the individual governments. A few days ago, I regretted a person that public opinion is particularly appreciated by Tony Blair, to pay an official visit to Moscow and, after a timid and not a convincing protest of the events in Chechnya, to embrace and encourage Putin. At the time we celebrate Pentecost Anniversary by a great event marking international humanitarian law, such as the Geneva Convention, we cannot close our eyes to the fact that, within walking distance of Europe, all points of the Geneva Convention is not infringed,Need of internal nature."	el
As for the internal reform, you know the commitment made by my committee on this point from the first day.I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if this deep and total internal reform is not carried out, if the Commission is not more effective in all sectors, starting with that where we have accumulated the most delay, that of external aid.Providing quick help where it is necessary makes it possible to save human lives;Providing late help can sometimes be worse than not to provide at all.When I speak of external aid, I think first of the Balkans, where we record some encouraging signs due to the commitment of our officials in the field, an extraordinary commitment in view of the organizational problems encountered.I also think of the efforts made by Mr. Kouchner, the stability pact that we energetically support, with absolute dedication, but also of new elements, for example in Croatia, where the situation changed in a few weeks.The European institutions immediately opened the door to a dialogue with this country, they welcomed these changes knowing perfectly well that the problems of Bosnia and especially of Serbia can only be resolved if democracy settles in Serbia.This is the new element that we must help to spread in the Balkans.We must be more effective in this region, we must restore traffic on the Danube.There is no need to provide help to Romania and Bulgaria and prevent these two countries from using their main resource.We have to decontaminate the river.To do this, the environmental commissioner will present specific projects in the coming days to control this serious problem.We have done a lot in the Balkans: our new European reconstruction agency for Kosovo, the Task Force for the Balkans, a new regulation aimed at accelerating procedures.However, we absolutely have to do more.We must liberalize exchanges in the region, as well as exchanges between this region and the European Union.We must contribute to the establishment of infrastructure links that break up secular isolation.We must intensify efforts with a view to construction in these countries of a democratic and pluralist society with institutions, public structures, police forces and the organization of civil society, but above all we must encourage these countries to collaborate in a unitary regional perspective, both political and economic.If we do not do it, we will fail to our duty.Remember the Marshall Plan, its effectiveness has not resulted from the only importance of its resources, it turned out to be even more effective because it forced us, Europeans, to collaborate in a new perspective, to give a new horizon to our policy and our economy.This is what we have to do for the Balkans.Europe must prove - from Balkans to all the rest of the world - its ability to expand the space of security, peace and freedom, its ability to act on the international scene.	fr
And I will point out, before moving on to my question, that what is happening within the framework of the status of civil servants within the Commission, plays a fundamental role in terms of our responsibilities also as employers, because, of course, the staff of the European Parliament work under the same conditions.This will constitute part of the work that we will have to do and I am convinced that you will all want to engage in this process today.Well, I would like to resume two points with Mr. Kinnock, if you allow me.The first concerns the calendar of these important reforms.Mr. Prodi said in his very important opening discourse that he had identified serious problems within the Commission which relates to a level of low morality and to a low motivation, which clearly constitutes a major concern.We expect a lot from these reforms, both within the Commission and outside.And if we want to move forward, I would say that the reforms concerning the staff, early proofs of a change of culture, that a strengthening of powers and that a motivation of the staff must be done as soon as possible.And according to the original proposals - and I have the impression that the news will not differ in the matter - the general reform of the status of civil servants would not have been accomplished in 2002. Besides, some of the fundamental elements would not have been introduced in 2001. I think that the delay is too long, and we must really advance much faster than that.The second point I want to raise concerns information technology.Have you really taken into account the changes that the new information technology will bring to the level of staff structure, as they will be fundamental for the new management of these reforms.In terms of the second part of Mr. Harbor's question, he will see, during this year, that we will show, with greater precision, in what way the broader application of information technologies will facilitate change, not only in terms of personnel practices and conditions of staff but also in terms of the operation of the Commission, as the President has briefly underlined.Let me thank Mr. Harbor for his energetic commitment in favor of the subject for which he is rapporteur and to answer him by saying that we firmly believe that the moral, motivation and professional commitment of commission officials, already very high, will be improved by the introduction of global training, by the allocation of responsibilities, by improving management and by a number of other changes that will be introduced.Cultures are structural and systems products, and structures and systems have become old.By renovating them, sometimes in a very radical way, will help us those who, in the Commission, resolutely seek the European ideal and whose capacities are very high, to make talents expressing and what they manifest as never before they have done.I would like to make a last remark in response to Mr. Harbor.	fr
Finally, I would like to add that I had my doubts about government formation in Austria last week.However, I have no concerns to discuss and criticize Austrian asylum policy.I hope the commitment of this plenary will be just as large.Mr. President, during the last financial foresight for the period 1994-1999 with a total of 13 different initiatives, was of great importance to the cross-border Interreg II initiative.In my opinion, the fact that the Interreg initiative is the upcoming round of the structural funds in the period 2000-2006 is a clear evidence of the rank that the EU member states attach to it.The Interreg-I program in the period 1989-1993 and the Interreg-II program in 1994-1999 have proven to be an outstanding success in terms of approaching social and economic development between neighboring Member States.In my homeland, the border counties in the northwest of Ireland, I have been able to pursue the important role that Interreg I and II have played in recent years, so I look forward to Interreg III with great joy.The Commission approved the Interreg III program of £ 67 million, which are to be used to continue the development of economic projects for municipalities on both sides of the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.The European Union played a major role in the development of these border regions in the many years.With its contribution of 80 million pounds for the International Fund for Ireland, the EU is the largest sole proprietor, and it also contributes 75 % of the funds for the program to support peace and reconciliation.All in all, Interreg, the International Fund for Ireland and the program for peace and reconciliation, have made a decisive contribution to promoting the peace process.Mr President, I will limit myself to some critical aspects with my explanations of Interreg, also to adhere to the speaking time at your disposal.We supported the new edition of this program and the expansion of the intervention areas, not only in the area of ​​cross -border cooperation, but also in the context of transnational and interregional cooperation.Regardless of this, we are aware that most of the resources - between 50 and 80 % - will be reserved for cross -border cooperation, i.e. the orientation A of the Interreg III program;That is why we are still of the opinion that the decision to consolidate the current cooperation spaces in this direction with regard to the selection of the eligible regions is wrong and inconsistent.We hope and wish that the Commission would go into the point of view of the position of Parliament and not only pay it to formal recognition.The cross -border cooperation continues to refer almost exclusively to the mainland borders, and in the cases where exceptions to the maritime boundaries have been made, the corresponding decisions are not transparent and often have to do with the fact that compensation to other fields of community policies should be created.The island areas that live in a regional situation that is inevitably connected to pure sea boundaries are particularly disadvantaged.This corresponds to continued discrimination, in the context of which the content of Article 158 of the contract, where the islands are mentioned in connection with politics to strengthen economic and social cohesion.	de
In one of the serious accidents that occurred lately, the goods that were transported themselves were not dangerous. Margarine and a few pounds of paint that, as a rule, did not pose dangers, caused a real destruction. Therefore, we need to consider how the requirements that will guarantee the maximum safety of security can be made even stricter. Finally, I would like to say that we should consider the issue of security in all types of transport. This week there will be a discussion here, in which we will talk about the safety of maritime transport due to the destruction of the ERIKA oil tanker, and we will have to discuss, during this year, on the goals of airspace safety. But I would like to say, dear gentlemen, that security is the primary objective of the committee. As I will say in the debate on the destruction of the Erika oil tanker, let's not expect a disaster to turn all our efforts on security, but let's work for it in the absence of such circumstances, which all they do is prove how much it is to be effective. I want to express my thanks once again to all those who intervened and especially to the rapporteur Mr. Koch. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00. Road Transportation of Dangerous goods The daily provision provides for the discussion of the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr. Koch, on behalf of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee, on the proposal of the European Parliament's Directive and the Council that amendes Directive 94/55/goods (com (1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083 (COD)). Mr President, Honorable Lady Commissioner, Dear colleagues, the Directive on the approach of the Member States' laws on the road transportation of dangerous goods entered into force on January 1, 1997, includes certain transitional provisions, the validity of which is limited and linked to the completion of some work with the proceedings. EET, that is, the European Committee on Standardization. The delays noted during EET's work now lead to problems in the application of this Directive. In particular, there are annexes that cannot be harmonized in accordance with technical and industrial development. I am sorry for that, because now we have to be active, because others did not do their job. However, I accept the submitted proposal for the amendment of Directive 94/55/EC which is currently being discussed. The European Union's possible inactivity would force Member States to amend their internal provisions for a short period of time - and in particular until the end of EET's work, which would cause unnecessary costs and insecurity. Therefore, the amendment of the directive set in today's agenda does not amend the harmonization of dangerous goods in the community. All he does is extend the validity of transitional rules by transferring dates, abolish non -relevant provisions, and regulate procedures for a) the AD hoc transfers of dangerous goods, and (b) the issuance of less strict national provisions, in particular with regard to local transport of minimal amounts of hazardous areas.	el
However, the problem of so -called racism is not to find the truth or even support ... Member Schulz, my family has never accepted the German officer, and it will not change your attitude!... and not even support, as I said that should be given to migrants. No, the problem is to suppress all the efforts that may arise in the nations to prevent the destruction of their migrants. Religion of anti -racism has its faith, priests, inquisitor and witch trial. History strongly condemns this miserable ideology that we proudly defend at every turn. John Locke, English philosopher, once said that the country without law is without freedom. With 50 years since the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights, 20 years have passed since the Helsinki decision document has been 10 years since the Berlin Wall has been fractured and the year has been the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, there are still provisions in the Constitution, which are no common in modern Europe. For example, Viktor Emanuel, Italy, had to leave his home country in Italy as a 9-year-old child and has not been able to return there for 53 years. If he sails from his home from his home to Italian regional waters, coastal guards are alerted to the site using modern satellite technology and is advised to return by loudspeaker. His 28-year-old son has only been in Italy once when his aircraft was directed to Milan Airport due to poor weather. The police surrounded the machine and was forbidden to leave the machine. What does he have to do with what his grandfather did during the reign of the fascists? According to a recent opinion poll, 80 % of Italians believe that they should be able to return without restrictions. Neither is a threat to the Italian state. This is not just a question about some people, as some have tried to claim;It is directly linked to the fact that the European Union is committed to respecting the human rights agreement, its own agreements and the rule of law. There is a lot of talk about the fundamental rights book. Such a speech rubs in its emptiness, unless the parliament first strives to intervene in the event of a breakdown of the Treaty. I feel deep and sustainable love for Italy and its people, but today I have to say to you and the Italian President Ciamp that Italy had no moral or legal right to sign the Amsterdam Treaty because it had not removed this very blatant infringement of this Convention. This also applies to Austria, where Otto von Habsburg was required to ban his own identity and give up his and his / her family members to reach Austria. In my opinion, the rights under the agreement are not conditional. The establishment agreement does not discriminate against individual families and thus break the agreement. The right to get to its own country, live there and die there are basic, holy rights, and I hope the Parliament respects them. I therefore recommend 41 and 42 to the Parliament. Mr President, respect for human rights, is the foundation of the European Union. It is mentioned in the establishment agreements and we keep up with it. Therefore, it is good that the European Parliament draws an annual report on respecting human rights in the European Union. Although I have only been a member of this Parliament since last year, I know that this annual human rights report has always been a lot of political unrest and confusion in recent years. Restlessness is justified due to the nature of the subject, but there is no confusion. Therefore, I am very pleased that this year has been a report that is very balanced and businesslike, despite the small problem that colleague Schulz has already talked about and we also have to hear some of the fairly pathetic statements here. Fortunately, by drumming our tables, we can announce that we do not accept this.	fi
Mr President, it took us twenty -five years to reach a common position that represents a true compromise. I would like to congratulate Mr Lannoye, a MP with remarkable abilities, who supported his view from beginning to end with vigor and belief. But he underestimated his contribution to this debate, because his own work as well as the work of others was what led us to a position that can be correctly considered compromise. Those who deny this and claim that our position is still completely blocking any progress in reality they admit - as they want to reject the common position in tomorrow's vote - that they do not want this directive at all. They do not want to see the addition of vegetable fats anywhere, in any Member State, in any form, for anything that bears the name of chocolate. This is a position that both the majority of the Member States and the majority of European Union consumers could not even accept for a moment, and I would like to take advantage of the little time I have at my disposal to support the opposite. If we move on and leave the harmonization at zero level percent of vegetable fats, which has always been among the arguments of the campaign, we are proceeding with a position where we are seeking safeguards for consumers, primary producers, and especially for the specifications we set for ourselves. The amendments presented before the Environment Committee, in addition to some which were accepted, were devastating amendments. They sought to postpone, throughout the term of this Parliament, but also throughout the term of this Commission, the approval of any resolution on this issue, which is unacceptable. These amendments requested that impact evaluation studies be carried out before the Directive itself entered into force or requested any additional signage in addition to the double marking on the package, which is provided here for consumers. My team supports the common position with some exceptions, and they will all be heard in this discussion. We believe that it is good for consumers, who are given the greatest selection of products as well as a separate and distinct marking. It is also good for producers of all vegetable fats, and I say this to cocoa butter producers. Cocoa butter is the main ingredient of all kinds of chocolate, and will continue to be, even for those who have presented the natural vegetable fats, a specific list, which can only be modified by the opinion and consent of the European Parliament. If I fell from Burkina Faso or Mali or one of the countries that produce Kariti butter and told me that the cooperatives of women who collect the fruits of the trees from which this butter is produced, and who are an important part of the exports of these countries to Europe, they will become illegal,I would be very angry. The last observation that allows me to make the time I have at my disposal is aimed at the quality chocolate producers with the special methods we find in Belgium and some other places.	el
I would like to ask the Commissioner whether this principle is actually applicable and whether we will receive any compensation from the people mentioned.The second question refers to the announced commission of the Commission on Environmental Liability, which is intended to ensure that the pollutant principle will apply in the future and that we have better opportunities to implement European environmental legislation accordingly.The white book admits that the cause can only be held responsible if it has been determined if the damage is quantifiable and a causal connection is undoubtedly proven.The accident of Erika is an example par excellence;This is exactly what the white book is about here.It can therefore become a benchmark of how to deal with problems of this kind in the future.The proposed guideline provides for a strict liability for damage that goes back to dangerous activities regulated by the EU.My concern goes there, and maybe the commissioner can comment on whether the white book for environmental liability is actually the right means of dealing with problems of the size of the Erika shipwreck.If it actually does justice to the requirements or will continue to get away from ship Shavaria on the high seas without having to pay for the damage.Mr President, we would like to express our sympathy and solidarity to the people and regions affected by the disaster.But good intentions alone are not sufficient, but a replacement must be made for the damage and the failures must be compensated for, both in terms of restoration of the environment as well as the mussel breeding facilities and the fishing equipment.We welcome that the Lord spoke of the fact that it is necessary to act and compensate for it quickly and retrospectively.We also complain about the careless control of the ships and support the creation of a European coast guard and in particular the demand for stricter legal regulations and for ships with a double outer skin.We continue to denounce the practice of pleasure flags in both merchant ships and fishing vehicles.Furthermore, we are shocked by the fact that the cargo was strongly carcinogenic due to the content of polyaromatic hydrocarbons of over 1000 ppm.This means that under the 15,000 tons of oil that came into the sea were 15 tons of highly toxic products.This is unacceptable.We also learned it too late, so that medical check -ups are now particularly necessary for the volunteers who have worked with great commitment to restoring the environment.In our opinion, the prevention against such risks and scientific research to prevent and eliminate damage must apply special attention.Numerous suggestions have been made that should be checked.Solutions for disaster cases cannot be found at the last moment, but it must mainly be traded in advance.Mr President, over two months after Erika's accident, the already cleaned coastal sections are repeatedly dirty.I would like to express my solidarity with the victims again and appreciate the high commitment of the volunteers and specialists who are still working on cleaning the dirty beaches.As a result of the mobilization on site, to whose mouthpiece our house made a debate and the assumption of a resolution on February 20, the announcement of a first package of measure has occurred.	de
With this spirit thank you very much. Mr President, the reports we heard are being shown in the right direction, but we cannot subscribe to indications of self -satisfaction regarding the current conditions. In order to be effective the fight against discrimination requires more wider and above all more practical measures. Thus, with regard to access to public service jobs, we must abolish any restriction associated with nationality. Community institutions and states must set the example. Also, a complete citizenship presupposes the right to vote for extraterrestrials inhabited in the Union and this applies to all elections. As long as the extravagers are set aside by political rights, they will be a goal of demagogic lectures and discrimination measures. If the taxpayer's status justifies their access to this right, why limit it to local and European level? Finally, the legalization of all illegal immigrants is imperative in Europe to allow the fight against the illegal movement of labor and xenophobia that recently erupted in Spain. This presupposes the annulment of the provisions of the Schengen Treaty, and the conditions of Amsterdam and Dublin, which constitute a real insult of asylum. Finally, we believe that the fight against racism does not depend mainly on the legal arsenal, however good it is, but on specific measures to eliminate unemployment and exclusion and in this field we should act. Mr President, we can write what we want about human rights and we can also write reports on the subject and examine it, but if we do not act our intentions and reports, then they have no meaning. They collect dust on the committee's shelves and the offices of persons and governments with good intentions. We must take leadership initiatives, as the media, educational institutions and churches have to do. Such leadership initiatives have not taken in the past. Shame on us that we ignored Mozambique for such a long time and that we did so little, so late. We are a continent that sends weapons worth 2 billion US dollars to Ethiopia, affected by drought and we cannot find two helicopters urgently to send to Mozambique to save people who are drowning. Shame ours and other European instruments that we cannot react to this kind of disasters. We are ashamed of allowing children to die in Iraq at a rate of 5000 per month. Half a million children have died once sanctions were implemented. The barbaric war in Iraq continues. The bombings continue with relentless intensity in secret. It is a war against children and innocent citizens of the country. We must intervene in cooperation with the Security Council individually and collectively, in order to ensure the transfer of medicines to these people. We are ashamed of the sale of weapons and equipment in the area of ​​the big lakes. Our shame in the European Union that we do not exclude racism and xenophobia, endemic characteristics in my country and in the EU in general. Racism is a crime - a crime that is not prosecuted in the Union.	el
Let me give you an example, since my speech time does not allow me to develop this idea. Let's take the reform proposed about the procedures on infringement. What is suggested on this issue? Simply put, it is proposed to grant the resources needed at each level, instead of meeting Parliament's demands for the creation of a real procedural administrative law for the purpose of security of law, necessary in terms of European citizen, that is, in terms of the one who can initiate the process. It is simply said that this procedural administrative law will not be created, but that the requests will be selected. In what way? In the way these things are chosen, completely arbitrarily. In the opinion of this kind of parliament, derogations cannot be accepted. We understand that the Commission must be reformed, we agree with the objectives of this reform, but of course not at a price, for the sake of an important interest that we all embrace - such as the protection of community's financial interests - to throw aside the great boost of European construction, which we must first. Thank you, Mr. Prodi, for your presentation and documentation. I congratulate you that you used the internet for the general public - a very good idea. I will start from trade. We agree with you that we need a rules -based trade system. Is necessary. Seattle failed because especially the USThey have proved incapable of arresting how legitimate are political such as environmental protection, maintaining agricultural communities through common agricultural policy, animal protection, health sector and social rights. It has shown incredible analgesia as to the reasonable concerns of the developing world and, sincerely, the developing world has not many reasons to date the WTO. We look forward to continuing the EU negotiations, strongly maintaining our position on all these issues and using our links with developing worlds to ensure a fair next round. Could we please have detailed sentences within the next three months on how will this target be accomplished? Innovation and knowledge - elements that are very appropriate in the new century. How much did the Commission innovate, or if you want parliament? A few years ago we had a White Paper on Innovation. What happened since then? I would like to emphasize that we are particularly concerned about the continuity, and not only in excellent communications, which we welcome, but the continuity, the continuity, the continuation !!!! We are working on the fifth framework research program - but what happened to what we learned in the fourth? What about spreading new ideas, new products, new comparisons of socio -economic systems? To be continued again, please. We, incidentally, welcome the formation of a European sector of research, which you and the Busquin Commissioner have suggested. Excellent way to start the century. I welcome the forthcoming business announcement, but I hope before we go on to new projects we will look at the old ones.	el
It should also be emphasized that once again, the commission in fact is the problem of concrete actions in the equal opportunities sector.In conclusion, we are in the presence of a not particularly satisfactory document and, in certain points, disappointing.Berend report (A5-0107/1999) We agree, essentially, with the assessment and considerations of the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation, and the development of the regions of the European Union.We will therefore limit ourselves to emphasizing certain aspects only.First, as the Commission itself says, the fact that the per capita GDP of certain poorest regions has increased sharply between 1991 and 1996 is to a large extent to the inclusion of the new German Länder in the calculations of the community average, from the first year.This fact is obviously at the origin of a significant reduction in the level of the GDP per capita of the Union.Then, it is particularly important for us to note that the recovery of certain regions - where it took place - was accompanied by a minimum increase in employment, which therefore requires new development strategies, with a major concern for this area.This situation contradicts the slowness of the adoption of employment promotion measures exclusively reserved for the internal policy of the Member States, as the report does.Finally, but this is not the least important aspect, we will mention the rapporteur's proposal to include in the future in this type of report, among other aspects, an analysis of the interregional evolution of cohesion in each state.The multiplicity of situations and the differentiated evolution from one region to another, within the same state, impose an in -depth evaluation of this question so as to allow and guarantee the correction of regional policies (and others) in order to ensure cohesion also inside each Member State.Given the employment situation in the community and the ambition displayed by the European Union to resolutely attack unemployment, the analysis of the concentrations made by the Commission should take into account other elements than competition.I want for example the restructuring of the ABB-Alsthom Power company, including a large delegation of employees from all over Europe is present today in Strasbourg.The management of Abb-Alsthom Power, which results from a merger carried out in June 1999, announced a restructuring with already prospects for job cuts in a number of countries.This harmful situation for employment poses many questions, in particular on the information given to the European works council which has existed since 1996. This implies updating and strengthening the community directive on European works councils.This also implies control of concentrations which takes into account employment, the environment and consumers.The report of the Economic and Monetary Commission being insufficient from this point of view, I abstained.By claiming to apply the principle of subsidiarity at the level of the European competition policy, the Commission decentralizes for the benefit of the national authorities and courts the responsibility for decisions and abuse of dominant position compared to the business agreements which create distortions on the market, although the questions of concentration of companies and state aid remain in the notification regime.	fr
And the rapporteur on this issue eventually ends up in a very good position. The circulation of professional vehicles is a large number of kilometers annually and we cannot control their status effectively only with annual technical checks. Non -announced road controls are also essential because they are often circulated on the territory of the AEPHONE Missing heavy vehicles from third countries, which is a serious risk to safety. The revision of the Directive will greatly enhance road safety if the provisions are properly observed and we can establish effective, fair and deterrent sanctions for violations. The effectiveness of the directive will improve if the Member States can consult the harmonization of the sanctions system. However, this should not slow down the rapid position of the directive. An argument for immediate revision of the directive gives a recent example from Finland. In eastern Finland, just a while ago, during a surprise check, police and audit services conducted a check on 62 heavy vehicles. The 33 of them was imposed a fine and 16 recommendations were made. Three vehicles were completely prohibited to continue the trip. Only 13 vehicles were in a fully acceptable situation. A significant part of the poor vehicles came from third countries. The worst case was a Polish semi -trauma truck, whose driving vehicle had no brakes at all, the cargo packaging was lacking and the brakes of the vehicle had a long leak. Anyone can imagine what a danger to road safety is such a semi -trauma truck on snowy and frozen roads. Our team supports amendment no.3 and wishes the revised directive quickly. Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, have been said many nice words about this directive and thanks to Mr Piecyk, but because of some developments, I would like to add something in the meantime. Recently, and after discussing the Directive in the Commission, I asked the Mrs Commissioner about the fact that drivers coming from countries outside the EU are leading to the EU and take advantage of the way drivers are controlled during the technical inspections of their cars. What is happening, in principle, is: Guides who do not have a work permit in an EU state and who have no employment relationships outside the EU, take advantage of the situation to drive vehicles registered in a particular country and are in accordance with all controls, but outside the country in which they are registered. In these countries, at present, there is no control of employment licenses and possible labor relations. So, in other words, I would like to argue in favor of non -direct inclusion in the directive of this issue in order to use the scope of the Directive to seek to solve the problem in this respect. Mr President, Mrs Vice -President, Honorable Ladies, Honorable Gentlemen, Security on our streets is the great concern of all of us.	el
This is the first issue. The second question concerns the problem called Summit for Employment. I was convinced, until I watched the discussions that led to the registration of employment problem on the Council's agenda and that of the European Union, that the Summit for Employment was primarily aimed at combating the problems not of the new economy of knowledge, but the old European economy,And blacksmiths, and that these were the employment problems initially presented as issues of the agenda for the Summit for Employment. Consequently, it is important to ask the following question: When we talk about the problems of the new economy of knowledge, the new digital economy - which I know has not created employment in Europe, but rather unemployment - do we replace the inability to deal with the problems of unemployment today,We are the important role played by the Internet, the digital economy and the knowledge economy, but it was not the original goal of the Employment Summit. The main chairman of the Council ended his intervention with a tone somewhat ideological, again well. If this is the social democratic policy on the economy of the future, then I should remind you that one of the most serious problems regarding the internet economy and Europe's delay is the lack of business spirit observed in the education system, in the action of governments, in the functioning of the institutions. And that is what we need to fight to secure an economy of the knowledge of the future. Mr. President of the Council, first of all, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament, especially to emphasize with your presence what the European Socialist Party Chairman already said, the political symbolism that has the fact that in the middle of your tour of the various capitals. This is not the first time that there has been a different and politically encouraging correlation between the Council and Parliament, but it is really a major move, as my colleague Barsn Crespo said. Our position is clear. We support the Portuguese government's initiative and support it because it is a serious initiative as well as because of its content, either in terms of strategic goals or other goals we share. After all, the way the Council prepares is very indicative of this. First of all, we have the very serious and detailed document submitted in January. Next, we have the various preliminary conferences, the contribution of businessmen or trade union representatives to this summit. And above all, the latest contribution given to the research level at the recently held conference, where Nobel laureates and Ministers of Science and Technology met. This is serious, pays close attention to the preparation of the summit.	el
How do we implement what is relatively detailed in the contracts for development aid programs?Some MPs, Mr. Ferber and Mr. Cushnahan, talked about the gap between the Sunday speeches and reality.Herr Cashman verwies darauf, daß man Taten nicht durch Worte ersetzen könne, was in gewisser Weise durchaus richtig ist.Of course you can achieve something with words, as Ms. Malmström said.She explained that she received a letter from the Chinese ambassador, an extremely gracious and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, in which he informed her that she was wrong and the European Parliament with his attitude with regard to the question of human rights in China.I think Ms. Malmström will receive a true flood of letters from the Chinese authorities after her speech.She will then be able to fill an entire file cabinet about the supposedly real situation in China.The view of many non -governmental organizations and many people who admire Chinese civilization, but are concerned about the current events in China, have been given.It is completely right to think about what we can do.In the first speech, Mr. Salafranca mentioned two areas in which, apart from the conference in Geneva, measures are taken.One of these measures has become possible due to the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayers: the budget that is available to us for strengthening human rights, and in which around 100 million euros are provided for the programs falling into my area of ​​responsibility.This money is largely awarded to the non -governmental organizations and are used there to promote human rights and the process of democratization.Together with the parliament, we will discuss how we can best design and align these spending programs to promote human rights in the next few years.There is also the question that Mr. Salafranca pointed out, which unfortunately can no longer be present at the end of this short but useful pronunciation.It is also about our human rights policy in general and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy.Ich möchte das Parlament daran erinnern, daß die Kommission bis Mitte des Jahres umfassend und theoretisch gut begründet darlegen wird, weshalb die Menschenrechte in den Mittelpunkt der Entwicklungspolitik und der Gemeinsamen Außen- und Sicherheitspolitik gestellt werden sollten.This is of the greatest importance, and if I hadn't already been convinced, after today's remarkable speech by Mr. Havel, I would certainly have reached this view.This debate was very useful.I hope there will be other pronunciations like these.I would also welcome to talk about how we can implement these good intentions where it is important, where people are still tortured and raped, and where people still keep their civil rights ahead, which this house, as well as me, is taken for granted.I received 7 decision -making applications in accordance with Article 37 paragraph 2 of the rules of procedure to conclude this declaration.The pronunciation is closed.The vote takes place on Thursday.Cyprus and Malta According to the agenda, the common pronunciation follows:	de
"I say this to make a member Schulz understand the matter. Mr President, Mr Member of the Commission, Good Colleagues, I fully understand my colleague di Pietro's disappointment, as he had to do a lot of work in a short time so that he could have presented this report to us today. The European Union's crime has increased to such an extent that we cannot be able to be satisfied with the need to gradually develop the legal aid of Member States related to criminal matters. There is no reason to scroll through the European Parliament's neck. The governments of the Member States have made the space so small. Therefore, the European Parliament will be able to handle an almost impossible task. It must be satisfied with the idea that all means, even if they are minor, must be introduced to provide better legal aid. I could say paradoxically that it would be best best to say as little as possible of this report, because the clearer we make it only about small steps, the more criminals rub their hands and the better the steep mismatch between organized crime and legal cooperation. This is why I urgently appeal to the Council so that it finally looks at the truth in the eyes, and in particular the fact that legislation has been lagging behind crime. After all, the goal is to give the judiciary - primarily to the courts, but also to the citizens concerned - the tools for opposing crime without breaking the basic right of defense and the general principles of human rights. If this is not done, we really do unnecessary work. Indeed, I call for the continuation of the criminal law of the Member States of the European Union. In my opinion, it is only in this way that crime can be resisted appropriately and beyond borders. As long as this harmonization has not been carried out, we must be consistent if we want to make mutual legal aid possible. Therefore, I have submitted a revision stating that legal aid can only be given only if the authorities are prosecuted on the basis of matters that are punishable by national law in the Member State and the Member State for which help is sought. By the way, the content of my check can be found in the check 43, which also presents this cumulative condition. This cumulative condition is essential, as I think you have to respect the principle of the criminal law ""no punishment without laws"". The result is that every request for a legal aid, which is made on the basis of a default, is not punishable in the Member State underlying a request for assistance, is in conflict with the principle of legality and thus with the principles of the right of the Member State. It is therefore very important that this cumulative condition is accepted. In the end, I think that my colleague di Pietro has done a great job in drawing up a report that, within limited opportunities, provides all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual rights and basic freedoms. However, if we want to give the European Union a greater sense of security, we need to do more work to achieve legal cooperation. The Mr President, my group, is pleased to have an agreement in order to provide a law on mutual assistance in criminal cases, which is already given in practice. The purpose of the legislation is to define the rights and obligations between citizens or between citizens and citizens and the state. The present proposal is complicated as it deals with agreements between Member States, but has a far consequence of the relationship between citizens and the state. There are major shortcomings in the Council's proposal in the area of ​​legal protection. According to the rapporteur di Pietro, there are even huge flaws in the proposal. The agreement will allow for a chain of legal aid requests for each part of the chain towards the authorities and criminal systems of more and more Member States. The way this is organized ensures that no judge can overall this chain. Therefore, complementary measures, such as, for example, a criminal investigation authority is required to prove on request in every criminal case that uses the material obtained by these authorities."	fi
We are in a historical situation in which negotiations are made with 12 countries or negotiations are taken, and now we are together in a situation in which the growing together in Europe can become reality in a manageable time.But how should the Union be expanded, if not now - d.h.Before the expansion - nails are made with heads?That is why we are a parliamentary group for the government conference.We find them indispensable and urgently and hope that it will indeed produce the results that make an early expansion of the European Union possible.My parliamentary group, Herr Council President, has taken note of the fact that the President of the Council is not satisfied with the current situation.Therefore, they are assured that the Confederal Group of the United European Left / Nordic Greens will also be involved in the fact that the Union is finally doing its homework.It is no more and no less than the future of Europe, and above all it is about a Europe that actually understand citizens as theirs because they can help shape it and because the concerns and needs, the problems and questions they move every day are taken seriously by politics.Politics of the closed doors, advice in the quiet closet, all of this must be part of the past.Therefore, transparency is necessary.I think you as a presidency should ensure that the train does not roll as before and that people are not left behind on the platforms like contract analephables.We consider it indispensable that not only everything is being done in order to comprehensively inform the citizens about the course and the results of the government conference, rather they have to be included directly in the entire reform process.We also find that the political decision -makers must finally jump over their shadows and the citizens have to question in referenders after the end of the government conference whether they agree to how their Europe will develop in the future.In fact, we have a Europe of the citizens, and we indeed have a completely new quality of democratic legitimation of the Union.I want to clearly address another central democracy.As a member of the convent, which has now started his work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I want to say clearly: A solemn proclamation of the Charter is not enough for me and my faction.What will the citizens say if the rights are solemnly announced, but they cannot sue them individually?No, I think that would only deepen the Union's credibility crisis.The low participation in the European elections should be really alarm signal enough.What we need are for every and every visible right, the fundamental rights charta must become legally binding for all people who live in the Union for all their citizens.In the interests of the citizens, we should work together, and I expect the government conference that the decision of Cologne will be revised here at the end of the year.Of course, it is also about efficiency of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 or more Member States.	de
I hope you all agree that this is a significant progress. Parliament defended the appropriations without stimulating the Council's very scarce original offer. In the end, we had to hold several meetings before the Council finally raised its offer to a significant amount. We received a 2 million increase in the Council on behalf of the Council, which was a decisive increase. I can recommend it to you, and the Commission assured that it could implement programs with that amount. This was a significant aspect to us. However, I would like to say that the budget has now and have always been very modest, and thus the budget for this program is rather symbolic than real. Energy savings will continue to come mainly from Member States. We need to remember when we accept this program. It is a pity if the achievements of the community level are symbolic rather than real, since energy saving measures, including community activities, are very enthusiastic about the local level. The community can intervene by promoting the communication of local actors so that the bike does not need to be reinvented in every area. The community and the European Union have an important task in this matter. The Save program is the only community-wide program that promotes rational use of energy. It focuses on non-technical areas and helps to create energy efficiency infrastructure, and the aim of the program is to create an environment that can promote investment and energy efficiency. We also need to understand that the energy saving industry also has market outlook. We have heard a lot about the difficulty in competition for renewable energy sources, but energy efficiency saves business money, it actually saves everyone's money and therefore should not be related to problems. We can all support it. I have to say about energy savings, as well as motherhood, that even though we all support it, sometimes we do very little real and concrete things to help people who promote mothers or energy savings. We could do more when we think that we are committed to reducing CO2 and greenhouse gas emissions and reducing dependence on import energy. Nowadays, we do not act as citizens want. We do not act so that citizens could do something concrete, either at home or at work or in the industry to support actions against climate change. If we were able to convey this, it would be very interesting. Once again, I would like to thank all those who helped in this mediation process. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, I would like to re -thank Parliament member Ahernia for his work as a presenter of this proposal, as he, together with other members of the Parliament, has finally produced a sensible solution that improves even some of the Commission's own proposals and, of course, which the Council had originally approved for budget. As Ahern aptly said, the budgets of the clay and Altener programs are, above all, symbolic, as the heaviest burden-bearing countries, Union Member States, regions or even cities in some cases. In any case, even though the budgets are relatively small, they are still symbolically important, which means that the whole community wants to support such actions that can actually fulfill our Kyoto commitment, and that we can also diversify our energy sources, increase our acquisition, and in the case of clay, reduce energy consumption, thus increasing energy efficiency. In addition, these programs, that is, the SAVE program on energy efficiency and energy savings and renewable energy resources, have a really important technological objective that, from an economic point of view, can open up significant opportunities for industry and workplaces in our Member States and, consequently, in the European Union. As regards the processing of Parliament, I would like to repeat my thanks to all those who have worked and participated in the discussion, above all, for the rapporteur, since the proposal approved by the Council has included most of the Parliament's checks, in this case virtually everything, albeit slightly modified, and since the financial sum has been raised compared to the original proposal.	fi
With a Commission member Schreyer now in Schwarzwald in the coming days, a single farmer may ask how the Commission can now help me. How can Europe help me? What do you say to the forestry person when his condition may not be located in target 2 or target 5B? How does the Commission intend to respond during the visit itself, when you, a member of the Commission, tells the forest owner that we support road construction and dams, and want to rebuild cultural heritage, make offers for tourists, etc.? All of these are good advice. However, I personally come from the Northern Germany forestry area and I tell you that we already know these huge damage there. The necessary thinning fellings will not be continued and the forests will not be sufficiently managed. What we need urgently, according to the Commission's view, is also a positive response to national subsidies, so that we do not discuss some competition situations again. Mr President, Member of the Commission, Good Colleagues, Allow me to refer to two things first. First of all, at the beginning of 1999, NATO and most of the Member States of the European Union bombed Kosovo in the name of freedom. Now we try to get it back on our feet and help it with its people at a huge economic cost. Rightly. Secondly, at the end of 1999, incredible storms raged and brought death and destruction to large areas of land in the EU. The Commission in Brussels responded to the cries for assistance to those concerned with a shrugging. We have no funds or opportunities for it, said. Good colleagues, it's wrong! Nobody can understand it either. At least not the one who has to fear for their livelihood. Citizens of the European Union are expecting solidarity, including within this community. I think they have the right to demand solidarity. In times of need, the European Parliament must ensure that this requirement will also be met. I demand that the Commission will no longer make the concern for the person concerned and that the Commission is approaching the victims of the storm with help. It knows the tools and means better than any organization or authority itself. Good colleagues, I ask you for your support when it comes to making it clear to the Commission that there are less opportunities to provide assistance than good will in a few in Brussels! Allow me to make another comment: in the consequences of the storm, it is not so clearly revealed, but the tanker accident off the French coast makes it quite clear that we still have to help the Commission in another case. The European Union urgently require rules on environmental responsibility. It is no longer the case that citizens must take responsibility for the damage that individuals or parties have often caused by criminal projects. We have to liable for all kinds of damage to our environment. Then, for example, everyone is considering whether they allow oil to carry oil in a tanker at the decomposition point. When I came in 1994, more than five years ago, to the committee on the legal matters of this Parliament, I was able to take the report as a rapporteur in the field of environmental responsibility. Since that day, I've been waiting for an initiative from the Commission that also employs me. It's a scandal that will have to end soon and I hope that this document will not be postponed once again in February! Mr President, a Member of the Commission, this millennium storm should actually make us think about the problems. It has become clear that one is still unable to avoid natural disasters. They have always been and will always be. In this context, of course, solidarity is needed. Certainly, European -wide civil protection is needed, and the EU budget must also include a budget for natural disasters. But - and this is most important - in a relationship between nature and man, only a person makes mistakes - even though they are often made over the centuries - and never nature, because nature cannot make mistakes.	fi
In this area of ​​responsibility, the European Union plays a certain role, but we cannot raise the claim to quickly restore structures that, as the woman correctly said, were not the best even before the military campaign in Kosovo.In addition, it does not seem to me that, Ms. Ms., that the military actions in Kosovo contributed to such massive destruction of the structures of the healthcare system that they have had a direct impact on the situation as we have now experienced.What we are currently experiencing has to do with the dramatic situation of the resettled population, with a number of economic factors and with the level of satisfaction of the elementary needs in healthcare as a result of the general deregulation of the organizational structure of the administration in Kosovo.This central question is based on the entire current situation.If we do not solve the political problem, which has to be done in the United Nations Resolution in question, then there is no solution to the problem of child health and not for other areas of development in this region.I would like to expand the debate in the situation in Mitrovica.There, the international community has rebuilt the hospital with the help of Europe.However, it is in the northern part of the city, so that access to the hospital is extremely difficult for the Kosovo-Albanians.Accordingly, the Kosovo albanians are excluded from any medical help.Since this is also the case in other places in the country, tensions between Kosovo albaniums and Serbs are created, nobody trusts anyone anymore and Albanians do not want to be supplied by Serbs and vice versa.I understand when they say, rightly that the European Union must work in a larger international association.But where will you focus?What will you do to ensure that the Kosovo Albanians can also be treated in a hospital, including that of Mitrovica?Mr, the Mitrovica problem is well known.It is a very specific situation with high -grade tensions between the ethnic groups, which fortunately do not achieve the same danger in other areas of Kosovo.I understand the worries of the MP.However, I would like to tell him that Bernard Kouchner followed a line in this matter, namely to preserve what is based on the United Nations Resolution in question, i.e.h.To try to create prerequisites for multi -ethnic structures that can serve the individual communities, including the various administrative levels.I think that with this question we should not make any premature judgments about the responsibilities because several main actors occur.The location in Mitrovica is deplorable, it is shaped by specific tensions, and I think positive measures for security in this area have been taken in the past few hours.However, I would like to tell you that we have no capacity for police forces - this has to do with the contributions of the Member States - in order to be able to guarantee what we had taken on the measures after the military action, that is, the establishment of mechanisms of cooperation between the individual ethnic groups, which are sufficient and in particular access to the hospital facilities.	de
However, this gives the impression that this growth, which is first and foremost on the performance of the United States, then to the productivity gains of the new economy, the new information and communication technologies, is even driven by the general course of the world despite our handicaps.We know these handicaps well, which urgently need to remedy this, the structural rigidity as well as excessive taxation.However, we do not forget that a new handicap has been added with the common currency.The uniform currency policy and the gradual adaptation of the other policy areas bring additional rigidity for the countries of the euro zone by impecating them that are not necessarily in accordance with their respective structures and economic conditions.This standardization is assessed as positive in the Commission's report.In truth, however, it cannot be ruled out that it leads to a global situation that is anything but optimal.If one also takes into account the strangeness of a unit currency that is not based on a state that in turn relies on a people, it is easy to explain what remains a major mystery in Brussels, the distrust of the markets compared to the euro.Certainly, the weakness of the common currency still had its good at the beginning of 1999 because it favored growth in an unexpected way, but in the long run it cannot be hidden that it is actually the symptom of poor politics and poor functional conditions.President!The present draft decision is controversial.This is hardly surprising with regard to its object.Among economists, there is always no agreement, especially when it comes to the future.The carefree plea of ​​the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems to be an attractive way to combat high unemployment.In reality, however, this is a short -term policy.Even if the rapporteur advocates sustainable growth, this has nothing to do with sustainability.In view of the ecological and demographic developments, we should spur the member states for selective economic growth.More investments, production and consumption only bring prosperity in a short duration.The consumption of scarce raw materials and energy must be reduced noticeably.Further priorities are the repayment of high state debt and the restructuring of the pension systems.If the Member States do not do anything here, even fewer funds for healthcare, education and other important public institutions will be available in the future.A plea for more active state politics makes a rather strange impression.The latest reports of Eurostat on the increasing inflation, which is now 2 %, the permissible maximum value, are not taken into account.If you still want higher government spending, you should not be aware of the next interest rate increase by the European Central Bank for long.What the state can then create in workplaces is re -destroyed by the unfavorable developments, especially for small and medium -sized companies.The high unemployment in the European Union worries us all, especially since the declining tendency does not seem to last.However, a long breath, a structural policy, is required to promote employment.The Member States in particular are responsible for pursuing a good policy.But you have to get enough scope for this.A solidification by impose social convergence criteria and other community guidelines will not contribute to the desired employment growth.	de
And, since today, it is Valentine's Day, as a former mayor of a regional city, I propose that we declared our love towards the European regions that need it.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Fischler, rural development must and may take into account three problems, namely the maintenance of employment, the protection of landscapes and especially the local culture, because it is important.The quality of life in rural areas can only be preserved permanently if the rural population maintains it.It is enough to observe what is happening in certain alpine regions to realize how much the consequences of the rural exodus are catastrophic.However, I warn you of the risk of transferring an urban culture in rural areas through these programs.We should also avoid creating subsidized structures, which depend on these subsidies eternally.To guarantee this sustainability -this is a term which, by the way, has become very hollow, but we all understand what it implies -, it is necessary to establish, in the countryside, links between, for example, tourism and agriculture.Investments must now have a visionary orientation.It is therefore imperative to associate the young and creative spirits from our campaigns there, because if they desert them, he may no longer pass much.We are not all loudly attached to sprinkling and not more to pilot projects which must, so to speak, have a snowball effect and generate other similar projects.I rather plead in favor of closed circuits.And even if leader I and leader II can have here and there accused certain deficiencies, these two initiatives have surely proven to be positive.I call my colleagues for reflection and their requests to take care not to make an exception for the Nordic countries, but to include mountainous regions, namely the Alps, the Pyrenees, the Sierra Nevada, of which I am from, especially with regard to the number of inhabitants and the density of the population.Mr. President, I would like to talk about the equal report, and in particular the policy of refugees.We had a very lively discussion last week about the constitution of the Austrian government.Today, we are already discussing the policy towards the refugees in the Austrian government coalition, since Ms. Stenzel, who wrote the Equal Report, represents the conservative party in power in Austria, and its policy.The most striking point of his first report was in the desire to limit aid to refugees to the small group of people than is the Geneva Convention, in other words, to those called the refugees subject to quota, or the United Nations refugees.In fact, it is the other refugees, those excluded from the quota and the support of the United Nations who most need help.The Employment and Social Affairs Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that the Equal program should apply to all refugees, on equal conditions.However, part of the employment and social affairs committee defended the proposal and formulations of Ms. Stenzel.This means, in my opinion, that Haider's policy already throws its shadow on this parliament.	fr
This point was postponed to the next March conference.He is still listed on today's agenda.Mr. Swoboda, I confirm what you just said.It is actually a printing error.The agenda, which was distributed, is not decisive because the decision was made to postpone the discussion about this point.Mr President, I would like to point out that this morning I noticed on the way to the plenum that two people smoked in front of the plenary hall.The smell is really disgusting!Please do something, on the other hand!I don't think I can do this, but I agree with them that a form must be found as soon as possible to educate those who do not adhere to the bans we have decided.As far as the flight delays and the resulting problems are concerned, those could merge - honestly, I do not know how many there were - who had difficulties to get to this conference to Strasbourg;Then you could check which problems actually occurred and to what extent.Coherence of the various Union politics With development policy on the agenda, the explanations of the Council and the Commission follow the coherence of the various Union policy with development policy.President!It is a great pleasure for me to turn to this parliament for the first time in the name of the Council Presidency, with which I am very important to the European Parliament, which is undoubtedly approaching the European Parliament when it comes to further shaping development policy at the level of the European Union, because I have the honor to give them an explanation of the coherence of the policy of the European Union in the development area todayto be presented.Of course, I would like to leave it up to the Commission to add some statements that I will have the opportunity to present.First of all, I would like to emphasize that we all find it necessary at the level of the European Union, the extraordinary development and progress that has been carried out in a large part of the living conditions, especially through the technological upswing, which has accelerated in the past few decades and was beneficial to the well -being and the improvement of living conditions broad layers of the world population with the fact thatHave further tightened the Disproportions between some regions and geopolitical rooms on earth.As a result, the stability of the international system is questioned and peace is threatened, from which all of us increase the moral obligation to put our politics as optimally as possible to ensure that we can ensure more stability and balance in the different rooms that form our earth.This results in a reassessment of development policy in the sense of an answer to the globalization of the economic and financial markets.As you have determined, the conditions under which these markets work are very distorted, which naturally requires significant corrections, which in turn - also inevitably - require new options for developmental policy.As a result, we stand on the threshold of a new paradigm for development policy, and this is necessary, as I would like to emphasize that our actions focus on four essential points of view:	de
The English philosopher John Locke once said that a country without laws is a country without freedom. Fifty years after the signing of the European Convention on Human Rights, twenty years after the final act of Helsinki, ten years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, and one year after the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, in the heart of Europe that do not have constitutional provisions in Europe. For example, Victor Emmanuel of Italy was forced to leave his homeland, Italy, at the age of nine, when he was a child without his own perception, and for fifty three years he could not return to it. If he sails from his home in Corsica in the direction of Italian territorial waters, the coastguard is mobilized, using modern satellite technology and commands him from loudspeakers to return. His 28 -year -old son has only gone to Italy once when the plane he was carrying was changed due to bad weather and landed in Milan. The plane was surrounded by police officers banning him from getting off the plane. What does this man have to do with what his grandfather did during the fascist period? According to a recent poll, 80% of Italians believe that people should be allowed to return without restriction. Nor are they reasonably a threat to the Italian state. This is not - as many have tried to support - on an issue that concerns only a few people. It reaches the heart of Europe's union commitment to respect the contract for human rights, its own conditions and the power of laws. There is a lot of talk about the map of human rights. Everything that is said will sound extremely shallow if this parliament does not first do what it can to deal with the present violations of the conditions. I speak as a man with a deep and steady love for Italy and her people, but what I want to today address you and Italian President Ciampi is that Italy had neither moral nor legal right to sign the Amsterdam Treaty, since she had not first removed her. There is also the case of Austria, where Otto von Hasburg had to deny his own identity and give up his rights and rights of his family members in order to enter Austria. The rights provided for in the Treaty do not depend on terms, in my opinion. The treaty does not discriminate against individual families and therefore a violation is performed. The rights to enter, to live and to deceive your home country are fundamental, sacred and inviolable and I hope the present parliament will support them. Therefore, I propose to this parliament to accept paragraphs 41 and 42. Mr President, respect for human rights is the foundation of the European Union. This is what the conditions define, and this is what we are constantly asking. That is why I find it useful to submit the European Parliament of Annual Report on the respect of human rights within the Union itself.	el
An ever -increasing part of public opinion in Scotland supports this view. Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads, undoubtedly, is nothing new. Has been repeatedly said in many circumstances. But this time it is true: we have put into operation - and it is extremely positive - the common currency and we have enlargement ahead of us. The question is: Will we move towards enlargement prepared or not? Are we in favor of enlargement without deepening or are we in favor of enlargement with simultaneous deepening? This is the issue and there is any discussion of the intergovernmental conference, its daily arrangement and the method. It is obvious that the Council, for the time being, did not choose the enlargement with simultaneous deepening. This is dangerous for enlargement. Dangerous for any prospect of a political union and, of course, incomprehensible to public opinion. The Council must take into account that if we want the future of the European Union to rely on a well -established enlargement, we must proceed far beyond the upcoming intergovernmental conference. The Council consults with us and his parliament provides his opinion. We want an intergovernmental conference, but not that. Should there be DS? Of course it should. But not this type of intergovernmental conference. We need to include much more issues on the agenda, we must be much more adventurous in issues that are the subject of the IMF and there must be much greater transparency and much more democracy. Greater democracy means to ensure greater involvement of the European Parliament, allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - the possibility of initiative. And undoubtedly, to set clear goals. The method of operation has reached its limits, good or bad. Until here we arrived by the method of operation. Was there any results? Yes, however, the point is to make a quality leap, and speaking in political terms it means, Mr. Chairman of the Council, to convince the other Community partners that to just get the least we can do at this stage. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, at this stage and at the end of this discussion that I watched with great care and very interesting, I would like to formulate some thoughts, filling in the orientations or positions I had in support of your prince in the past. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, your two rapporteurs, Mr. Dimitrakopoulos and Mr. Leinen, in the report they presented after an extremely accurate and serious work, have suggested that the parliament approve an official opinion under Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, thanks to this approval,February, as the Portuguese Presidency suggested. From our position and having formulated under the same Article 48 of the Treaty the opinion expected by the Commission, we are happy that this intergovernmental conference will begin earlier than it was initially expected.	el
I would have a little disagreement about the terminology you use, member Radwan when you said that you should now pay more attention to the needs of citizens than exclusively for competition. This idea is firmly controlled because competition exists for and only for them. Most companies do not like competition. The competition is guided and managed for the benefit of citizens, their financial interests and their freedom. Examples of liberalization and competition in Europe show that citizens have benefited from it. I can only say again that the Commission Member Bolkestein intends to deal with all the concerns in a more knowledgeable and detailed committee on Monday. Much thanks, the Member of the Commission. At the end of this debate, I have received a resolution submission for consideration in accordance with Article 42 (5) of the Rules of Procedure. I declare the conversation. We will submit a vote.(Parliament approved the resolution.) We have voted in favor of the resolution because a French Post's trade union made this request, hoping that in the case of an approved vote, they would be granted an extra time to defend their wage earners. This does not mean that we accept the entire content of the text, which is too vague and ignore the main thing. Politics of European institutions and national, especially French, government, is a reactionary policy that is equally well -defined as the benefit of the majority of users, the large population of the population. Postal services must be maintained as public services. All persons should provide services equal to their location or social status, on the same terms and conditions. All kinds of profitability thoughts should be excluded when it comes to organizing a public service, and private companies should not allow the storage of private profits by staring at the most profitable functions of the public service. Therefore, post office and similar organs should retain a monopoly on this service in different European countries. In order to ensure appropriate postal services in the European Union, it is necessary to end a policy aimed at eliminating the number of local posts, reducing the number of postal populations, and overwriting staff. On the contrary, we have to act in such a way that mail and generally all public service sectors would hire more staff. The usefulness of these jobs is an undeniable issue, and if the number of jobs were created, unemployment in Europe could be reduced. Mr President, I voted for this resolution myself, as the European Parliament must definitely discuss postal services and explore their current vague position. If we remove the public service, it is a very serious matter and we want to know the intentions of the Commission. When we are told that customers are served faster and cheaper, this is of course not true. Of course, people living in remote areas do not serve or have to pay expensive fees for which some of them cannot afford. Postal services are not only Posti's service but also a social service. The mail carrier is sometimes the only person they see during the day for some people. We can raise the hat for these mail carriers, who sometimes travel for miles on foot to bring this service to the most. Removing postal services, removing local contact services, would be a serious mistake, and we could not guarantee equality between all citizens. Profitability at all costs means a reduction in brotherhood and social cohesion. Mr President, I voted for this resolution and would like to explain the reason for it. Numerous speakers have reminded us that, especially in the mountains, the only person with whom the elderly keep some kind of contact is a mail divider. I agree with that attention. However, I think that the reduction of many pensioners for many pensioners depends on the state budget. In Italy, in my own country, there are about 200,000 Post employees and they pay the state about 50 million lira per year per person, or € 25,000. Thus, the total cost is approximately EUR 5 million.	fi
"It would be a great victory if we managed to export this model with the Macedonians to the rest of the West of the Balkans.This exemplary model also applies to regional cooperation.I fully agree with the rapporteur to say that it is necessary to find a balance, that it is necessary to encourage on the one hand regional cooperation and on the other hand, the opening towards Bulgaria and Greece and not isolate the latter.Mr. President, the Commissioner, if we are doing this first step, we will have already made a long way.If we slum it, we will have lost more.Mr. President, allow me first of all to specify that I do not see any problem with the idea of ​​providing support in principle to this very founded report.I simply mean highlighting a question that is missing in my opinion in the report and which presents a big problem for the Macedonians as well as for the effectiveness of the aid, financial or other, brought by the EU.I mean the sanctions taken from Yugoslavia.In order for my words to lend any misunderstanding, I also consider imperative to effectively oppose the Milosevic regime.But, first of all, these sanctions also affect many neighboring states, including Macedonia, in a global and negative way when they are already in a most difficult economic situation.Then, this political strategy on the political level and contravening the essential humanitarian principles has the effect of making the population of Milosevic and those around you.I therefore think that the subject debated today should lead us to demand a rapid judgment of the sanctions policy, as provided for in amendment 10. Mr. President, dear colleagues, it was not necessary to wait for the end of the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after several wars in the territory of the ex-Yugoslavia, with their procession of harmful effects on the stability of the regionBalkans, it is necessary to implement a global and sustainable strategy guaranteeing peace and stability in southeast of Europe.This strategy, which was materialized by the stability pact adopted on June 10, 1999, considers the region of Southeast Europe as an entity, but it recognizes, at the same time, the diversity and the inequality of the development of the different countries that compose it.The contribution of the European Union within the framework of the stability pact, translated into the said ""stabilization process and association"" relates to the development of the regional conception that the EC developed in 1996 for the five countries of the region, that is to say Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the old Yugoslav Republic of Macedia andAlbania, and whose most significant aspect is the establishment of political and economic measures intended to support the Dayton Peace Accords, which should thus contribute to the stability of the region.Consequently, the establishment of completely new bases establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, and the opening of this country to a prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through a system provided for in the stabilization and association process, constitute an important contribution for the stability of the Balkan region."	fr
"We have to support East Timor with all my might in achieving this goal.Human rights are so important within the parity assembly of AKP-EU that common vice presidents have been appointed who were specifically commissioned to follow the question of human rights carefully and to report on it to the meeting.A number of cases have been addressed, including the use of child soldiers in Sudan, where many children have been deported from neighboring countries.At the beginning of the fifth parliamentary term, I was elected European Copicite, Mr. Clair from Mauritius is the new AKP krepraue.I enter for a number of changes in our meeting, which are particularly necessary after signing the new agreement in May.We need a higher level of equality between our AKP partners and our European members, and the ""we-sie syndrome"" must be overcome.First, I enter for a parity assembly that belongs to the elected members from the AKP countries and no ambassadors or ministers of the respective governments as delegates.This is part of the new agreement.Second, according to the new agreement, regional meetings in the six regions are possible, through which we can work much more specifically in the future.These meetings are subordinate to the parity assembly.A regional debate that was extremely productive has already taken place in the Caribbean in Nassau.Another regional debate is to follow in Abuja in West Africa.I would like to convert the parity assembly in such a way that it is no longer a pure club to discuss, but a workshop in which it is working on improving living conditions for all people in developing countries.I want to give civil society a louder voice.To achieve this, we have to overcome corruption and address this goal directly.We have to reward the states that strive for a responsible state.However, we should also act hard against those states in which corruption is made or in which the pluralistic governments we demand are prevented under constitutional law.I am happy about the development in Zimbabwe.European taxpayers will no longer allow their money to be misappropriated.A wind of change must grasp Africa, new standards must be set and adhered to.Together with the Commission, the parity assembly should take on a leading role in monitoring the legal anchoring of the responsible government, human rights and democracy.I am sure that the elected delegates of the EU and the AKP countries have grown of this task.I ask you to support this report.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report.The basis of all considerations of development policy must be the attention of human rights and the fight against poverty.If poverty has to be combated, the lowering of the funds for the area of ​​development aid in many Member States and in the EU is in stark contradiction.When financing, the parity assembly must be provided with additional means with a look into the future, which serve to be able to send voting observers at the request of the AKP countries.In the future, the EU will have to orientate itself in the coordination of the development projects on the one hand, and on the other hand, better deny with the individual states in order to work more efficiently and use the means more effectively."	de
It is clear that this is a better control than the fact that the measurement is performed twice a year at a random time. According to experts, the cost is no higher because it is much cheaper to measure cumulative samples. Thus, the investment in the hardware needed for continuous sampling has been reimbursed within a few years. The proposal of the Commission was significantly improved in the first treatment with extensive support. Then the citizens woke up to expectations. I want to appeal to colleagues in order to meet these expectations. The coherent line of the European Parliament is a good thing for the trust of citizens, and in particular for the trust of citizens living near waste incineration plants or co -incineration plants. The Mr President, the Member of the Commission, is not very pleased with this directive because it seeks to combine two texts, one associated with burning hazardous waste and the other with harmless waste burning. This causes problems at several stages of waste incineration: waste reception, handling and storing it. So one might ask what was the motive for this merger. The answer can be found in Blockland's report. He furiously opposes parallel burning. However, paradoxical, however, the rapporteur also favors a blend of dangerous and harmless waste. How does this properly promote environmental protection? Our group hopes that neither burning method will be prioritized, as both are very useful for European waste management. It is necessary to take into account the existing practices of each Member State and maintain the balance between industrial sectors and to investigate how we can best protect the environment. This is proposed in a common position. The importance of the most toxic emissions of nox, dioxin and furan emissions must be emphasized. In addition, up to 2007, the common position proposes the NOX emission limit for incineration of hazardous waste, which is not yet valid. The limits of dioxins and furans have been made mandatory in all kinds of waste. To date, they were only applied to harmless waste. It is therefore unfortunate that the Blockland report proposes unrealistic solutions, although we know that many Directives on waste management are not yet applied to Member States or are poorly applied. Going too far is harmful. Reviewing the limits of this Directive every three years is completely unrealistic for the investments that industry must start. The industry requires legal security and reasonable deadlines. In reality, our problem is that Europe is not specified exactly what waste is. Thus, this causes a constant confusion when checking the texts on waste or when new suggestions have to be made. Mr Member of the Commission, a complete reform of European waste management is therefore very important. Mr President, I would like to start by congratulations on Parliament Blokland for this report. We know that waste burning is a very difficult and technical field, but I think this report is a commendable job. Unlike Grosstête, a member of the Parliament, I think that the common position and the Member of Parliament, Blokland's report, are a very essential environmental contribution to waste incineration, whether dangerous or harmless. I believe that we will get a good tool to prevent environmental damage related to waste incineration, and that we get a good tool that allows us to prevent and limit the risks of human health. Good ways are also introduced. Of course, I support the requirement that we have to draw up an actual waste management plan, which includes a plan for waste pre -sorting, that is, that waste incineration is associated with general EU waste legislation and that the problem of waste burning can be adapted to the waste hierarchy. I also find it good that it is now precisely defined what institutions these rules apply to and what types of waste they do not apply to. I would like to say for the difficult issue associated with the definition of parallel incineration plants, including the cement stoves, which have been lobbying quite strongly during this issue that I think we can support the review 43, which I think is a very common stance.	fi
It is true that financial aid in this direction is a fundamental element of the possibilities for activation to be given to those in the area. At this point I adopt the statement made by Mrs Doris Pack a while ago and I insist on the fact that we in the European Parliament have to respond to the responsibilities we have in this direction, but definitely demanding that we are not alone. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, initially I would like to thank the rapporteur, my colleague Brok. If the Council worked at the same speed as my colleague Brok, we would have really moved a lot more. The omission of the Council is really reprehensible. The rapporteur and the report correctly have the starting point that we should grant very quickly, but they are also justified as a starting point that this assistance should not be unconditionally and wherever it happens. I would like to point out in particular amendment 5 where it is clearly defined that from the credits of emergency financial aid can and should only be met by the needs of the Kosovo budget that arise in public, semi -governmental, community and other administrations and bodies that are directly or controlled by UNMik. UNMIK and the bodies created at the command of the United Nations and especially the fourth pillar and we cannot support the parallel structures created and still exist in Kosovo. What should be achieved with these funds? I want to refer to human rights especially. The West fought in Kosovo for human rights. But what's going on today in Kosovo? It has ended the great persecutions that the Serbs had begun, but on a daily basis there are unacceptable incidents where people are killed, or they are prevented from living where they want and as they want. The attacks on the Serbs, against the Roma against the Bosnians, are daily but still attacks on Albanians. I was frightened by the news, if it is true, of course, that an Albanian doctor who was working under very adverse conditions at Mitrovic Hospital in the Serbian sector eventually abandoned his position, from which he could help his compatriots because his life was threatened. These are episodes and situations that we cannot tolerate. I heard, of course, I don't know if it stands - that Serbs still operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are rumors that the Serbian militia is still acting. For me it does not play a role if the one who is threatened in Kosovo or loses his life is Serbian, Roma, Bosnian or Albanian. Nor is I interested in who is trying to bring about partition or secession. It is crucial for me to achieve the bodies that we fund what we want to achieve, that is, a multinational Kosovo, a coexistence in Kosovo. We need larger police forces, since existing ones are not sufficiently enough. We need independent justice - which will certainly be very difficult to set up - we also need a means of High Commissioner for Human Rights	el
So, I know this problem very well. Mr President, I would like to thank for the previous answer. I would like to ask a complementary question that has some resemblance to the one posed by Mr Sjfstedt. We are both Swedes and in our country we pay most of taxes in the form of local taxes, as the services are local and quite wide. We have a problem with confidence in politicians and this is no less true to the European politicians of this parliament. How do you think that confidence in our politicians will be affected if we have the right to use the services of the country in which we live - schools, welfare, etc. But at the same time we pay no tax, no contribution? How do you think such a system would affect the science in us politicians? It is a question, Mr Council President, which I do not know if you are obliged to answer why it is in essence philosophical. But if you want to go into the field of philosophy, you are welcome! No, Mr President, I do not feel that I am called upon to go into the field of philosophy. Here we have issues of substance, concerning the background of the regime of Members and their role within the political life of society. I would not like to go into such discussions, because I have the impression that in this way I may be pre -prior to prijuger, as the French say - the position that the Portuguese presidency will adopt in the context of negotiations on the status of MPs. Let me not make any comment on this issue. Since the time of the questions to the Council has been exhausted, questions 11 to 35 will be answered in writing. The time of the questions to the Council ended.(The meeting is interrupted at 19.05 and continues at 9pm) Speech by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic, Mr President, on behalf of the European Parliament, I would like to thank you really warmly for the very strong message you brought to us, and this is what you have. I would like to thank you: You rightly remind you that the status of a citizen of a state is fully in line with the status of a citizen of Europe. And, starting with your personal experience, you have shown us that the status of Europe is not decided, but it is a spontaneous, a natural move. I noted your words, and this is something we feel deep in us and everyone. You have once again been faithful to the principles that have always guided your action, this dedication to fundamental values. You reminded us of what you had said in 1994 and which you yourself described a bit provocative, but there are sometimes fertile utopias and together we managed to measure the path we have made. Then, I would also like to say that you have a great deal of emphasis on the role and importance of civil society, not only in the candidate countries but also in every country the European Union, to re -a sense of security to the citizens, to make them trust social solidarity.	el
"In my opinion, the proposal submitted by the Commission must contain elements that allow greater transparency of the working method of several organs, but there is certainly room for improvements at all times.We are ready to check the suggestions made in this context.The question that Jonas Sjöstedt and other MPs asked is of great importance.In Sweden there is the principle of the public that strengthens democracy and has a positive dialogue between citizens, decision -makers and authorities.We are very careful that the EU also takes this path, which is also supported by the Amsterdam contract.A few years ago, the Parliament accepted a report Lööw, which is very important in this context.It was warned that future development would lead to a restriction of the public principle in the Member States.Now we can see that this warning of parliament may have had a certain justification.I would like to ask the advice whether he can understand this warning with a view to the commission's work documents.I listened carefully to the statements of the incumbent Council President for transparency and the government conference.My question now is whether I can conclude from the really interesting comments by Mr. Seixas da Costa on the topics mentioned that the Portuguese presidency undertakes to examine the expansion of the agenda of the government conference and to enter.The problem of ""transparency"" in the working method of the institutions must not be checked only in secret or in connection with any other topics or in certain corridors - although I also know how important corridors are.This requires a special point on the agenda of the government conference, which must therefore be expanded.Mr. MP!The question of transparency is a question that is naturally connected to the organs.This government conference, at least initially, is based on the focus of the more optimal way of working of the organs, whereby in particular is invoiced that we all have, namely that the organs become more democratic, more transparent and efficient.However, all of this, while maintaining a general framework for global acceptance of all solutions that we can find in order to realize these three goals.Obviously, this question of transparency will remain on the European agenda in the long run, and apparently it will be on the agenda of this government conference.I can assure you that the Portuguese presidency will continue to confront the Member States and the representatives in the preparation group of the conference with this question.In this area, she must be able to expect the MEPs of the European Parliament, which are certainly motivated to support this proposal.Then we will check at the ministerial level how we can continue in this process.However, we have to note that we have concluded a contract of Amsterdam that was assumed in May of last year that there is a complex of measures to introduce transparency that is still implemented and the question is whether it would be premature to start a new process in the area of ​​transparency.Despite everything, I think it is a question that must always be the order of the day because there is clearly a certain awareness of the problem on the part of public opinion and because it is associated with the truly necessary responsibility of the European organs and institutions towards the citizens."	de
It would make it more attractive for producers, distributors and consumers. In particular, the proposal will increase the responsibility of the competent bodies and different interest groups responsible for the environmental labeling of the parties, as it is about setting ecological criteria. The Commission is that these goals are achieved through cooperation with the European Parliament and of the Council and the interest they have shown. In my opinion, the ratio of the EU environmental badge and national environmental brands is defined more clearly and better in the current proposal. The proposal also strengthens the position and participation of the parties. In particular, these are the environmental organs that are dealing with environmental labeling and different interest groups. They are crucial to promote and distribute the use of this voluntary tool properly. It is one of the few European tools that can indeed be used to support sustainable consumption. The Commission is of the opinion that the revision of the European Parliament has improved the regulation. Of the reviews 1, 4 and 8, which proposes the active participation of environmental organizations and consumer organizations, the Commission also believes that their support and participation are crucial in order to become balanced and credible. We may therefore accept these checks. In terms of checks 2, 3 and 7, which deals with certain aspects of coordination and cooperation with national environmental label systems, the Commission is convinced that common support measures are important, especially in order to make the EU environmental brand more well -known. Therefore, we can accept these checks. Inspection 5 proposes four ways to make the payment structure more flexible and easier for those seeking an environmental label and supports the Commission. It should be remembered that the environmental brand is voluntary and the payments must not be so high that those who invest most in the environment cannot apply for an environmental mark. The review 6 deals with the reduction of fees for SMEs and developments in developing countries and emphasizes that the deductions must be significant. The Commission may also support this review. All in all, the Commission can therefore accept all the checks. Mr President, at the end of the speech I had previously wanted to present a rules of procedure that I would like the President and the Presidium to pay attention to. Before the vote, it must be made clear that certain revision of this report has not been translated. They are only available in English. For example, these are 7 and 8 in checks. They are only in English that cannot be accepted. In order to vote for this report, these reviews must at least be read out loud before making the vote. It was the first point. The second paragraph relates, for example, to the work plan for the environmental strategy ... (the President interrupted the speaker. The units will look at this question and hope that the translations are ready by tomorrow. We cannot continue the discussion as our time is running out. Member of the Commission, thanks for your share. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered tomorrow at 12 noon. The following is a recommendation of the Committee on Blokland's drafting environment, the Public Health and Consumer Policy (A5-0056-/2000) from the joint heel of the Council to provide the European Parliament and of the Council Directive (11472/199999-C5-0274/19989 (COD). I have been reported as the second maker for the presentation of 36 and 37 of the review. I noticed it last night, and pointed it out to the main department in the morning. The Directors I admitted that there was an error in the translation service. I asked for the error to be corrected. The Director I refused to do so. From there it was said that there was no time for it. I would like to say that I can't accept this in any way. It has been more than 12 hours to change these checks. I am very sorry that the published reviews had the wrong information about who is the presenter of the presentation. So these are 36 and 37 in checks, where I am not another presenter.	fi
We have a special responsibility with regard to the promotion of economic development in this region.The admission of the talks with Syria paved the way for the convening of the multilateral coordination group in Moscow at the end of this month.I will take part in this meeting and hope that we can finally push the negotiations forward again.The European Union plays an important role in peace process, this was underlined by all sides, Palestinians, Israelis, its Arab neighbors and the USA.Our role is also not limited to that of the donor.We have to be ready to act quickly to consolidate peace in this region.But we shouldn't fool ourselves either: a comprehensive peace solution in the Middle East has its price.The Commission is already concerned with the question of how the latest encouraging developments will affect the European Union.We will soon discuss this topic with the parliament and the Council in detail.However, I would like to remind the MPs that the European Union already supports the peace process financially to the process of peace.We are the largest donors in the Palestinians.We also granted Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt.With Israel, we have intensified the cooperation in several areas that are of particular interest to the country.The contribution of the community of more than EUR 600 million in the form of grants and loans that was made between 1994 and 1998 received effective support, and the reconstruction of the dilapidated infrastructure in the West Bank and in the Gaza Strip was significantly encouraged.The Member States of the European Union together provided a further EUR 860 million in this decisive phase.In this context, I welcome the important steps that the Palestinian Authority recently initiated to improve household transparency.President Arafat will meet with the Council of Ministers next week.This meeting will offer a good opportunity to talk about the need for courageous measures to improve Palestinian administration and to strengthen the rule of law.The Commission is actively involved in these efforts.The Commission also expanded its planned support for the regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs.Last year we provided more than EUR 20 million for these projects.This package included other funds for citizens' initiatives and cross-border cooperation between Israelis and Arabs at non-regulation and expert level.The members are certainly aware that the European Union is the largest donor who supports the efforts to reconcile peoples in the Middle East.In the next phase of the peace process, there will be other potential areas for funding from the community.This includes supporting an agreement for the Golan heights, in which we can promote both security regulations as well as the mining clearance and the reconstruction of communities on the Golan heights.Economic development in Syria requires support so that the transition from a war economy to peacekeeping can succeed.The measures for reconstruction and renovation of the South Libanon, the only region in the Middle East, in which a military conflict still smolder, will also require considerable efforts.	de
"Whoever threatens, in principle, the production of this factory by demanding the reimbursement of aid granted at the time does not only threaten this steelworks but also an employer of this region on which of course depend on small and medium -sized enterprises.It goes without saying that it cannot be the competition policy of the European Union.If we want competition, we must reach this association between the needs of the national economy and the requirements of companies.It is also the only chance to develop in the underdeveloped regions of economic circuits which lead to the social protection of citizens and to the strengthening of purchasing power.In addition, we must without hesitation consider more an economic policy oriented on demand rather than on the supply alone.Mr. President, since my election to the European Parliament in 1994, I have never read a report imbued with as many anti-Irish feelings and hints as the Jonckheer report we debate today.I would like to cite the report verbatim: ""State aid per capita are the highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland, the latter country being clearly in the lead when adding national aid and aid of regional and social community"".I believe that the rapporteur simply plays with the figures.I have difficulty understanding how he can introduce social and regional funds into this mathematical equation.I would like to remind him that the European Union approved the new guidelines for regional aid for the period after 2000, which was only a simple extension of the political objectives intended to complete the internal market within Europe.Regional disparities must be overcome if we want the internal market to be a success and prosperous.I salute the fact that a help of 40 % and that an additional aid of 15 % intended for SMEs for fixed income investments will be authorized in favor of companies set up in regions eligible for objective I in Europe, after the year 2000. I remind Mr. Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies installed in Ireland must still cross two seas to reach the European market.No other Member State is disadvantaged at this point.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, the prohibition of agreements is the CUR itself of a functional legal order in Europe.The Commission considered that the practical implementation of the control of this ban was unsatisfactory: let's say that we approve.But opinions diverge as to the solution.Formally, the commission's proposal does not deviate from the prohibition of agreements but in the end, this proposal is a transition from the prohibition subject to authorization to the authorization subject to prohibition.We go from the principle of prohibition to the principle of abuse.In the company of other colleagues, I resolutely refuse a systemic change of this magnitude.I do not accept that a transposition problem can motivate in practice a modification of the legal order.We modify the law to be executable again: I find that it is unacceptable."	fr
"For all applications for the procedure, I will give the word at the end of the voting lesson.Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr. Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy on the proposal for a regulation of the Council on the implementation of measures within the framework of the approach strategy for Cyprus and Malta (KOM (1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199 (CNS)).President!I would like to Rügen the absence of the incumbent Council Presidency.I believe that with these questions from the third pillar, with these for the construction of the space of freedom, security and law so important agreements, it is intolerable that the incumbent council presidency is not here today.I would also like to talk about the problem of translations.I just want to give an example, because we don't have time, but this is a case in which the translations are very important because it is very precise legal terms.In the change of change 83 it says in Italian, the original language that ""il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legal esterno"".This ""legal esterno"" becomes an ""Avocat Neutre"" in the French version, and I don't know what an ""avocat neutre"" is.I think this is a contradiction in termis.But the lawyer disappears completely in the Spanish version, there is no longer a lawyer.Ms. President - you said it several times - that is a very serious problem.In this matter, I believe that the legal and language experts have to do a very meticulously work in order to get a reasonable version.Absolutely, Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi, that's not the first time, and it is indeed very worrying.We will deal with this problem and check all translations.Mrs. President!Before the vote, I just wanted to join Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi's opinion and say that I very much regret the absence of the Council on this debate on such important coordination of the third pillar matters.I want her to express our wish to the Council, Ms. President, that he will be present in the future with such votes.Absolutely;I know very well that the absence of the representatives of the council is not normal, and I will be happy to send it.Change application 31 Ms. President!I would like to add that in the sentence part - I will read it in French, because I have added this version to my hand - s'il est exigé par le droit de l'etat membrere Requérant que la personal donne donne son consentiment the words ""par le droit de l'entat memre requis ou requérant"".(The parliament accepts the draft of the legislative resolution.) Mrs. President!I just want to note that I forgot in the heat of the battle earlier to tell them that in my report on the deficit in the last paragraph in the Spanish version there is an error: instead of saying ""La Prupuesta nos parece correcta"", an ""s"" was forgotten, and it is called ""La Prupesta no parece corRecta"", which means exactly the opposite.It's just about correcting that.Application for decision-making (B5-0132/2000) submitted by the MP Bonino and others on behalf of the TDI parliamentary group to notify the Commission on the strategic goals for the next five years"	de
"(The session is interrupted at 11:50 p.m.) Resumption of the session The protocol of yesterday's session was distributed.Are there any objections?(Parliament approves the protocol.) Mr. President!I would like to make a comment on a session of various members of this parliament of all factions that took place last night with the participation of several vice presidents and Quästors as well as in the presence of the architects who built this plenary hall and on which the possibilities were advised on the possibilities of further improvement in our work.At this session we found that there is actually a large window behind the pretty white curtain behind her podium, Mr. President.When the curtain is opened, a wonderful view of the river should apparently be offered, but it was stated that we were explained that this curtain was closed so that they do not sit in the back light and we have a better light during the pronunciation.However, what prevents us from opening the curtain before the start of the debates or at session interruptions in order to be able to get a little in the - free - enjoyment of this supposedly wonderful view?It should be right for me if our plenary hall is enlightened by the brilliance of our pronunciation, but in my opinion it would be even better if real sunlight could illuminate our ""dome of democracy"" from time to time.It seems appropriate to me if you could check the opportunity to open the curtain from time to time with the Saaldieners.Thank you, Mr. colleague.I am grateful for every hint that makes our meeting room more human.I would like to suggest the following: We continue with the session as the room is.I now have it checked whether this is technically easy to make.If so, we do a trial operation for half an hour, what it looks like when the president sits in the back light.OGAW Mr. President, Commissioner, colleagues!I have hope that Parliament is ready today to take decisions to expand and strengthen the financial market in Europe.For me as a new MP in the EP, it was very interesting and instructive to get responsibility for this important matter.I would like to thank you especially for the willingness to compromise my colleagues in the committee, for the open -mindedness of the President and the Presidium in view of the complexity of the question, for good contacts with the Commission, in particular with the Commissioner, as well as with the council and also for the unselfish work of the secretariat of the committee.In the committee there was widespread unity, apart from a point that we hopefully will also achieve a solution.The question of certain organisms for joint systems in securities (OGAW) may seem complicated and technically and politically risky.Some, I think, don't even know what Ogaw means.However, let me state very clearly that this is a matter that really affects the citizens of Europe.It is about how your savings are managed, what options are available, how the competition between the countries works with regard to various forms of savings, what requirements the savers place on the safety and what options for a clever retirement provision that have the citizens of Europe."	de
That said, governing is planning, is also to be responsible, and in this new, imposed context, competition law naturally has an essential role to play.The Commission, in this area, has favored several axes of action: by acting on the structure of the markets by the active pursuit of anti -competitive practices, by refocusing the activity of control of its services to the only cases presenting a manifest community interest and by marking its desire to modernize the law of competition.With regard to state aid, we must ensure that the system is not increased and the introduction of a public register, in which all aid would be recorded, does not seem desirable to us, because this heavy obligation would naturally go against attempts to reduce bureaucratic constraints.Finally, with regard to the modernization of the application of articles 85 and 86 of the treaty, we do not think that a decentralized application necessarily goes in the right direction.Indeed, the Commission not only retains the power to remove a case from the jurisdiction of the national authorities, but it is clearly obliged to the national courts to avoid any conflict with the decisions of the Commission.The national states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission for the respect of the application of rules which they do not have control.In conclusion, I would say that if certain measures go in the right direction, we will naturally remain vigilant in order to avoid a federalist gear which would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the States.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, we express a globally positive judgment on the Committee's White Paper on Competition, in particular with regard to the abolition of the notification and authorization system, but we still have some doubts.Above all, there is the risk that the decentralization of skills at the level of individual states, necessary in many aspects, causes abnormal expansion of competition initiatives and encourages someone to use antitrust not as a final guarantee of the effective and foreseeable functioning of markets, but as an instrument of economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with spontaneous marketsAn instrument serving protectionist visions.In this regard, I believe that we must be inspired by the writings of Von Eieck and certainly of those of the great Italian liberal that was Bruno Leoni, who denounced the risks of an abnormal expansion of anti -competitive policies.The most serious damage to the market, the competition and the free choice of European consumers are still attributable to state interference today in the economy.We know state aid to businesses - we have talked about it - we still feel a strong state presence in the economy - it is enough to think that the Italian treasure controls 15 % of market capitalization - there are the obstacles that central governments and banks pose to merger and acquisition operations.We have often talked in recent weeks about the Vodafone-Mannesmann affair and the rescue of the Holzmann company.	fr
"Mr President, we need to set up a parliamentary committee as quickly as possible to resist these terrorist acts, because it is now important to determine how we can prevent similar conflicts anywhere: my colleague was actually recently reminded that everyone had to sweep their own door. Finally, and this feels important to me: why could we now honestly repeat something that was revealed in the UN recent report explaining that if Spain wants to maintain its labor and pension, it should not settle for 30,000 immigrants a year, but will be prepared to receive 12 million immigrants by 2050? I believe that today it is urgent to emphasize the right to education, the obligation to remember, to refer to historical dates and the moments when our countries were little to be drifting. We must be able to raise our children with this and we must have the courage to admit that in the coming years we must be prepared to receive significantly more immigrants. Good colleagues, I still urge you to participate in a demonstration on Saturday. We must be many of the streets of Europe to oppose these extremist unions that are shamed in Europe and mislead our youth. The Mr President, the European Union, has the authority of the Amsterdam Treaty to compete in combating racism and alienation. Therefore, two types of actions need to be developed: some seek to integrate citizens of non-European origin and to deal with immigration. For the former, the Commission has submitted a group of proposals to us from two Directives and one action plan to apply the following decision by the heads of government in Tampere: ""The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third -country citizens in its Member States.the rights and obligations comparable to obligations "". Mr President, this is exactly the opposite of what we have seen and learned in Ejido in recent days: numerous anti -rule, exploitation of employees, and inhumane living conditions that have already been highlighted. I hope that the integration activities will soon be implemented, and I also hope that, including the Spanish government, the governments that have been turned into Tampere in Tampere, I hope to apply them. I have little wishes for a Union policy that would be effective, fair and in the Council of the Council's declaration of immigration. The only proposal achieved is a directive for combining families, and while it is a key issue in recent days, we have seen many pictures of lonely men through the media, we do not know if the governments have already accepted it. Outside the community, some governments work to reform their immigration policies. This is the case in my home country, despite the government;Your party is the only one that the new Alien Act does not like. In accordance with the agreements, the fight against racism and anti -alienism should be the objective of all institutions and all those responsible for the Politics of the Union. On February 28, 1998, we European political parties signed a Charter anti -racism in the European political parties. It was also signed by the Spanish People's Party (Partido Popular). This obliges the party to behave consistently, but the party's local leaders throw more buns into the nest by complicating attempts at extinguishing other parties. The party, represented by the Mayor of El Ejido, should take quick and effective action in accordance with the commitments confirmed in this declaration. As Hernández Mollar said, El Ejido, and at the same time Spanish, and the whole of Europe, can reach us, at the moment, over the fact that deeply shamelessly produce, only showing uniformity, sense of responsibility, and strength. Mr President, we can only feel disgusting and condemn these real lynching strokes against Moroccan journalists. We do not know what part of racist extreme right -wing strokes and quite unconscious people have had at these events to facilitate the work of the striking groups."	fi
"The second aspect to be taken into consideration with regard to the coherence of policies is that of development policy in the context of the Union's foreign policy.We know that the Union is experiencing a new dimension of its foreign policy, we know that with the creation of the high representative, the rapid intervention force, the military management center of crises, there is a whole dynamic of affirmation of the European Union that we cannot disdain when we consider the role of development policies and also that there are aspects linked to political dialogue, the taking of positions or common actions, the preparation of common strategiesPreventive diplomacy, to the development of regional capacity for prevention and management of crises.Without doubt all these aspects will not fail to make important contributions to the strengthening of the role of development policies in the context of the European Union foreign policy, with regard to its implementation and development.Let us say that this level also, at the level of the European Union, the supervision of the development policy in the context of foreign policy will certainly have to travel the same path as that taken by the policies of development of many member states, in the context of their respective external policies.Its assertion necessarily implies a strengthening of decision -making mechanisms and institutional structures of PESC means, which allow a better articulation between the instruments of development policy and the instruments of foreign policy.In this context, our conviction is that we must go from a post-colonial paradigm to a truly European paradigm of development policy knowing, as we know, that the development policy has been strongly conditioned in the European context by the policies of certain member states, according to the post-colonial references of the policies of these states.The third aspect that must be considered is that of the European Union policy and the policy of the Member States.The coherence of policies at the European Union level certainly implies a better coordination of the policies of the Member States with the Policy of the European Union in matters of development.If it is not possible to establish better consistency mechanisms between national policies, it will certainly be difficult to reflect on a more coherent framework for European Union policy.The fourth and last aspect that I would like to submit you, always concerning development policies, relates to the role of ""development"" council.We have discussed, in particular in recent months, the role that the ""Development"" Council can have in the context of Union policies.We know that the difference in status between development policies and other policies at the Union is obvious - it is enough to see the difficult conditions in which the communitarization or the non -communitarization of the Fed has been settled - and it can be difficult to admit that we can develop more coherence in the policies of the European Union without a more active and more interventionist role of the ""Development"" Council in the political decision -making which is the caseOther advice, other decisions, which range from the ""Agriculture and Fishing"" council to that of the environment, but in relation to which the ""Development"" council has so far had no possibility of being heard or of intervening."	fr
The United Nations have a peace plan.We should seize this opportunity to end the last colonialist episode that Africa knows.I would also like to talk about the question of migration.I am concerned with the new provisions contained in the partnership agreement that we have concluded with the ACP countries, and which aim to allow more easily to repress, for less clearly established reasons, immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees.I would also really like to see the EU act as a precursor on the issue of patents relating to living organisms.We know today that every four seconds, a human being dies of hunger.Three -quarters of these victims of famine are children under the age of five.This is not due to a lack of food products, but what we have talked about a lot today, namely: increased poverty.Food security and the protection of biological diversity must pass before commercial interests.I am of the opinion that the allocation of patents relating to living organizations would be as the sole objective of controlling the supply of food products worldwide, especially for commercial purposes, and in any other purpose.I would also like to find in this report that the Commission, I hope, will submit to us, some elements on the role of women.In all contexts, and in particular in that of development policy, women seem to be completely absent - or in fact, this is not the case.Mr. President, our debate today highlights the need to discuss the development policy in terms that go much further than those which consist only in fueling the flow of aid.The level of these aids is of course important, and it should be raised for all rich countries.This is particularly necessary to fight poverty and to bet on the development of the capacities of the regions concerned.The level of aid is however only one of the many instruments which strongly influence the evolution of poor countries.A number of my colleagues have today cited areas that are important outside aid, and where contrasts and oppositions between the different sectors of politics have very serious consequences.It was in particular of commercial policy, and agricultural policy and fishing.We could obviously evoke other elements also important: the flow of private investments, cooperation in the fields of research and technology, as well as the way in which the international community deals with various global problems which concern us all, with the financing of the corresponding measures.These problems include climatic issues, that of biodiversity, public health issues, etc.This observation further increases with globalization, this new form of economy that we see spreading.The links between the different areas of politics are further strengthened.What we discuss today in this hemicycle, in my opinion, represents in part, partly the contribution of the EU to the debate on globalization, on the possibilities it offers and the risks it involves, and on the rules of the game which must be put in place so that poor countries find there real chances of development.It is naturally quite essential to study, or to summarize, as requested by Maij-Weggen, the overlaps between the different political areas and the resulting contradictions.I can only ask myself why the commission did not do it more in this regard.	fr
"However, since the situation of these points and the majority of Parliament, with the decision of the majority of Parliament, 53 and 54, that alternative partnership forms were particularly supported and thus placed before the family, we did not consider it possible to accept the entire report. Mr President, I would just like to say as a supplement to the speech of a member Pirker that I was in favor of Haarder's report 42, even though there is a mistake because Austria is mentioned in the context of free movement. On the basis of the decision of the Committee on the National Council, Austria unanimously approved the proposal to approve the decision of the Federal Government on March 26, March 2, March 2, 1996, and keep Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen's abandonments, so the passports, so alsoThere is no obstacle to preparing. Therefore, I can say in this context that both Felix Habsburg-Lothringen and Karl Ludwig Habsburg-Lothringen have a valid passport that does not include any restrictions. Neither has signed a declaration of resignation that the Constitution is required to say that they dismiss the Habsburg ruler family, but are committed to the format only in the passport application: ""In order to avoid misunderstanding, note that I, the applicant, I have not questioned the Austrian Republic.huge clothing. ""Austria's demand to do something about free movement is therefore unfounded..(FR) The European Parliament has, when accepting the Haarder's report on the Human Rights in the European Union, made one of them too normal, which is thus part of its nature. The report requests, among other things, the equality of all kinds of rights of same-sex couples and traditional families and the reduction of homosexual relationships to the legal age limit. I would just like to remind me that, according to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (Article 16), ""Family is a natural and fundamental core of society and is entitled to the protection of society and the state.""The family is defined in the same article as a marriage between a man and a woman. The International Agreement on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights repeats the same idea by proclaiming in Article 10: ""Family that is a natural and fundamental society of society must be protected and supported as widely as possible.""Although the traditional family has the right to support public authority, this is due to the fact that it guarantees a service that does not have a price: generational renewal, continuation of society, child education and values. This service widespread that the family has special privileges that are reserved for it only. The Harder's report ignores this essential law and demonstrates how, in this paragraph, in this paragraph, the European mechanisms are not only against the peoples but the society itself..(DA) We support the general observations that are presented in a report on Member States dealing with the completion of international human rights agreements. We also agree with the concerns mentioned in the report regarding the situations of asylum seekers, minorities, women, children, and so on in certain states. However, we oppose the aim of increasing the integration of the EU through an annual report on human rights. We do not support the institutional reforms presented in the report, including the fact that the EU should draw up a common legal framework and a common refugee and asylum policy. In our opinion, human rights problems need to be addressed at the local level and in international human rights bodies and in human rights forums that already exist and have been established for that purpose, such as the UN and the Council of Europe. Nor do we support the EU to draw up a new legally binding book of fundamental rights, as such a fundamental rights book is in conflict with the European Convention on Human Rights. The EU's fundamental rights book itself does not improve the situation of the people, neither at European or international level. However, we are in favor of this report, despite the above, because we believe it is very important to fight for the human rights situation in Europe."	fi
"The environmental problems of Europe can never be solved by you alone.Finally, for those who still have doubts for economic reasons: only think about how high the otherwise incurred costs for cleaning our sea would be!There will be the time when we face such requirements.Then we will be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent the initiation of oil.President!First of all, I would like to express that nobody doubts the need for a guideline about this problem.It is a serious problem not only for Europe, but for all world oceans, and therefore effective and urgent measures are required.I would like to make it clear that there are a number of universal principles with which we consequently fully match.First, all ports must have the necessary systems for waste treatment.Second, of course, the cause principle applies.I admit that there can be disagreements in the exceptions with regard to ship types and sizes.However, one cannot start a battle that leads to a distortion of competition between the different ports and presents us with the situation that a number of theoretically environmentally political measures to protect the coast or the sea ultimately cause a distortion of the competition between the different ports.Therefore, effective measures must be taken at this point, because if we do not find a suitable solution, this guideline will end up with an absolute failure.It will only bring advantages for some ports to the disadvantage of others, and all of this due to beautiful words about the environment, but they cover a competition between the ports.Logical would be, for example, the definition of the principle of a unit tariff for all ports in Europe, an absolutely the same tariff that would not cause or would have a distortion of competition.Any decision that allows subsidies on the part of the states for the various ports would distort the competition and ultimately be ineffective.President!I share the love of the sea and diving as well as for sailing, and I am convinced that everyone present is about how we will be able to ensure clean seas for today's and future generations.I think the work discussed here today is a big step forward.In this sense, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. Bouwman, and the entire committee for regional policy, transport and tourism for the meticulous work, which you have done in the course of the debate and in the entire processing of this initiative.As you know, sea pollution fulfills the Commission with very great concern.At the next opportunity, I hope to be able to send you a first package of measures for better control of security on oil tankers, measures that, as I hope, we can bring all together under the impression of the dramatic shipwreck of the ""Erika"";This dramatic circumstance may cause that this time we are able to go beyond certain, very specific interests that are undoubtedly affected by the measures that I will propose in the near future.But even if the accident is the cause of major problems and great disasters, it is a fact that most introductions do not come from accidents, but simply from the habitual, completely ruthless cleaning of the keel rooms through some ships."	de
The stability, safety and peace of the Maghreb region will depend on the organization of this referendum. In order for a referendum to facilitate the achievement of these goals, it is important to ensure that the preparatory work is properly carried out, and in particular, to properly prepare a complete list of voters, and it is also important to emphasize the literal criteria for the list. It is important not only for this area, but also to Europe as a whole, and especially to certain states that the European Union takes full responsibility for its task as a mediator of this process. It must carry out this task, inter alia, by supporting the decisions of the United Nations and by ensuring that this process is completed completely openly, completely certainly and absolutely clean democracy. Mr President, after East Timor, the process aimed at Self-determination in Western Sahara is the last one that is still without a solution. In addition, in this process aimed at self-determination, the situation becomes more difficult day by day, as last week has been stated in the news of the oppressed regions of Western Sahara. The proper implementation of this self-determination process depends on peace and economic integration and development in all Maghreb countries. I would add that it also depends on the transition to complete democracy, which seems to be about to begin in the Moroccan Kingdom. From our point of view, the implementation of the process of self-determination in Western Sahara requires the implementation of the peace plan of the United Nations and also the African Unity Organization. The central idea of ​​this plan is to provide a referendum on self -determination, which is fair, free, and where voters can express their views without any pressure. In spite of the efforts of the United Nations, despite the Minurso, despite the progress of the list of voters, the referendum has still been postponed for an almost vague time. The postponement of the vote is certainly mainly the responsibility of one party who has not approved the terms and conditions of the vote. In order for this vote to be made in order to make the self-determination of Western Sahara's self-determination as soon as possible, we need to utilize the tools that we have at our disposal: firstly, Houston's contracts and secondly James Baker's operations. A direct dialogue between the parties is also essential. The Kingdom of Morocco and the Polisario front must revive the direct dialogue that took place in the late 1980s and also led to the contracts in Houston. The Union must primarily try to cooperate in favor of not brake this process and to be happily completed. Unfortunately, the Union has not worked in the best possible way. Several statements have been made, but in practice little has been made. The most important thing in this resolution we accept today is the request of the Parliament to the Council that this would accept joint activities of Western Sahara, as states in the European Union. This means statements and tools, we need to take advantage of all of our equipment available and work together to be happily completed, help James Baker, support the United Nations, request the terms of international resolution. In this way, we can contribute to reaching the main goal: peace in the Maghreb countries. Länsi-Sahara's self-determination is essential for it. Mr President, on behalf of my group, I would like to express to the European Parliament, but above all, the Commission and the Council for our great concerns about the current situation in Western Sahara. The continuous postponement of the referendum on the future of Western Sahara is not accepted. There is a state of emergency in occupied areas. At least 56 people, of whom 27 women, were arrested because they had spoken for their sovereignty. We invoke the Moroccan government to suspend revenge, cancel the state of emergency, and allow free expression of opinion. We require the Council of the European Union to accept joint measures that allow for the implementation of the peace plan without delay and properly. The efforts of the UN Secretary -General Special Ambassador, James Baker, so far, should be utilized in future mediation to implement the UN Security Council resolution 1292 (2000).	fi
"However, if we alone make a diagnosis of the incohernations of our politics, we will be completely frustrated, and the diagnosis will also be negative.As with the strength systems in classical physics, it makes no sense to start politics that inhibit each other.The result of this absurd game is not zero, but would be a negative value that is made up of material, financial and human resources that would be wasted in a useless effort.A negative value that multiplies in politics by the number of results that are not always achieved if a measure canceled the effects intended by another measure.In today's globalized world, this truth comes to light even more.There are also no limits for community policies.Therefore, I am pleased that the Commission and the Council have rediscovered their interest in the coherence of the community policies and that they, together with the complementarity between national politics and community policy and the coordination between the service of the Commission, intend to shape the policy of the development cooperation of the European Union.Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency include the will to integrate coherence into the political, which have a very important impact on developing countries, but without listening to concrete measures in which this coherence is reflected.Both institutions call the large areas in which this concept is to be used.In its long -term orientations, for example, the Commission says that the goal of sustainable development in strong solidarity, based on a trade policy that takes into account the common interests, must be expressed.The Commission refers to a very important area, to trade policy.In parliament, we want to add the policies of development aids to agriculture, fishing, migrations, the position in international financial institutions, foreign policy and joint security as well as the structural adjustment aids.The Council - said Mr. Luis Amado this morning - has spoken out several times about the necessity of coherence - most recently only in November 1999, but also on other occasions, such as ""Development"" from May 1999 and June 1997, but without any concrete results.We agree with what the ""Development"" Council designed - which is very important - and can say little, as someone mentioned beforehand in his contribution.As Parliament, on the other hand, we would like to - as was also said and is required in the resolution - to form the formation of a cross -management working group, to which those responsible for all politics mentioned, suggest the establishment of an observation center of the coherence of the various community policies, which is able to predict the effects of each policy in developing countries and with each other.But the fact is that we want to be realists, and we do not miss the persecution of these goals of coordination, complementary and the most complicated about which we are talking about, the coherence, a more sophisticated policy than we currently have in the European Union.We hope - and we do it - that the wind of the change that the government conference, the reform of the Commission - will also affect development services - will bring us this new election period and the perspectives of the expansion in order to further perfect a more coherent political union."	de
I was delighted to learn, last week, that, in recent years, the Commission pays sustained attention to the concept of subsidiarity and that it refers to it in relations, not only between the Union and the Member States, but also between the Union, the Member States, the Regions and the Cities.I hope that Commissioner Barnier, continuing dialogue in the Europe regions, will develop this idea and learn from what he hears.Mr. Commissioner, I refer to one of your answers to the previous questions where you mention what I call the possibilities of locking the treaty in the face of the risks of deviance, and in particular the diversification of sanctions which can strike a Member State, in application of article 7, for violation of fundamental freedoms.Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this nature, can be part of the mandate of the CIG as it was defined in Helsinki?For my part, I do not have the impression.Do you not fear that such sanctions can slip and serve to punish, not human rights violations, but simple divergences, crimes of opinion or differences in relation to European dominant thought?Yes, Mr. Bonde, we will start this debate with 700 young people in Brussels.It turns out that they will work in the institutions and with the Commission and I think it is a good start for this dialogue with young people who are motivated.Regarding social protection, I confirm that we have made proposals on the scope of the qualified majority or the field of unanimity, without ideology.In your country, Mr. Bonde, as everywhere, I believe that we are attached to the proper functioning of the internal market, to the fairest conditions of competition and traffic for goods and people.And so that's what is our rule.We propose to decide by qualified majority of certain policies or certain measures in tax matters or in terms of social protection, social security, when there is a direct link with the proper functioning of the internal market.Our proposal is not general, it is not systematic.I know the sensitivity of these tax and social protection subjects well.I do not think that all national social protection systems should be put in the same mold, there has never been a question of this, but simply to ensure, in Europe to thirty or twenty-seven countries, the best operating conditions of the domestic market without a state can block the 26 or 27 others.Mr. MPCORMICK, yes, I confirm that this dialogue must go beyond national capitals, that he must go as close as possible to people, where they live, where they have roots, and if I told you something else, I would not be in agreement with myself, as a commissioner in charge of regional policy, that is to say, one of the most concrete, most visible,To the quality of life of people in their region, and you will often hear me that this policy is not only made for the priority objective of cohesion and solidarity between regions, it is also made in addition so that people, where they live, can keep their roots, their traditions, their soul, their identity.	fr
The two presidents rightly did not insert this subject into their file.Everything must remain in its place and have its own priorities.In my opinion, the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission were right to look at the most delicate points in the peace process which, as we know, still encounters a lot of difficulties.We absolutely have to support this peace process and the attention we pay to the phenomena denounced in the question of Ms. Morgantini, does not contain prejudices against one or the other of the parties.It reflects our friendly severity, our severity vis-à-vis the friend's friend of Israel so that these illegalities and irregularities are no longer reproduced because they are everyone.From this point of view too, this initiative must be seen as a positive fact, as an initiative that wants to encourage the peace process in the Middle East.Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, the trade agreement in force between Israel and the European Community is indeed quite confused.It is also extremely difficult to determine the origin of the products in question.So I also think that it is desirable to quickly clarify this problem.However, we must take into account a whole series of other essential factors.We all agree that the recent resumption of peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered.For the moment, the Israelis and the Palestinians are negotiating their future borders intensively.Any attempt emanating from anyone, any third party, and intended to define, even impose, the territorial scope is therefore premature.In my opinion, it is preferable to wait for the result of the trilateral working group relating to the rules of origin which will be set up on the initiative of Israel, the European Commission and the Palestinians.I am delighted that the commissioner shares this opinion.Hopefully this working group will find a provisional solution to the problem in the existing legal framework, without jeopardizing the peace process, because this process must be considered as an absolute priority, especially by the European Community, and Europe cannot put sticks in the wheels.There is, it seems, a remarkable consensus today within the Assembly, but I would like to make some comments.Here in Parliament, trade in the Middle East has always been an extremely sensitive political point.We are important donors but we are unfortunately excluded in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively, as many stakeholders have reported it today, exactly as we did in the case of Northern Ireland.We are important consumers of the products of Israel and the occupied territories, trade being probably our main political force in the region and our encouragement to promote the rule of law is our main asset in our effort to contain the peace agreement.The borders are being closed, sometimes arbitrary, sometimes following a terrorist attack.	fr
"The way Ireland, like other countries, handles the situation at this point, is unsatisfactory, but we hope that these pressures will be able to work. I want to point out once again that the content of this letter is still valid. It is not possible in accordance with the Regulation. You have to speak out of the room now, a lady MP. Questions to Mr. Barnier Question No.44 of K. (H-720/00): Subject: Corporate Relationship and GSF in Greece The new Regulation 1260/1999 on Structural Funds gives, against the preceding regulation, emphasis on the strengthening of the corporate relationship and provides for the participation of regional and local authorities and other public authorities and other public authoritiesPreparation as well as funding, monitoring and evaluation of interventions. But for the new Greek CSF, according to repeated complaints of local government bodies, the procedures have remained the same and not at all substantial about the role of the ""partners"". Has there been a change in the procedures on behalf of the Greek state to expand the synthesis of the corporate relationship mainly to local authorities and other representative bodies? What is the increased role of the local authorities in the preparation and management of the GDP and what measures the Commission will take to ensure the greater participation of the ""partners"" in all the new CSF processes? Let me fill in with a phrase the answer that Margot Wallstrfm has just given to President David Martin. I would like to tell him, since it was a joint letter from our two predecessors, that as a successor to Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I think this letter is still in place and that I am trying with Margot Wallstrfm, with whom we have a consent of views, to control the compatibility with the environmental guidelines and policies. You are also answered by Mr President Martin, a former Minister of Environment. I would now like to say a few words to Mr Alavanos, from whom I apologize for this brief reference to another matter, to answer him that the Commission was actually vigilant and will be vigilant, in the context of preparing the new planning period, for the implementation of the company. Let me remind me, though you know, that the participation of regional and local authorities in the action of the community is one of the key elements of the new structural fund regulation after the Berlin European Council. Specifically, with regard to the implementation of this corporate relationship in the context of the new Community Support Framework for Greece, the Commission found that the public authorities greatly contributed to the preparation of the Greek Regional Development Program for the period 2000-2006. I also visited the country twice, as Mr Alavanos knows, under very difficult circumstances, extending the dramatic experience of the earthquake, and on the occasion of these visits I was able to talk to the Greek government authorities, reminding this concern that the concern is clearly taken into account. Regarding, Mr. MP, the subsequent phases, namely the training of national and regional programs, is not enough for this goal to be taken into account at national and theoretical level, rather than needed to be specifically reflected in the CSF programs at national, regional and local level."	el
As the rapporteur states, in addition, the results of the structural measures for employment were limited. For this reason we should be somewhat cautious when referring to the effectiveness of Community support. Serious question marks also arise that, in some cases, the differences between regions in the Member States are increasing. Mr President, for this reason, I have the impression that it would be appropriate and necessary, especially in terms of promotion of employment, to draw our attention to the national and regional authorities, who know better than anyone else the regions that fall within their jurisdiction. If these authorities are allowed to draw up specific plans for these regions and by granting financial aid, if necessary, a better result can be achieved. Let's not forget that this is our ultimate goal. For this reason, I fully agree with the idea of ​​leaving the Commission to practice and implement the measures in Member States and regions. In relation to this, it may be preferable to give more importance to Member States in terms of financial support. By expanding the criteria from regions to Member States we will prevent many future problems. Finally, I would like to draw attention to the place of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. The report shows that, in general, in these countries there is a long delay compared to the countries of the European Union, especially with regard to the per capita GDP. With the predicted accession, in a short time, many of these countries are absolutely necessary to revise the current structural policy. Following other members of the House, I would like to call the Commission to submit any proposals for the reform of the sector soon. Dear Mr President, Honorable Associates, Mr. Commissioner, after a meticulous study of the present report, one undoubtedly concludes that the predetermined goal of structural policy was only able to be achieved in part. Thus, among other things, the inequality that exists between the regions has probably increased, but the Member States themselves have a relevant approach here. Also, the numbers of the unemployed in the most affected regions were almost unable to reduce at all, even in part. So I wonder what is the fact that structural resources were not more effectively used. Even the cumulation of resources by the Cohesion Fund and the Structural Funds did not bring about the desired success in all regions and in all countries. Since the proclaimed aim of all policies at European level is to reduce unemployment, the crucial question must be raised whether the policy is implemented or whether it is more intended to enhance the competitiveness of the regions by taking appropriate measures, such as increased promotion of research and growth, improving infrastructure and infrastructure. Serious structural reforms and the competition favorable to tax policy are the components of a successful economic activity. If we do not intend to tolerate the accusation that we are pursuing a structural policy with cost intensity that moves nothing to the issue of employment in a sustainable manner, then the measures have to be examined in detail.	el
"That is not so clear in the German text.I would like to ask that this will be checked again.Otherwise I would like to thank our rapporteur very much.This is a difficult matter, and I hope that we have brought it to it so that we can better deal with it now.Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report.I would like to add that the conciliatory attitude of Ms. Frassoni is a welcomed change as her willingness to make compromises with the other institutions.As for the government conference, Ms. Frassoni represents those who call the French ""Les Pures et Dures"": no compromises, no negotiations with the other institutions, we prefer to block the entire conference rather than deviate from our positions.Nevertheless, Ms. Frassoni is ready to accept the progress that has not been achieved with the original position of Parliament on the question of comitology.I would like to remind you of what is at stake here.The parliament essentially criticized four points of the committee, as was the case before the new decision of the Council and the addition by this interinstitutional agreement.First, the entire system is opaque.It is not transparent, hundreds of committee meetings take place, the agendas are not known, and nobody knows who is sitting in the committees.Here the agreed new system will make a real improvement.We will find out who is represented in the respective committees.We will be informed when the meetings will take place.We will receive the agendas.We will receive the documents that are distributed to the committee members.The whole system will become more open and transparent despite its still complicated nature.So this is at least progress.Our second criticism is that the system has severely restricted the Commission.We say goodbye to the legal act of the European Union, the Commission has the task of implementing it, and then there is a system that hinders the commission and makes it difficult to implement - here in particular the so -called ""contra -fillet"" procedure is to be mentioned, according to which the Council was able to block the Commission even with a simple majority if it himself was not able to show an alternative to the relevant implementation measure.Here too, progress has finally been made.The Council can no longer block implementation measures after the three -month period if there is no qualified majority, i.e. in other words, if a large part of the Member States represented in the Council does not refuse this measure.This is a more sensible system.This is also to be seen as progress.As for our other two criticisms, however, we are less satisfied.On the one hand, we criticize the system that the Commission only monitors, checked or checked, checked, and if they will be controlled by the member states or the Council, and does not take control of the parliament.The legislative, the council and the parliament should be equal.We transfer the commission implementation powers, and then it is only a committee appointed by the council or the Member States that acts as a referee and stop the commission and stop a implementation measure.Parliament does not have powers of the same rank.Such powers should now be transferred to us in the new system."	de
Then we have an elastic paragraph on the effectiveness of the negotiations and institutions, which can be used to achieve any feasibility, so ... (the President interrupts the speaker) Mr President, colleagues, after the Portuguese Presidentperceptions. We, as a European Parliament, will take advantage of these opportunities to promote the issues that concern us in the corresponding way. The Commission's preparations are going on in a right direction to date, although they do not go far enough in relation to the resolutions of the European Parliament. But there will be a reason later. It will be decisive for the intergovernmental conference to achieve three things at the same time: the ability to action, democratic legitimacy and transparency. Only if these three things are data will be followed by the acceptance by citizens. The ability to act, of course, must be achieved in order to launch the European Union's ability to enlarge. And a major reference to this request is the discussion we had previously had in the body. We must be capable of action if there may be a government that will be blocked. It is therefore an important reference to the fact that decision -making based on the majority principle is a critical prerequisite for the European Union to operate in any case. This is important especially in terms of enlargement, in the field of legislation, in the area of ​​contracts that entail amendments to the legislation. At this point, of course, we want to extend the corresponding rights of the European Parliament. In this case, we should act as a European Parliament in the field of Economic and Monetary Union as the audit is not sufficient in the area. The finance ministers behave at the Ecofin Council, the European Council of 11 as if it were their own only intergovernmental event, which is unacceptable. Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favor of expanding the control of the European Central Bank, I am in favor of her independence. From the political point of view, however, the audit must be guaranteed respectively. The Triangle Committee, Council and Parliament should also be set up in the field of foreign policy and security policy. In this area, the Council has so far had almost the monopoly, and especially in terms of primitive crisis management measures, for which the Commission is solely responsible. All of this has not been adequately integrated into this overall approach. We must re -examine whether various changes in the context of the intergovernmental conference are necessary in this case. The Portuguese presidency said it would weigh the situation so that there may be an expansion of the mandate. I want to point out another important point. The discussions we have been holding in recent days e.g. For a state of a state in Europe, they show that we must determine the spiritual and moral direction of the European Union which is geared towards the rule of law and the good of the community and the whole. They also show that for this reason they will have to join the Treaty legally binding fundamental rights, as this will be a critical stabilizing factor.	el
Water as a human right that should be available free of charge - that sounds very good, but water is not free, just as little as apartments or food.We can only achieve better handling of water and greater economy with effective tax instruments.I would also like to add that I support a tighter schedule as well as a clarification of goals and exceptional criteria for groundwater and human activities, as well as the express naming of radioactive substances.In the course of the pronunciation, several speakers have referred to the importance of information for the public and consultations with the citizens.I can only underline that once.The involvement of the public through good information and a concerting process is decisive for our success, which is also considered in consideration 14.Mr. Bowe should be said that both he and my Scottish employee can continue to approve a glass of scotch whiskey from time to time with a clear conscience!We have received the assessment from the Commission that no regulations are necessary for the extremely low water withdrawal for whiskey production.Now let me comment some areas a little more detailed.Limiting the introduction of pollutants into our waters must be one of the most important goals.I am pleased that Parliament's amendments have concentrated on it.The Commission supports the application for inclusion of the OSPAR regulations in the text.However, we have to stick to their exact content and area of ​​activity.As I said, the goal and the schedule for Ospar are primarily political obligations. A legally binding schedule would not be in accordance with it.Nevertheless, it must be ensured that the Member States and the community are forced to take measures with the help of which the goals set are achieved and the schedules are observed.For these reasons, I welcome the amendments 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88. In contrast, the Commission cannot agree to the change application 19, the definition of the dangerous substances of which deviates from that in OSPAR.The Commission's proposal contains a clear procedure for selecting these substances, which makes an additional definition superfluous.Even if I agree with the content of the change applications 79 and 106, they go beyond the OSPARTIONS and therefore cannot be accepted.In principle, the Commission can also apply for a change application, in which a schedule for the Commission's proposal with regard to the issuing of substances of substances in the priority list is requested.Amendment 59 contains the demand for continuous examination of the priority list.However, this would lead to legal uncertainty regarding the status of this list and therefore cannot be accepted.The request for a guideline list expressed in a change application 60 and 93 and a list of those substances that are only insufficiently available can not be met.Such lists would have an unclear legal status and would not be compatible with the procedure to accept the list of priority.In this context, I would like to emphasize that the OSPAR convention in no way changes the existing community law regarding nitrate emission from agriculture.This framework guideline will therefore have no influence on the Nitrat Directive.	de
In Ireland, some services are a foreign company, for example, English companies operate there at least. However, this Directive has never been part of national legislation. The Commission's mission is to ensure that national governments act as required by legal obligations and that they change their legislation to the objectives of the Directives. This has not been done in Ireland, where the liberalization of services has occurred to some extent without preventing the government. A small part of our market is in the possession of private actors. But common rules are needed, for example, in the Netherlands, the liberation of the sector has been made, while not in Germany, and now German companies, protected by national law, are trying to enter the Dutch market. This is another example of how important it would be to create common rules and ensure their implementation throughout the Union. I myself come from the countryside. I am in favor of the principle of liberation and the right of everyone in the competition and I know what benefits common rules and the liberation of services have brought over over the years. For example, they have made the journey from the outskirts of the European Union to Central Europe only a small part of the cost of 20 years ago. I remember the time when Parliament lobied in the name of the national interest against the release of this field. However, we allow it, and now young people can travel and expand their education. Our elderly people can also enjoy the benefits of traveling, even though they live on social security. In this way, the liberation of the industry has eliminated weight from our shoulders on many things and allowed many to enjoy a higher quality of life. On the other hand, there are also limits in the open market. In the countryside, it is understood that not all services can be offered and will not be offered in the open market. Thus, when the Commission, when making new proposals, they must be remembered for those sparsely housed rural areas by making legislation so that it does not deprive rural areas of access to all services. In the Irish countryside, even before the Irish free state was formed, we sometimes had post office services. Today, in many rural areas, postal services are probably the only form of public service, and now we are concerned about whether Union legislation takes the opportunity to maintain this. I would like to emphasize that current legislation protects rather than threatening every citizen's right to this service in rural areas. But some individuals have complained that social subsidies are paid in post offices in Ireland. I want the Commission to understand that this is a necessary social service. We must achieve the purpose of the Directive, that is, guarantee the availability of postal services to everyone. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good colleagues, in addition to the undeniably important role of postal services for employment, they are a great help when trying to achieve the much needed cohesion, the basic cause of the existence of the European Union. As is known, the Commission should have submitted new proposals before the end of 1998 to reform the Postal Directive 97/67/EC to ensure comprehensive provision of services, ensure the financial profitability of the mail services, gradually released the mail service market and assess the consequences. For this purpose, the Commission has commissioned the costs of the services covered by research, the effects of releasing foreign mail and direct mail mail, the effects of reducing the printing and price limits of closed sector, other stages except for distribution of distribution, the postal procedure and the overall assessment of the research results. Mr President, so we wonder and ask a valuable member of the Commission - a member of the Commission Bolkeste is not there, but a member of the Commission is a multi -talented person, and I believe that he or she has an opinion that these studies should not look at the economic and social impact of different liberation scenarios in every member of the European Union, eachOf course, postal services are quite different in Greece or in the UK than in the Netherlands or Belgium. How to release competition can guarantee funding and functionality of comprehensive postal services, for example in a country as in my home country Greece, taking into account the specific features of its surface formation and many small but populated islands.	fi
They grow, but in terms of GDP.Their competitiveness increases, but the growing wealth does not reach everyone because the number of jobs does not increase and the difference in employment opportunities in the individual regions continues.Mr. Commissioner, read the statement of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, and give you priority, because this is the big problem of the citizens.And take into account the requirements for employment when checking, assigning the reserves, because this is ultimately what the structure and cohesion funds require.Mr. President, the guidelines must be designed in such a way that they make the programs of the important five years from 2002 to 2006 sensibly and strengthen their efficiency so that goals such as sustainable development and employment promotion, especially for women and adolescents, are finally reality and the balance between economic and social and environmental policy remains.It is particularly important to cope with the growing problems in cities, the security of employment in rural areas, the promotion of agricultural regions and of course - as provided for in Article 158 of the contract - the granting of the same development opportunities for the islands of the European Union, of course also for the Greek, which make up half of the islands of the Union.The cohesion policy must be further strengthened, because a Europe with a considerable gradient in the level of life between the individual regions is neither credible nor can it exist.President, ladies and gentlemen!I have attentively and listened to her explanations, your job methods and her suggestions in connection with the report by Ms. Schroedter.We all, wife of rapporteurs, ladies and gentlemen, know the reasons, the appointments, the delays - I come to speak right away.But today we are discussing the report that is available for me and the Commission at the right time, since it is about the guidelines 2000-2006 and we are currently starting with the new regional program planning phase.Ms. Schroedter, you rightly reminded that it is essentially the task of the Member States and the regions to determine your own development priorities.However, due to the co -financing of the programs by the European Union, it is necessary and correct that community priorities are also taken into account, as they are discussed and adopted here in order to promote this community dimension of economic and social cohesion, which many of them have reminded of them.Therefore, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly respond to the importance and structure of the guidelines before I have spoken of the comments or the criticism that you, Ms. Schroedter, or you, ladies and gentlemen, have to speak.With regard to the importance and structure of the guidelines, the committee chairman Hatzidaki, the rapporteur and Ms. McCarthy reminded that the guidelines have the purpose of supporting the national and regional bodies in preparing their programming strategy for targets 1, 2 and 3 of the structural funds and their connections to the cohesion fund.The aim is to present the priorities of the Commission, which are based on the experience in the implementation of the programs, as well as the current community policies in connection with the structural measures.	de
"I'm happy about this. In fact, I have always considered it completely unfair practice that the launch of negotiations with Cyprus would be a prerequisite for solving a situation where Turkey occupies a third part of the land of this Republic. In general, it is true that the socio-economic situation of these two countries is much more favorable than that of other candidates. However, the European Union has granted them technical and financial assistance, which has been conditional on the transfer of the Community Code to their legislation. Until the end of 1999, this technical and financial assistance was granted in the Fourth Funding Protocol (B7-4011). These two countries can also receive financial assistance from the Meda program (B7-4012). The European Parliament has emphasized in its first and second discussions in 2000 that the new chapter ""preparation"" (B7-0) proposed by the Commission's preliminary budget proposal should not be restricted to central and Eastern European associated countries, but should also extend to Malt and Cyprus. However, since the Council has refused to negotiate the necessary revision of the necessary revision of the financial views provided for in Fragrance 7 (preparation), the European Parliament has exceptionally approved this, in particular, I emphasize this issue, the decline 4 (external functions) for the financing of these 2000 expenditure expenditure. At the same time, the European Parliament has created a new song ""Strategy preparing the Mediterranean countries"" (B7-04). Inside this song, two new articles on Malta and Cypriot -preparatory strategy have been created for the duration of the Commission to propose - as a result of the work of the European Council of Helsinki - the necessary legal criteria and the 7 upper limit for the Findings of the Funding Views. This proposal for this regulation should be one of these legal criteria!.(EN) I have a positive attitude towards Brok report that supports the Commission's proposals to produce Cyprus and Malta for EU membership. The package will grant a total of approximately EUR 15 million to these two countries this year. Unfortunately, however, the Commission has wandered out on perennial funding and, on the other hand, decided to grant funds on an annual principle. This will certainly affect the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan the use of funds. These two islands are supported technically and economically to meet the requirements of the Community Code. As they are already advanced to other applicant states, they should not have any difficulty in ""technically and administratively"" ready for membership at the end of the five -year program. Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000).(FR) As a member of the Committee on Financial and Monetary Affairs, I am pleased with the acceptance of this framework decision, which aims to enhance our uniform currency. The Union must introduce all the means available to protect the uniform currency from counterfeiting. In fact, consumers and merchants do not know the euro well yet. Thus, it is quite easy to lower the counterfeit money in department stores, money exchange offices and banks without immediately being noticed. For coins, the fact that their other side can be national will make them even more difficult to identify. European information agencies who already play an essential role in communicating with citizens in communicating with uniform currency to enhance campaigns aimed at paying the public's attention to the counterfeit of money. At the second level, cooperation between community institutions and national institutions must be guaranteed and create a information system that enables the collection and exchange of information about money counterfeiting. In the case of criminal law, it is also necessary to take measures that guarantee the euro protection right from the start. In this frame, the European Parliament has proposed a proposal as a framework decision in order to strengthen criminal law protection to prevent consecutive financial counterfeiting. The purpose of the Framework decision is to supplement the Convention on the punishment of 20 April 1929 and facilitates the action of Member States to apply it. Each Member State shall take the necessary measures to punish the violations referred to in the framework decision. These violations are also punishable if they apply to future bank vouchers and coins marked in the euro and the violations have been made before 1 January 2002."	fi
I don't know if he is there to hear me. What is left of the human rights, which is one of the most important parties in the Flemish area, if the Belgian Parliament approves the incredible, inappropriate and shameful bill in the Belgian Main Political Main Opponent tomorrow to dismantle? What is left of the right to study our history critically when writers and publishers are persecuted, as yesterday's hometown Lyon's Court of Appeal, when the persecution of Jean Plant, a young historian, to which general prosecutor Jean-Olivier Viout focused on insane, brazen and shameful demands? The case is an indication of one -way thinking and intellectual sympathy. It is a strange understanding of human rights if a cheaply treated patriotism is treated with war -war nationalism and the right to oppose immigration policy to any anti -alienity and the essential defense of identity to racism! Where are the human rights of the millions of French voters on the national front, when they have been taken to political representation, when they are being praised daily, again on Monday, on state TV channels, which they have to maintain in their taxes, when a colleague of one of our colleagues, Jean-Marie Le Pen's rightly frustrated expression, is used by the lawsuit. Equality and morality, and when at the moment, the aim is to take the most obvious texts for granted the act of two million voters, which he has received on the basis of their votes and not by the popularity of the ruling parties. Dear colleagues, in short, believe in your speeches of the human rights of Europe only when you give your political opponents the same rights you grant yourself. I believe in your speeches of China's human rights when you name the true evil, the communism. Listen to the voice of the Great Solzhenitsyn in his letter to American, which is said that the greatest cause of weakness in Western societies is the over -emphasis of legal individualism, for this kind of individualism does not allow for the best of man's best, but prepares the way for the future dictatorship. Mr President, the principle of global human rights, is undoubtedly one of the most important inherits of 20th century politics. Holocaust 50 years ago was the reason why certain fundamental rights and freedoms were decided. Since the end of the Cold War, compliance with human rights has also become a prerequisite for international cooperation. Leaders who violate these principles are now being subjected to international criticism and sanctions, and even in court, which former dictators, such as Pinochets, have experienced. This kind of development is hopeful. However, it does not eliminate the fact that the human rights situation in the world is still very worrying. Especially in war situations, citizens are increasingly saving. This seems contradictory. Never before in history the humanitarian rights have never evolved. There have never been so many international agreements ratified by so many countries. However, the most important rules of behavior are violated, and the number of civilian casualties is more than a century ago. Women are systematically raped. Children are forced to become soldiers and sent to battle. Abuse is no longer an exception, but unfortunately they have become a rule. This now applies to at least 30 conflicts in the world. The human rights policy of the international community could be described as follows: Too late, too selective and too fragmented. It's too late. Despite many warnings in both Rwanda and Kosovo, the UN has seemed to have remained a powerless by -side viewer of massacre, as President Havel said here this afternoon. However, 50 years later, we will not be able to avoid genocide. Therefore, more attention must be paid to monitoring and conflict prevention. In this context, the management of the arms trade and the better control of the media are essential. Human rights policy is also too selective. Monthly NATO bombing in Kosovo and brokerage attempts in the Middle East are in a sharp contradiction with how indifferent to the international attitude towards African conflicts.	fi
This type of parallel enlargement to Southeast Europe, which is represented by the agreements we are currently discussing, is therefore required to be decisively pursued. In this very spirit, almost provocatively, we have presented an amendment aimed at proposing the transfer of responsibilities for Southeast Europe from external cases to enlargement. The most rapid and immediate involvement of Southeast Europe in the lives of European institutions has also led us to propose to accept a limited number of observers, envisaged by national parliaments in the European Parliament, and staff from these countries to be able to work in the court and the Commission. To encourage, however, the evolution of the region to a more democratic society that will be maximized on the market economy, we mainly believe that there must be immediate and specific steps to intensify the anti -corruption struggle and make international aids more effective. For this reason, we have presented some amendments, which I hope that Parliament will want to accept: First, to offer the former Republic of Macedonia a zero tariff for its exports to the European Union and a compensation for the progressive decline of customs duties. Borders of Macedonia. Secondly, to encourage the former Republic of Macedonia, with an appropriate financial support, to gradually link its currency in the euro as a first step towards a Europeanization of the entire Macedonian economy, and with the ultimate goal of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system. Third, the support and support that the world must offer to the region, and therefore in Macedonia, to have a clearly multilateral nature, without imposing the beneficiary country on the country's liabilities to the donor country. Mr President, Honorable colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, we hope that the Agreement will be able to achieve all the goals he prescribes but we cannot be deceived that peace, stability and prosperity in southeastern Europe can be achieved without addressing issues that concern us:To involve Serbia in the reconciliation process of the region and - why not - in the review of relations between the European Union, the NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance that must be achieved between humanitarian involvement and state sovereignty, which I believe should change the map itself. Nl) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has changed everything. This is certainly the case and mainly to relations between the European Union and the Western Balkans. Since then, expectations have been high, both here and there. There because, whether we like it or not, alongside the request for immediate help there is the question: What does Europe actually want with us? Is there a prospect of accession to the European Union? These are the questions that seriously concern these countries. But here, in the European Union, expectations are high.	el
The private sector should be more necessary to involve the prospect of financial reality in the financing equation.It is also necessary to avoid that funded projects consist of projects based on income and on a small scale, difficult to follow, and favor the important plans whose repercussions are in most cases visible for all.In this way, we will reduce the need, on which we keep insisting, transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to use unnecessarily, in the long term, the plate of local tax in areas where these projects are located, and the European Parliament will show the importance it attaches to the need for such a reform.If Parliament supports these changes in the report today, these will make us, I think, go to the next phase of the pursuit of the historical objectives for which these funds have been created, namely the aid which must be financially sustainable to the disadvantaged regions of the European Union, which we must bring to a decent standard of living, not by giving them alms but stimulating them.I invite Parliament to support these modifications.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I also want to congratulate the rapporteur for his report, because it was difficult and serious work.There is no doubt that the structural policies and the cohesion policy of the European Union are the basic tools to create the conditions for the development and the reduction of economic and social inequalities in the regions.The latter, despite the advances that have been made, still experience high rates and, in terms of unemployment, inadmissible rates.To better achieve the objectives of these policies, it is essential to coordinate and organize them on the basis of well-developed, clever guidelines, I would say.Let us not forget that these policies, when they are effective, become tangible for the European citizen who benefits, who directly see the improvement of his quality of life.Let us not forget either that it will be necessary to give particular importance to the distant and island regions of the European Union because they suffer from fundamental handicaps in their economic and social development because of their geographical position.Except, of course, if the commission intends to connect them to the European continent by bridges or by tunnels under the sea!Finally, I would like to emphasize that structural policies, as a whole, call for greater flexibility to adapt to developments and thus respond to the new challenges and the chances that are emerging with the advent of a new millennium, for which we all want the best.Mr. President, there is no doubt that Ms. Schroedter's report contains a number of important observations and I congratulate him.But I am of the opinion that we should still worry even more about the orientations and results of the regional policy of the community.To summarize, massive unemployment, appalling, far from fade, is still worsening within the framework of structural policy.The economy and agricultural areas are irreparably affected by the regional policy practiced, with dramatic consequences on employment in the countryside and on the living conditions of farmers, mainly in the South.	fr
"The Commission fully supports the efforts that are provided in this regard, and it is currently studying the question of whether specific measures can be taken in the field of the environment.I must of course tell you how much I appreciate the role that the parliamentary committee of women and equal opportunities play here, and in particular its president.Allow me to recall that at the time of the inauguration of the members of the current commission, each one after the other, was questioned by the commission of women's rights on the way in which he intended to work for gender equality, in his field of particular activity.We intend to closely monitor the activity of each commissioner, and I therefore wanted, in this regard, also warn the other commissioners.Thank you for your answer!I actually draw the conclusion that you approve the need for an action plan - an action plan that aims to involve more women in work carried out in specific environmental fields.Let me also say that the Beijing Declaration pointed out how important it is to have the necessary institutional capacity to integrate the perspective of equality between men and women into any program in terms of environment.Institutions in this area, very often, do not have the knowledge or procedures necessary for the integration of such a perspective in their daily work.Obviously I would like to know if the commissioner is ready to include this idea of ​​equality in environmental policy and the programs that result from it.This is an important question.If we want the whole of our policy to be marked by this concern for gender balance, I think it is essential that high -level officials have the necessary fundamental knowledge..(SV) I understand of course the mainstreaming as a principle which must apply to all of our work.Questions related to gender equality play a very important role in the project which is being developed in my service.I am also ready to commit myself personally, for example by directing seminars on management responsibilities, or on other subjects, to encourage women to take care of new missions within the Commission.If we want to motivate all women civil servants, I think it is very important that this message is transmitted to all levels, from top to bottom or from bottom to top, as we will prefer.It seems to me that the work in terms of environment, in general, is often dominated by women.It is a trend that should be perpetuated, so that women can also obtain positions of responsibility or rise in the hierarchy of the instances that work on the environment.I assert that our action plan reflects this will, but it could certainly be improved.I have some experience in the field of implementation and monitoring of projects.I hope it can be useful.Question nº 43 of (H-0045/00): Subject: Boyne estuary and Drogheda port under the directive concerning the conservation of wild birds, the Boyne estuary was classified among the special protection zones (ZPS) and, because of its international importance, it is currently a question, in the context of the directive concerning the conservation of natural habitats,conservation.However, the Ministry of Navy, the Council of the County of Lurth and the Commercial Company ""Drogheda Corporation"" allowed the construction of a new port in the ZPS and even the elimination of a vase leash in Stegrennan, an area recently added to the ZPS, specially due to the insistence of the Commission."	fr
It would be very easy to grow these programs quickly and in time if we bring external professional experts, but this would undermine the whole purpose of the Urban program. I would like to make another observation before I conclude: We must insist where the money is granted and the program is being developed so that it is done in the context of a serious Urban development policy. Unfortunately, this did not happen in Ireland. I welcome the innovative approach to the Equal program and the aim of integrating groups that are the subject of discrimination in the labor market. Development partnerships are a very clever idea, although they are experimental. I have two major concerns about developmental partnerships. They should be accessible to smaller groups so that they can destroy, implement and monitor the programs. We need to have great flexibility within the program. I have also expressed concern about the use of a simple language rather than an incomprehensible specific terminology so that the program is accessible to everyone. I am glad to see this was accepted in the report, but I cannot agree with the amendment no.9, as this amendment in fact has not been formulated in any simple language. My second concern was that some groups that are discriminatory have special problems, for example the access of people with special needs in the workplace. Plans must also deal with this problem specifically. These concerns must be examined when drawing up programs. Personally, I intend to do so with organizations and groups in my constituency in West Midlands. I am now coming to the controversial issue of asylum seekers and refugees. Although I do not argue that those refugees have access to the Equal, to whom the refugee regime has not been granted and threatened with repatriation, I support the ability to access the program of all other asylum seekers and refugees. It is simply right and fair to be able to access Equal in the same way as other people. Mr President, dear colleagues, with the Leader report, the rural development is honored. This is not very often the case and it is enjoyable, given that Leader programs have been key elements in the Union policy for rural development. It should be reminded that these programs have been not only constructive elements of planning, but also fundamental means of economic and social cohesion in frequent sensitive areas such as, for example, in the areas in phase of aberration. It should be emphasized that, in order to become eligible for the Leader program, local agencies met, discussed and developed plans. As a result, these programs were important factors of participatory democracy, the logic of European citizenship. For this reason, the idea of ​​leader + must maintain all the positive aspects of the previous programs. Therefore, there is an urgent question: why, after ten years of success of these programs, to continue to limit Leader + to an experimental role? Are there many other European actions that can boast of having 800 highly successful specialized innovative experiences? How long will the committee still leave the leader at the stage of experimentation instead of making it go into the general concept of mainstreaming of rural development?	el
It is a conception that I firmly reject because competition is intended for citizens alone.Most companies hate competition.Competition is implemented and managed in the interest of citizens, in their economic interest and for their freedom.Examples of liberalization and competition in air transport and telephone services in Europe show that citizens have benefited.I can only repeat that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to approach all these concerns more competent and detailed next Monday, within the appropriate commission.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.I received a proposal for resolution1, in accordance with paragraph 5 of article 42 of the regulation, to close this debate.The debate is closed.We are now going to vote.(The Parliament adopts the resolution) Voting explanations We voted in favor of the resolution because this request had been made to us by a union of the French Post which hoped, in the event of a positive vote, an additional period to be able to defend the employees.This does not mean that we approve all the content, which is too vague and leaves aside the bottom.The policy pursued by European institutions and by national governments, in particular French, is a retrograde policy, contrary to both the interests of users, that is to say the vast majority of the population and those of post workers.Postal services must remain public services.All people, whatever the place where they are and whatever their social situation, must have access to it in the same way and under the same conditions.Any idea of ​​profitability must be excluded when it involves organizing the public service and it is not necessary to authorize private companies to garner private profit by monopolizing the activities most beneficiaries of the public service.It has been that La Poste and its equivalents in the different European countries should keep the monopoly of this service.To ensure, on the European Union level, suitable postal services, it is essential to end the policy which consists in removing local post offices, reducing the number of tours and overloading staff.On the contrary, it is necessary that La Poste and more generally all public services hire additional staff.The usefulness of these jobs is indisputable and creating a sufficient number would decrease unemployment in Europe.Mr. President, I personally voted for this resolution, because it is absolutely necessary to debate in the European Parliament of the postal service and get out of the current ambiguity.If we dismantle the public service, it will be very serious, and we want to know the intentions of the Commission.When we are told that we will serve the customer better and at a lower cost, it is obviously false.People who live far from everything will obviously not be served or will then have to pay dearly, and some of them will not have the means.	fr
"I find that the course of these reports somehow violate the command given to us. For example, we see the Ludford report proclaiming equality between European citizens and third -country nationals, reaching the point of suggesting that foreign European civil servants such as nationals of Member States can be made, or even enjoying the same rights in traffic without control and union rights. The differences are deleted at all levels, if at the Haarder report, the equality of rights between the same sex pairs and the traditional family are also declared. The two reports also call for one move to give immigrants to vote in local elections and European elections. The second category seems extremely indicative. Because the demand for participation in the local elections can sometimes be beautified by supposed practical reasons, but the request for participation in the European elections has a meaning purely ideological: the point is to show that future Europe should not be a super-national (and let's have a superior)They are redistributed all over the world. Another revealing common point: These two reports call for the new ""rights"" to be recorded on the map of the fundamental rights of the citizens of the Union, which is currently being drawn up, and on which I have already expressed my opinion yesterday, during the debate on the Duff-Voggenhuber report. And, of course, they insist on giving this document to binding legal force in the future with the Member States. Here is an additional element that proves that this map, if indeed approved in the form of the European Parliament calls for - but we will be completely opposed to it - it would act as a mechanism of restriction of nations. We also see, as always, that at the European level, resistance to pressure groups, eccentric minorities and even foreign interests is less. And from this we will again draw the same lesson: citizens must keep their powers close to them, and, if necessary, entrust them to institutions that will have transparency, they will be committed to defending citizens, while the latter will fully control them. We support the humanitarian perspective on which the exposure is based. We support the focus of the exposure to the roots of racism and xenophobia in Europe. We believe that it is important that the fight against racism and xenophobia is done by ensuring the right of citizens to education, the right to access to the labor market, etc. The recommendations of the exposure to gain better opportunities for the integration of third -country nationals are equally positive. For the aforementioned reasons we have chosen to vote in favor of the report, as we generally believe that it is extremely important to combat racism and xenophobia. We emphasize, however, that we cannot support the means recommended by the report on the fight against racism and xenophobia."	el
Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility, training in the cultural sector. Third, support for partnerships between cultural institutions. Fourth, expanding the public mainly by giving a great deal of space to young people and fifth, preserving and getting to know the common heritage of European range, as well as with the history of European peoples. The new program, with its structure, its organization based on transparency, efficiency and balance will be, I am sure of this, an efficient means of fundamental importance to our service. Madam President, thank you once again for parliament for both his support and for the fact that he once again proved the importance he attaches to culture within the Union. I am sure that he will not be disappointed with the support he provided and I am committed to informing it personally, at regular intervals, about the various stages of implementation of our action, the action of our citizens, for which I hope it will be a great action for the future. Thanks, Mrs. Commissioner. I think we can thank our rapporteur once again. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00.(The meeting ends at 21.55) Daily vehicles The Daily provision provides for the discussion of the recommendation for the second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position set by the Council for the issuance of the European Parliament's Directive and the Council of Council on the Council.(8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194 (COD) (Rapporteur: Mr. Florenz) Mr President, dear ladies and gentlemen, dear colleagues, nine million cars withdraw and end up in Europe every year in the press. These nine million cars, although they can no longer operate, have the ability to be the subject of cross -border trade and smuggling not only within the community but also beyond its borders. That is why it is in principle proper to designate the European Union Community rules for the recycling and processing of these nine million vehicles per year. As we believe, the directive presents some weaknesses that we would like to process here in the body in order to finally have a truly future directive. For this reason there are many amendments. I personally believe that the scope of this directive goes beyond its goal. I do not consider it necessary to include in this directive the historical vehicles or vehicles with collectible value. Nor do I believe that motorcycles should be included in this, because recycling is so widespread that it does not require a European directive. Also, I do not definitely seek such a large percentage of special vehicle recycling. My desire is for special use vehicles, such as ambulances, to greatly contribute to the salvation of people: this is my main concern. In my opinion, the Directive satisfactorily covers the obligations on the destruction of vehicles in Europe. We can leave it as the committee suggested. Member States will ensure the creation of appropriate reception plants that will remove liquids from vehicles, e.g. Over 32 million liters of used minerals will be deposited there, remove brake fluids, etc.	el
In addition, the agreements concluded with the EU will lead to an anchoring.They will irrevocably fix economic reforms, as well as the commitments of each party under the agreements will stabilize national and economic reforms.The reasoning behind this new approach is also based on the idea that combining free exchange policies in social development policies will lead to economic growth and a decrease in poverty.Improving the EU commercial regime for all less developed countries, 39 of which are in fact part of the ACP group, is another important aspect.This process will take place over the next five years, so that in 2005, essentially all the products of PVD exporters will have free access to the EU market.Regarding the volume of the next Fed, the EU has made a financial proposal.It is based on the principle aimed at reconciling the need to maintain a substantial level of financial resources in a period when official development aid budgets are limited with the need to increase the efficiency of community aid.Today, around 9.5 billion euros from the previous resources of the Fed are not the subject of any commitment.The EU undertakes to mobilize these remaining balances, in addition to the new FED resources, over a period of 7 years, that is to say before the entry into force of the next financial protocol.This will allow the community to substantially increase the annual flows of commitments and payments during this period.We are therefore not heading, in the coming years, towards a reduced period of activity, but towards a reinforced period of activity.Such a commitment implies an in -depth reform of the procedures and the methods of application on each side.There is a very real link between the reform process within the Commission as such, and our ability to keep our promises on the spot, which constitutes the basis of the agreement with the ACP countries.I come to our development policy.I would say that the global context has completely changed.The marginalization of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilizing effects of migration and the disturbing consequences of armed conflicts and pandemics, all these elements constitute major concerns.It is in this moving global context that we must be located.Fortunately, the EU aid assessments offer us a valid tool in order to improve our actions and, so let's hope, to take up the challenges I have just mentioned.Regarding more particularly the contribution made by these assessments, I would mention the following problems: the disadvantages of community policy are too numerous and too vague and that harms consistency.This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to the real inconsistencies that exist between policies and sectoral interests within the Member States.The commission's help regime is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms.Politicians are often more determined by available instruments than by clearly defined policies and priorities.Human resources are too low compared to the volume of the aid that we are supposed to manage.	fr
But we have the impression that this growth, fueled first by the performance of the United States, then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by new technologies of information and communication, is driven by the general march of the world, despite even our disabilities.We know these handicaps well, to which it is necessary to remedy an emergency, the structural rigidities, the excessive compulsory levies.But let's not forget that he has just added another, a new one, with the single currency.Indeed, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies impose on the different countries of the euro zone additional rigidities by imposing behaviors that are not necessarily adapted to their respective structures and conjunctures.This unification is considered positive by the report of the Commission.But, in reality, we cannot exclude that it does not lead to an overall sub-optimal situation.If we add the strangeness of a single currency which is not backed by a state, itself backed by a people, it is easily explained what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the distrust of the markets towards the Euro.Admittedly, the weakness of the single currency was able to be well received at first in 1999, since it favored growth in an unexpected manner, but one cannot eternally hide that it is actually the symptom of bad politicians and bad operating conditions.Mr. President, this draft resolution is disputed, which is hardly surprising given the subject which is dealt with there.Economists are not so unanimous, especially when it comes to the future.The rapporteur's carefree advocacy for greater economic growth seems to be an attractive way of fighting high unemployment.But in reality, it is short -term policy.He also campaigns for stable growth, but that has nothing to do with stability.Given the ecological and demographic developments, we should precisely encourage Member States to selective economic growth.A larger number of investments as well as production and consumption provide only short -term prosperity.The consumption of rare raw materials and energy must decrease significantly.Other priorities are the damping of high public debts and the restructuring of pension systems.If the Member States do nothing in this regard, there will be even less means for health care, education and other important public services in the future.A plea for more active public management is particularly well received.The latest Eurostat reports on ascending inflation, which now amounts to 2 % (the maximum authorized value), are not taken into account.Anyone who wishes more important public spending will hardly have to wait for the next increase in the interest rate of the European Central Bank.The jobs that the authorities can create are therefore reduced to nothing due to unfavorable developments, especially for small and medium -sized enterprises.The high unemployment rate within the European Union worries us all, especially since the downward trend does not seem to be maintained.	fr
"I think it is really the preference option to include this country with a peace solution in Cyprus in the European Union.Herring Council President, Commissioner!According to the Greece Communist Party, the main problem of Cyprus does not exist in its accession to the European Union, but in the now 26 -year -old occupation of 40 % of the Cyprical territory by Turkey.The future of the Cyprical people lies in the unity of this small country, regardless of the ethnic origin of every Cypriot.The only acceptable and promising solution, which does not allow a handling for foreign interventions such as those that have caused all problems of the past fifty years, is a united and federative Cyprus, as is also intended in the resolutions of the UN Security Council.The key to solving the Cyprus problem lies with the Turkish government, which supports and encourages the relentless attitude of the Turkish-Cypric leader upstasch.However, the European Union, with its alleged interest in freedom and human rights, has never been stirring, neither through the tragedy of the Cyprical people nor through the problem of Greek-Cypric refugees, neither by the violent change in the population composition in northern Cyprus nor through the massive settlement of Turks in the occupied areas.Even in this hall, the representative of the council spoke of the northern part of Cyprus and not of the occupied areas.The latest decision by Helsinki, Turkey, to give the accession status without making the slightest concession with regard to the line -up of Cyprus, for example by reducing its military presence there or returning Ammochostos, the Turkish side encourages to insist in an ineffective manner in its unequivocal position.It is no coincidence that Turkish Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit said immediately after Helsinki that the Cyprus problem had already been solved in 1974.This backing for the rigid attitude of Türkiye certainly does not contribute to the approximation of the two communities in the direct discussions under the patronage of the UN Secretary-General.The people of Cyprus have lost a lot on their way to join, and more will lose.The takeover of the community acquisition caused significant problems for the Cyprical economy, in particular agriculture.It requires the sale of the public sector, and it deregulates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity in this country.Mr. President, forgive, but the French cabin has just made a small translation error when it comes to Mr. Alyssandrakis, in the most delicate word of the entire debate.I don't want misunderstandings to occur here.In the French translation, Mr. Alyssandrakis is said to have said: ""The Confederative solution is the best"".However, Mr. Alyssandrakis clearly said, ""the federal solution is the best"".This clarification is extremely important, Mr. President.Thank you for clarification, Mr. Wurz.President, Malta and Cyprus, differ greatly from the countries on the European mainland.For example, the Maltese citizens understood excellently to survive in an unfavorable geographical and geopolitical environment.Their success is essentially based on her enterprising spirit, her dynamics and her flexibility.Malta has a successful light and heavy industry, an emerging financial service sector, a powerful agriculture, a flourishing tourism industry and a wide range of employment opportunities, all, although Malta has practically no natural resources."	de
"Regarding parliamentary approaches, I want to reiterate my thanks to all those, mainly to the rapporteur, who acted and intervened because most of the amendments of the Parliament were incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case, almost all, although with certain modifications and because in addition, we have improved the first supply in terms of funds.We were able to improve it by bringing fresh money, as we talked about at the time, and this was obtained while safeguarding the prerogatives and the skills of the Parliament.As for the commission, in this interinstitutional game, I think it is always important and I am delighted to underline it.I thank again all those who intervened, especially the Vice-President Provan also, for his wonderful participation throughout this debate, especially during the conciliation procedure, the president of the Industry Commission and also, in particular, Ms. Ahern and all the deputies who participated in this work thank you, Madam Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.Culture 2000 The agenda calls for the report (A5-0009/2000) of Mr. Graça Moura, on behalf of the delegation of the Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the Common Project, approved by the Conciliation, decision-making committee of the European Parliament and the Council establishing a single funding and programming instrument for cultural cooperation (""Culture 2000"" program (C5-0327/1999-1998/0169 (COD)).Madam President, I really think that we should no longer have discussed this because we have already said everything during the last debate.Alas, nothing has changed to the fact that the Council constantly discusses culture but does not pay money for culture.We have the feeling, and even conviction, that the Member States would be delighted to be able to erase what they registered in the Maastricht Treaty in 1992. For - Let's be clear - nobody really wants to pay money for culture.This is unfortunately so.We must see it.I would like to thank the rapporteur who, tirelessly, tried to identify this file, in cooperation, of course, with the commissioner.My faith, we had to take note of the fact that if we had achieved our objective on the merits, this was naturally not the case on the financial level.In such negotiation, which should actually generate unanimity, we find ourselves as helpless.The bazaar that takes place there is really not fair.There are always people who can refuse everything and, on the other hand, we, who we hold there, to be very additional money for culture.What we do there is really dishonorable.It is a terrible souk where relationships are unequal.We are nevertheless delighted that this program has become what we wanted to be.It corresponds to what citizens expect from us.We support modest and medium manifestations and not large manifestations;We offer easier access to citizens and lower actors."	fr
"This is how the common position was written. The same happens in the field of water transportation. Talking about water transport is to discuss wealth distribution, solidarity between peoples and territories, because the land is unfortunately not perfect and some areas have less and more. Finally, I find it extremely negative that the directive is not accompanied by a study of the impact. It is very easy for us to demand others to evaluate the effects, but on issues related to the environment we should also require it from ourselves, that is, to consider how many people, how many farmers may be destroyed by paying costs. There was a study that was not even read, and I believe that we should define the impact studies as a proper political practice. For the contrary, we give lessons. Mr President, through the strengthening of existing directives, this framework directive establishes the basic principles for a viable water policy in the European Union. It is a framework for the protection and management of our waters - surface, underground, international and coastal - through the introduction of a river basin in the national and, in our case in Ireland, at the cross -border level. Ireland warmly supports the common position and many of the European Parliament's amendments. A margin e.g.25 years of age for the legislation in force is barely accepted. We have no problem with the principle of ""pollution pays"" in relation to the recovery of cost from the use of water at an industrial, commercial and agricultural level. However, I am deeply convinced that, as water is life and access to clean drinking water fundamental human right, this directive must provide for free basic home water supply, a quota for every household for how much, cooking and hygiene. We should, of course, pay for waste and excessive use of water at home and cost recovery can be balanced accordingly. The introduction of water cash is treated with high suspicion in Ireland, as we do not have household water fees, and consequently meters, since 1977. Counts must be considered a very important means of managing water from new river basin areas to contribute to the river basin. The overall purpose of this directive is to promote sustainable water use in the EU. Water is an inadequate and valuable natural resource. The most ideal in my opinion would be for the amendment to fall tomorrow.45, in order to maintain the common position of Article 9 on the establishment of fees. This would allow the implementation of auxiliary to the policy of the costs of water charges, with each Member State preparing its own system, provided that the principles of this incentive directive on sustainable and effective use of water are fully protected. If amendment no.45 It does not fall, then I will have to submit an oral amendment tomorrow to ensure that the Member States will be able to provide exceptions from the provisions of that article in order to be able to use water at a key level for domestic purposes prior to the recovery of the costs regarding water services."	el
The fact that we do less but better - the central principle of the previous Commission - must also be the goal of this Commission. We look at this carefully when we get into annual legislative programs. Member Bond was right to say that we would imagine doing less but better, and then we have an annual program with 500 proposals and recommendations for 2000, which would work on the opposite. We need to agree on the focus areas and make sure that all these programs are worth the price. Finally, we need to make sure that a proper, real European Commission reform is implemented. Yes, just, the Commission's basic contract guard - must be an independent body, but it must also be accountable to European citizens through our parliament. The problem of access to information to which Member Bonde has just referred to is to be considered a forecast, and the Commission seems to be refusing us as citizens and members of the parliament, even though we are entitled to it under the basic agreements. In fact, the Commission is not currently the government of the Union. The Commission does not reflect the majority of this Parliament. We in Parliament have a significant task in shaping the Union administration. Thus, the administration must be an understanding administration so that we can cooperate and understand that each European Union institution has a significant task. Therefore, we need to have credibility, consistency and trust in our cooperation to improve the image of the European Union in the eyes of our citizens. Many President, Mr President of the Commission, in recent years, has taken many steps to strengthen the European Union since the euro, until the decision of the Parliament and the Commission's 14 member of the Austrian government, from the euro. These are decisions that I completely agree with in philosophy and principles. Mr Delibeable President of the Commission, despite all that you admit that you are right in the next few years that many steps are needed to confirm the EU over the next few years, as the European Union is not strong enough to survive the great and inevitable task of the expansion and the European Union is not strong enough to curb current and potential movements that have a two -legged and dual relationship to Europe. The values ​​of the integration of residents of our continent. This does not only apply to Austria. In the Amsterdam Treaty, the Union undertakes to its core values, and the EU institutions confirmed it once more when the Austrian federal government was formed. However, these values ​​will only become fully relevant when they are understandable in detail part of the contract and ultimately form the basis for individual citizens' legal claims. Articles 6 and 7 of the Agreement are not in all cases sufficient. In this sense, the Commission must - and I would like to strengthen and emphasize this in this context - must adhere to the fact that the re -establishment of a fundamental right will become part of the contract and that it creates binding and required rights. In this sense, the Commission must adhere to the continuous development of a common area of ​​freedom, security and justice, and in this sense I disagree with the two previous speakers. In order to counterbalance the rational, attractive, and wandering allegations of the extreme right, only rational, feasible and tolerant the principles of immigration and asylum rights can be set. However, this policy is, and this is what I want to underline, also follow-up, a solid and convincing policy that promotes employment and prevents social exclusion, as unemployment, marginalization and growing inequality form an ideal breeding ground for anti-European feelings and activities. Mr President of the Commission, in this context, I would also like to look at the globalization you raised and take it into consideration among large population parts. The feeling of insecurity, lack of influence and the state's inadequate protection, at best, leads to the abandonment and non -voting of politics, such as the European Parliament elections, and, in the worst case, extreme right -wing election behavior.	fi
The European Union is currently discussing aspects that, as hopes, China will take concrete measures.Based on these debates, the presidency will send the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union expects China to announce positive steps at the meeting on February 25th.In addition, the presidency will present the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases to which it wants to express their deep concern.At the conference carried out in Beijing in October 1999, it was confirmed on the one hand that the Chinese authorities were willing to make questions in connection with the actual dialogue, with the redesign of the dialogue and with the debate about the legal norms of law enforcement (death penalty, administrative arrest).On the other hand, however, you will not give in with the basic questions with regard to the system of the unit party and the territorial integrity.The debates in the European Union about the situation in China, which followed the results of the 1999 dialogues, made the European Union to make the decision to express its concern about the violations of human rights in China and the lack of concrete results of the dialogue, but also to recognize the positive steps that have taken China on an international level.On several occasions, the European Union has expressed its dissatisfaction with the results of the dialogue and assures that the Chinese authorities were expecting better results in certain, very sensitive areas.It was decided that the dialogue had to be continued, albeit more targeted and efficient, with China approving the European Union's proposal, redeveloping the dialogue through a better use of the experts and a closer connection with the seminars.Last but not least, the human rights commission will also deal with the rationalization of its own work at its next meeting.A working group deals with the revision of the mechanisms of the Commission, it has worked intensively and consent to the opinion that it is essential to increase the efficiency of the existing mechanisms and - especially in the financial sector - to give them a greater assertiveness.The European Union will oppose every unfair attempt behind which the intention is to remove the human rights commission through a realignment of its activities by reducing their field of activity and its constant attention for everything that concerns human rights in the world.Mr President, I would like to thank the chairmanship for his work, which he has done to prepare for the next meeting in Geneva with regard to the topics of racism, civil rights, political rights and the right to develop.As the Council Chairman said, there is still a lot of work ahead of us, even if the claim of the parliament and many NRO, the European Union should clarify its position in good time before the meeting in Geneva.This is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the most difficult questions.For example, many of the points contained in the Parliament's motion to be resolved, for example, and it is still too early to make a forecast of the results in the individual areas.It is not surprising that this debate is lengthy and difficult.	de
In this context, the European Union has to think about it - it started at the beginning of this week - like the neighboring country Yugoslavia - without even taking back criticism of this terrible regime - despite everything can be included in regional cooperation.I will therefore make an amendment tomorrow, with which we will advocate that the sanctions are concentrated on the regime, but on the other hand there are certain relief for the population and also for the economy in terms of economic cooperation.With this in mind, I am grateful - I can mention this because I come from a country through which the Danube flows - for considerations that the Commission, i.e.h.Commissioner Patten, but also Vice President Palacio, with whom I recently was in Budapest, namely to make the Danube again navigable in order to enable a minimum of an economic upswing again in this region, which of course would of course also be important for Romania.I take the view that this regional approach, if it is understood correctly, namely as a method to contribute something to the economic upswing in the region, is the right way.As I said, it must not be perceived as a compulsion and not placed as a prerequisite.Second, I would like to say clearly and clearly that Fyrom/Macedonia is open to the European Union and is offered.We consider it an illusion to believe that it makes sense to make an application for accession now, but we also think it is wrong, we will talk about that later.Now Macedonia/Fyrom wants to have the answer that it will have this option in principle when it comes to it.The country fears that it is placed on a siding.In the entire redesign of the funding instruments, it sees the risk of no longer being the last wagon of a train that moves towards Europe, but that this train moves in Europe and ends up on a siding.But I think that Commissioner Patten also understands that.I really ask him to make it clear with everything to make it clear in the corresponding conversations.Third: I think Macedonia/Fyrom has shown - at least so far - that it is also able to deal well with the instruments.Even if there are changes here, of course, Macedonia/Fyrom will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being done in Brussels today can be developed in Skopje in the future.I hope that the colleagues can agree to this that we accept these applications as a sign of good will to Fyrom/Macedonia.President!Since the beginning of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this short name - played a constructive and peace -resisting role.We are reminiscent of the suggestions of the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia-Herzegovina at the time, which aimed at a non-violent removal from the Yugoslav Federation structure.So our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role.For this reason, it must be said here that Macedonia is not simply the subject, but rather the origin of our so -called stabilization struts.	de
We could really ask ourselves, dear colleagues, why 76 % of Belgian citizens have no confidence in the justice of their country, 56 % of French citizens have no confidence in the justice of their country, 53 % of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in their justice ... (the president withdraws the floor to the speaker) Madam President, my group, EDD, and my party in particular, is very concerned about this debate.We cannot support, and we do not support, the opinions and the policy of Mr. Haider and we deplore his references to the third Reich.However, we also regret that your parliament plans to interfere in the policies of a government elected from any country whatsoever, especially when this country is part of the European Union.The party of which I am a member, in my country, is certainly not racist, but we do not gladly accept the laws and interference of the European Union.Are you going to get through the British Parliament if we are elected?Madam President, the citizens of Austria decided to elect Mr. Haider to their parliament.I think it has received 28 % of the vote, therefore Germany will have a coalition government.Let me say that your Parliament, the president, should wait to see if Mr. Haider's party influences the policies of this country.So, and only then, you can wonder if human rights are affected.Your parliament may consider appropriate measures to counter this situation and then, the president, and only then, your parliament can consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union.Madam President, as a deputy for the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns of certain colleagues regarding democratic evolution in Austria.You may be surprised by my reaction if I affirm to be personally unable to understand the exacerbated reaction manifested against Austria and which wonders about its respect for human rights, its ability to assume its past and the stability of democracy.Austria must assume the often doubtful image which prevails in its account, rightly or not, abroad.For years, the refusal of our governments to admit our share of guilt in the horrors of the Second World War and to grant just compensation to Jewish victims and forced workers has significantly contributed to this negative image.Now the FPö has committed, on the basis of the result of the October 3, 1999 elections which sanctioned the former government, in a coalition government with the ÖVP.It is the right of citizens of a state because it is the fundamental principle of a democracy.After the failure of the talks between the spö and the ÖVP, the socialists tried to form a minority government and asked the support of the FPö.You just have to read the newspapers: three ministerial posts were offered to this very party whose fascinating trends are denounced here.When we have declined this offer, incendiary propaganda, which we still do not understand, suddenly exploded.	fr
They use Swedish as a warning example. This may be done for some things, but not just about this. In a circular letter, it has been claimed that stamp prices would have risen by 59 % since the 1993 release. It is true if we take into account only the 20 % of the postal market that still has a monopoly in practice and in other words the state is the only player. Free competition applies to 80 % of the market and has lowered prices. This shows that the competition really works. My conclusion is: Make sure that the competition will also be extended to the remaining 20 % share! As a result, more people miss ... (Markov, a member of the Parliament, interrupted the speaker.) I thought I had a speech. We may discuss this a little later. However, I can say that things are exactly what I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where competition is competing, while prices have risen in areas where there is a monopoly. This almost always happens. Therefore, I demanded that the Commission take the necessary measures and to ensure that effective competition could be extended to the postal sector. Good member Markov, you have a couple of minutes to talk about 56 minutes after 56 minutes. I would be grateful if you didn't interrupt your colleagues. Mr President, is downright mystical, what happened to the Postal Directive, which was issued on December 15, 1997. The Commission has been very quiet since that time. I'm sorry that the Commission member Monti is here today. I like him a lot. He is one of the most diligent and hard -working members of the Commission. It is unfortunate that I can't say the same for some of his colleagues. No real development for the Postal Directive has taken place during this time. The Commission member Monti said that part of the reason for this has been the organization and redistribution of tasks. This is only recently done. However, the previous Commission had more than a year to do something about it. We really haven't progressed far. Now, however, as a member of the Commission Monti is present, I would like him to take a message to Bolkestein and tell him what the postal dators are concerned about. It is a matter of gradual release of postal services, guaranteed and affordable general service, direct mail mail and abroad. These were essential in the report and should be essential for all future directives. Postal services are not only for Christmas, but for the whole life. For the Scottish area I come from, this form of service is much more than just postal service. It is a force that unites communities. It is also a bus service, social service and medical service. If we let the postal services drift into privatization, we will lose all of this and many of our local communities - and just voted on tourism - lose their income from tourism. The reason will be ours. Postal services are important. This post must be brought to the attention of the Commission and the Commission must listen to it. Mr President, we support the release of postal services in the European Union. It must primarily mean that customers are better served. This is about and must be the goal. The release was started because there were doubts about the structure of the postal services and the value of the monopoly position. Is the monopoly flexible in a market where customer demands can change very quickly and can develop a different market situation very quickly, for example, as much more electronic data transfer is used? So the question is: What possible requirements do we have to set for the monopoly or for the part of the services that the monopoly controls? Most Member States are restrained by this issue, and I am pleased that the new government of my home country has finally implemented what should have happened long ago, and that the Belgian Posti and the Belgian government are now implementing to ensure that the postal service is at least somewhere ready to face competition by 2003.	fi
President, values, values ​​that the rules must be observed, is a matter of course, as is the demand that our partners also comply with them.Understandably, we are worried about this today, but I don't want our claim to be understood as selectively.And I also don't want our oral request to be understood as an indictment.Since our claim is not selective, the Commission must also feel asked to deal with the use of the community money in the neighboring regions of Israel.And since the request to the Commission is not an indictment and must not be regarded as such, I would like to highlight two essential points here for the balance of our attitude.First, who knows the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is closely linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel.The Oslo protocol provides for a customs integration that includes Israel and the Palestinian Authority.And everything that amounts to a division of the two economies would harm Israeli-Palestinian cooperation, including the joint ventures, the Palestinian suppliers and exporters.Second, the borders of the state of Israel are nowhere in more detail in the agreements between Israel and the European Union.The determination of these limits is particularly important in the ongoing negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.Any attempt by the European Union to want to enforce its own view of Israel's territoriality would be at least a clumsyness that would be detrimental to this negotiations and our idea of ​​the role of Europe in this region.I support the prudent procedure of the commissioner on this matter, especially because this is not a simple question.It is so complicated because it is always difficult to determine the origin and origin of goods.This also applies to the Middle East, where there are numerous joint ventures and some of them are produced in the Palestinian area and partly in the state of Israel, and that's a good thing.These developments vote confidently for the future because this type of trade in the Middle East prepares the ground for a peace agreement.Especially because this is not a simple and easy to solve question, we have to proceed carefully and carefully.The second reason why it is correct that the Commission acts in this way and not otherwise is as follows: If the European Union wants to participate in peacekeeping in the region, it must be fair and fair.However, it would not be fair and just to decide hastily without having talks and meet groups in order to hear their assessment of the situation, both with regard to the area of ​​the state of Israel in relation to the trade agreement as well as, as already mentioned, the goods and its origin.In my opinion, there is another reason to support the Commission.The peace agreement is in a delicate phase.The Israeli government wants to peace, a safe peace, and a premature and over -falling approach could endanger the success of the peace agreement.The negotiations cannot be found the best, this is about a comprehensive solution extremely more difficult questions, and I think the commission acts completely correctly if it carefully weighs, hoping that we can reach this in this way, according to which we all strive, namely a safe, just and permanent peace in the Middle East.	de
"From this point of view, the events that we experience in Austria must be considered tragic.For the first time since the Second World War, an open pronazist, racist and xenophobic party in a European country is ahead of the gates of power.In view of this danger, which the negation of the most very important idea of ​​the European structure, we must not be stopped by anything - not from the legal atmosphericities about what the contract allows and what is not, not from the legitimate questions about the right to interference, not from the ridiculous respect against formal democracy and, above allreject, but on which we have no influence.As a member of the French overseed part of La Réunion, a melting pot, the population of which over the past three centuries of Europeans, black Africans, Madagasses, contract workers from India and Pakistan and also Chinese, I experience the deep truth of the saying of Saint-Exupéry every day: ""If you are different, then I will be my brother, thenThis is not reset, but enriched.For all of these reasons, I decided on the resolution presented to our house about the formation of government in Austria.The rise of Jörg Haider by forming a government between the FPÖ and the conservative right is the resurrection of a historical monster in Europe. The success of the FPÖ is both due to the fact that it was made hopeful by the Austrian rights and social democracy, as well as their politics, whose disaster social consequences have prepared the right -wing extremism.In the resolution, any diplomatic measures for the political isolation of the new government are announced, but without saying even a word about the deeper causes of the resurrection of fascism, which is due to the despair of the population groups that have fallen victim to the king, as well as the decision of the prevailing classes, on a strong regime in order to further increase the reduction and the regulatory policyto be able to.In order to counteract the xenophobic appearance of a dictator apprenticeship, which the Third Reich longs for, every opportunity must be used to express our solidarity with the Austrian anti -fascists.That is why we vote against this resolution despite its lying references to a ""European democratic model"" that resembles more of a fortress that pursues immigrants without papers and disclosed and even recorded young people.- I have just voted against the situation in Austria against the situation in Austria in view of a possible government formation between the ÖVP and FPÖ.I consider the upgrading of Jörg Haider as ""Buhmann Europe"" - worse neo -Nazi and head racist - to be counterproductive.Of course, I by no means agree with the published statements of this right-wing populist and judge xenophobia and every trivialization of the Hitler regime.However, I am afraid that a reaction of Europe that is only emotionally shaped will multiply the Haiders followers to the processes in Austria."	de
of the Committee on Legal Issues and Internal Markets.(Es) Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I would like to first praise the exquisite work done by Mrs Berger and, in general, the Committee on Legal Affairs, which included innovative ideas in this directive that I hope will be validated by the Commission and the Council. However, I tabled an amendment. Mrs. Berger, at the 6th justification point in your amendment no.2 Call the legal security. The first point we disagree with is the extension to the three months of the residence permit, since all it does is create legal insecurity. You are - and it is reasonable - a reflection, which was also expressed by Mr Wieland, for the ability to disappear an employee unnoticed as soon as his residence permit expires, but I believe that at the same time, this possibility is facilitated by the extension of three months. If the validity of the service receipt expires on a given date, it must expire on this date. This requires legal security. On the other hand, with regard to point (d) of amendment 10 referring to the first Directive, you say, for reasons of public security and under public order rules, a Member State may not accept the validity of the license. There are already some in advance checks provided for in Article 4 of the Directive. It makes no sense for any employee of the Schengen area, since he has already been inspected to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State may in advance, but he may refuse to justify the entry of this employee into his territory. So it makes no sense to maintain this legal insecurity. If this is not a state of the Schengen area, in the last paragraph of my amendment no.22, this possibility is provided, which is completely controlled, and I believe with more legal security. The discretion of the state you mentioned in point (e) of your amendment no.10 I think it is not consistent with the overall text of your excellent report. Consequently, I call on my colleagues to examine my amendment carefully and I hope tomorrow we can come up with an outcome. At first glance these two proposals appear to implement certain procedural changes in order to facilitate the free movement in Europe's territory and to recognize the validity of recent judicial decisions referred to by Mrs Berger in her introductory observations. However, in the case of the United Kingdom, we believe that they are moving more in an unacceptable way. This is partly deemed to be in the substance and partly on the legal basis, regarding the particular position of the United Kingdom. Under the provisions of the circumstances, the United Kingdom maintains its border controls. Under the system proposed in these legislation, third -country nationals wishing to go to the United Kingdom in the context of the procedures described will do so with the help of a service card issued by another Member State, bypassing the UK border controls. If the current border regulations of the United Kingdom are going to change, this change should be made by the government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not through the European legislative process.	el
"In the last week of February, 39 such inhumane incidents were found only in the Erika wreck area. These practices are unbearable, but they are difficult to control, especially at night or under fog. This Directive proposal and the amendment aimed at establishing a universal port taxation of ships in all European ports to finance their waste processes are interesting in two respects: on the one hand, they oblige the ports to equip themselves and to organize themselves or to process soles or soles toAnd, above all, they discourage ships to avoid their obligations for waste treatment, since they will pay the cost anyway. We must, however, ensure that this measure of universal taxation is accompanied and combined as possible with national or European funding measures that allow small ports to access waste processing services without relicly raising the economy and therefore their duration. Under this condition, the proposal of this Directive is a first exemplary reaction of Europe to the reasonable emotion caused by pollution due to Erika's wreck. It is in some ways the first step in recognizing and setting up a European marine space that will be subject to common rules. The Council had already needed to discuss long on the issue of this Directive on Port Waste Reception Facilities, but the text in which it had respected the principles of reinforcing the protection of the marine environment taking into account the reality of each of the Member States, without overturning the text. In fact, a state such as France has already begun to apply the provisions of the MARPOL Convention, guaranteeing that each port has waste and quality reception installations, which have been undertaken by private companies, which send their invoice directly to the shipowner according to their type of waste and their disposal:so -called ""ecological"" ships. This solution, which favors the ships most respectful of the environment, seems far more fair than an arbitrary reduction of which will benefit - on the basis of what criteria?- allegedly ""ecological"" ships and from an contribution that will be paid indiscriminately, regardless of the use of facilities. We therefore refuse to replace a tax that takes into account the nature of waste with a blind tax policy of all ships that are seize in the ports, regardless of their environmental danger. It should also be noted that the ""cleansing of tanks"" at sea is unfortunately very much independent of the taxation system: only by sea controls and more frequent fleet controls parked in intermediate ports could the rejects be reduced. For all these reasons, the Group Union for Europe of Nations, recalling its agreement with the Council's common position, opposes this report that has altered the principles of the common position."	el
The clear statement of the contents of the feed makes it possible to free the freedom of choice of both those who use and later consumers. The mature citizen should - in my opinion - make the relevant decisions himself. We are all talking about scandalous citizens who have lost their confidence in food safety. With the consistent regulation of additives in feed we can now contribute substantially to the restoration of confidence. Therefore, I am very curious how to deal with our amendments. For these reasons, our vote will be such that, if needed, we can renew our proposal to the Commission. Mr President, dear colleagues, this proposal to amend the directive on the added materials in the animal nutrition, dating back to 1970, is the first of a series of proposals on the issue of feed. In the coming months we will discuss several more proposals here in Parliament. The enormous importance of this issue is evidenced by the very much attention that public opinion has given to the scandals of dioxins, antibiotics and sewage sewage. So this is an important element of the protection of public health. Therefore, we are of the opinion that Article 152 and not Article 37 proposed by the Commission should be used as a legal basis. The amendment proposed by the Commission, in particular the equal treatment of additional materials approved before and after 31 December 1987, is not disputed and has our full support. The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, however, has formulated some important amendments to the committee's proposal, which were approved there unanimously. The arrangement proposed by the Commission has the risk of monopolies forming in the marketing of certain additives. The right to apply will only be the one who had been granted the initial authorization, and excludes undertakings in which the license was later granted. We should block such a monopoly conditions that could lead to e.g. Increasing the price of feed, and grant temporary licenses to all businesses that traded a particular substance on April 1, 1998. The provisional license will be valid until the procedure for a re -evaluation of their file is completed. The most important amendment to the Commission's proposal concerns, of course, is the inclusion in the directive on additional provisions for genetically modified organizations. This amendment is proposed by the rapporteur by taking the starting point for the compromise solution negotiated by the parliament and the Commission on the approval of genetically modified organizations outside the Directive on deliberate release of genetically modified organisms in the environment. This compromise is already the basis for the approval of genetically modified organisms. Consequently, it is very reasonable to predict in this case of corresponding provisions on genetically modified additives in feed, respectively to the arrangements we have already established in other areas - and I mention the field of forest proliferative material. The marking of genetically modified additives is of great importance. It allows the farmer to decide consciously whether he wants to use such feed and the consumer on the other hand to reject foods made on the basis of genetically modified organisms. Finally, I would like to address the warm thanks of our team to the rapporteur, who made great efforts. I think we can wait with curiosity the answer that Mr. Byrne will give	el
President, colleagues!I ask you to apologize for my delay, but today God is unfortunately still on the agenda.The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy recommends that you release the 35 million euros, and this recommendation is given because this money can really benefit the people concerned.What makes us critical is not so serious that we didn't want to help people there.But this does not mean that we forget the criticism.Of course, we would be much further in our procedure if the council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament at an early stage and officially forward documents.This is the only way we could have done a really reasonable, in the matter of profound advice.I ask the administration to ensure that this can no longer happen in the future.Only because of the people concerned are we ready to refrain from drawing consequences.But we have to see that we introduce certain conditions here.One condition is that the money is given where it is applied sensibly, and not to those who may be able to use this money in order to pursue other purposes, that is, this money should really go into the responsibility of Mr. Kouchner and not into other areas.Second: Even if the Commission and the Council take a different position here because they see realistic problems, we think that the other donors also have to comply with their obligations that they have received.This is a mission that is under the jurisdiction of the United Nations, and it cannot be that the European Union alone fulfills its obligations!The other donor countries must also meet their obligations during this period in the interest of the people concerned.This means that in the future we generally have to deal with this question much more intensively, not only with this specific project, but with the entire development in Southeast Europe and the help that is given there.This in turn is an example of the fact that the European Union is ready to help the money, but that there is an inconsistency of political leadership.We have so many coordinators who are responsible for so many employers that we will soon have a coordinator for the coordinators.Perhaps it would be better if the responsible bodies of the European Union and the other institutions - from the OSCE to the United Nations - were put together in order to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to check how people can really be helped there.I know that the Commission is intensively considered to achieve this, but if the European Union does the most, it should also have the management there and then bring it in a uniform way so that people can really be helped.There is no point in that we have a competition between the different international institutions and associations than that the strength is really tackled to help people on site!When I see that the encoder conference for the stability pact is being moved further and now, now to the end of March that nobody knows which projects are really behind it if you cannot see in how really being implemented and only new press conferences are given, then this does not seem to be the way we can produce peace and reconciliation of people in this area!	de
"In a common fishing policy, the requirements of species protection and inventory management must be optimally reconciled with those of the economy and the market.For this purpose, extensive, comparable and uniform data, of which we - if they are properly recorded and evaluated - serve more general information about the fishing sector in the Union.However, we also hope that the peculiarities, the differences, the diverse fishing conditions and traditions are better recognized and emphasized and not - as happened in many ways - due to a misunderstood harmonization concept for fishing policy, restricted, restricted or even eliminated.As an example, I would like to lead the Mediterranean and in particular the fishing in Italy.After the GFP for the Mediterranean has been limited to prescriptions for marketing and operating aid for years, regulation 1626 and the measures included in it are finally launched to maintain and protect the fish stocks in order to ensure permanent use of inventory.This is a objective that can be agreed, but when implementing the biological peculiarities of the fish species of the Mediterranean were sometimes not observed.A later regulation, namely the - by no means passed in 1999 - Regulation No. 1448 left some exceptions especially for so -called ""certain Mediterranean fishing"".However, this exemption only applies until May 31 of this year, and the Commission must submit a proposal by then.We hope that this fishing system, which is of vital importance for the economy of extensive coastal areas and, according to the scientific data that has been recorded so far, has a certain sustainability under the aspect of biological tolerance.Thank you very much, Mr. Fischler.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.The report (A5-0036/2000) from Mr. Hudghton follows on behalf of the Council for a guideline for a directive 93/53/EEC to determine minimum measures by the community for combating certain fish epidemics.The infectious anemia of salmon (ISA) is an infectious viral disease that was first registered in Norway in 1984, later in Canada (1986) and finally in May 1998 in Scotland and thus for the first time on the territory of the European Union.Although the virus has also been found in other species, the disease itself has so far limited itself to salmon.The virus cannot survive at a temperature of over 25ºC, and the scientists therefore agree that it is not a danger to human health.It simply cannot survive in warm -blooded creatures.The Scottish salmon breeding industry is the largest of its kind in the EU, and its locations are in the extreme outskirts in areas.It offers about 6,500 people work and generates around 800 million euros annually.It is therefore obvious that this problem for Scotland is of particular scope, but it is of the utmost importance for all parts of Europe that this disease is contained and exhausted if possible.According to the currently applicable guideline, vaccination is prohibited, instead all fish of an affected farm must be killed regardless of whether they are infected or not."	de
With the ratification of the Amsterdam contract, all Member States have expressed that they want to give the same priority against the combating of fraud against the financial interests of the European Union as to combat fraud at their own burdens, but the reality is that the first four member states have only ratified the agreement decided in 1995.The Commission fully agrees with the rapporteur that this situation is not acceptable.A legal act, a guideline in which the fraud, such as money laundering or bribery, is defined uniformly and its law enforcement is bindingly laid down as a goal, can continue to bring an important step further here, and I will therefore propose to the Commission to check this step very quickly.The European Office for Combating Olaf is one of the most important instruments with which the Commission fulfills its obligation to combat fraud.The Commission therefore did not accept that the two European banks ECB and EIB have denied Olaf's right to investigations in these two institutions with reference to their independent position.The Commission therefore decided to collect these two banks in its last session, and I hope that the parliament will approve of this step.The second recommendation of the present report concerns the review of Olaf's examination measures in the various European institutions to their legality.The surveillance committee for Olaf, which was also established with the establishment of Olaf, has the task of ensuring independence from Olaf, but cannot carry out the activity of internal investigative acts in the report.In it I completely agree with the surveillance committee and the rapporteur.This means that there is a gap that must be filled out and I will check the path proposed in the report in terms of further development.However, I can ask for one thing: I think it must be prevented that the debate about an expansion of the legal basis for Olaf leads to the misunderstanding that Olaf does not have enough authority now.No, it must not lead to an undermining of Olaf's authority, and I also think that this is not in the interests of the rapporteur.In this respect, I ask you to fully support Olaf's work in the current form.Thank you very much, Ms. Schreyer.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Votes (the parliament accepts the Commission's proposal.) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE).(En) Mr. President, a remark on the application of the rules of procedure.I ask for an explanation of Article 133 paragraph 2 and 138 paragraph 4 of the rules of procedure.Both articles concern the vote.Isn't it the case that, with the exception of votes, is initially coordinated by a hand signal and should only be reached for the electronic voting system in case of doubt?Yes, Value Mr colleague, I had a hand signal voted because no faction had asked for a name.As you know, a name or electronic review is only intended if the MPs require this.In the present case, I can assure you that an overwhelming majority voted for the guideline that we have just voted.Mr President, I did not mean this special coordination, but votes in general.	de
"Mr President and the Monitorial Colleagues, the European Commission, tried to create a European water policy almost 30 years ago. The regulation had to be achieved in 129 chemicals. In the end, the standards were prescribed for only about ten substances. This accident was due to the principle of consensus. Seven years ago, it seemed that European water policy was sacrificed on the altar of the principle of subsidiary. Conservative principals of the government, Major and Kohl, decided at the Edinburgh Summit at the fireplace fire that it is not at all necessary for Spaniards to get as good drinking water as German or English. This view is partly shining through the common position resulting from the Presidency of the UK Socialists. This strain is like a hole cheese, or to use water terminology, it leaks like a screen. This explains why the Committee on Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Policy has provided so much reviews. Almost a hundred checks have been submitted for the second treatment. It is unusual, but most of the checks are very needed to support the leaks. One of the bad leaks is dangerous chemicals. The chemical industry, and unfortunately the European Commission and the Council of Ministers, want to do a separate risk analysis from every hazardous substance. It took a lot of time, and more importantly, there is no acceptable level of pollution caused by dangerous chemicals. Only in the ocean is acceptable. This means the term ""near zero"". The Commission already has a list of 32 primary substances ready. Many of them adversely affect hormone function. They are so -called hormone -damaging substances. Even at extremely low concentrations, they cause changes in animals and even human sex, which scientists are increasingly noting. Therefore, it is so important that the European Parliament is in favor of OSPAR's goals from almost zero to 2020. I would like to deal with two substances mentioned in the Commission list. They are mercury and tributylith, abbreviated TBT. At the bottom of Waddenze, the mercury content is ten times and TBT concentration is one thousand times higher than OSPAR value. As a whole of the chemical industry and society, you need to learn to replace these dangerous chemicals with harmless options, and if it is not possible, to handle them in closed systems. For TBT, this means that it must no longer be used as a algae. Mechanical cleaning of sides is a good option. I would like to end my wish that the European Parliament will once again adopt its green image and that the concentrations of hazardous chemicals and hormone -damaging substances would be nearly zero in 2020. Mr President has a decisive role in the processing of this Water Directive. The common position of the Council is completely inadequate in many matters. Our job must now be to tighten and concretize the requirements of the Directive. For us GUE/NGL members, certain principles have been particularly important when we have commented on different proposals. First of all, we believe that to carry out the actions presented in the deadline, there must be a shorter period of time proposed by the Council. Therefore, we support proposals relating to the tightening of the deadline for the implementation of the various parts of the Directive. Secondly, I want the gradual reduction of the use of dangerous substances consistently. It must not be delayed due to the introduction of new evaluation requirements before taking action. Requirements for respecting legislation also include respect for respecting international agreements, such as the OSPAR regulations. Thirdly, we want pricing policy to be clearly expressed. This means that the main principle must be to pay for the actual cost of water use. Today, taxpayers often have to support industry and agriculture. The clear starting point for the legislation must be that the pollutist or the user pays, although it may require exceptions in certain extreme cases. Fourth, we want only minor and clearly limited exceptions to the rules of water quality."	fi
"And as long as we continue to have the unanimity and as long as the Dutch government could impose these 167m euros in the final and as tomorrow a government with Mr Haider will tell us what cultural activities we will have, we will not go ahead. That is why it is very important for the intergovernmental to make important decisions and to make intersections in order to release this commitment of each government to the European Parliament's attempt to give a significant cultural impetus to the European space. Bortone (Uen).(It) Madam President, I fully share the evaluations made by the rapporteur, and I also thank the Chairman of the Culture Committee, Mr. Gargani, for the commendable work he performed in a substantially difficult procedure. The need to simplify and strengthen the previous programs had definitely been found, but we all wished that the CULTURE Plan could really contribute to the promotion, for example the particularities of each cultural sector, and most importantly I would say, even those who are less well known, and perhaps more. We wish that this will happen, at least at the level of evaluation. We believe very much in the effectiveness of cultural actions, even in terms of contributing to social, as well as in the economic development of a people. And Europe, for the most part, can compete with the rest of the world, rediscovering its roots, bringing to light the common cultural heritage, exploiting and recovering the islands of culture and language that have remained unknown so far. Regarding the great educational task to fulfill by the European Union of the Cultural Dimension, one of the most obvious restrictions on the program is the distribution of funding - we have heard it many times - which testifies that - at least on the side of the Council, and not of Mrs.primary position in relation to social integration. A total development of the European Union and the realization that we are European citizens: for this very reason we believe that the ""Culture 2000"" program, even with poor funding, can substantially contribute to this common goal. Madam President, I will be presented with tonight's unanimous opinion and declare that I will support the approval of the ""Culture 2000"" program, thanking the rapporteur, Mr. Graaa Moura, who took the baton from our former colleague Nana. Both did first -class work. Next to the discussion we had earlier during the day, culture may not seem so important. However, it is. And we must make sure the European Parliament does not allow the urgency to hinder the important. Why do I argue that culture is important? Speaking in simple economic terms, European culture increases true prosperity. Where would the European tourism industry be found without the wealth of our culture? Even more important, however, is that cultural activities constitute the culture of humanity. Democratic beliefs are based on culture, and a liberal society will not be preserved tolerance, freedom and democracy."	el
Is this the message we want to transmit?In addition, one particular point holds me to CUR: Member States must be able, when they wish, decide to set up transnational water transfers.This type of project responds to the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity that we have always defended.In this spirit, it should largely benefit from the support of the European Union, within the framework of the promotion of the Transeuropée networks and the regional policy (through structural funds).I would like to recall that our assembly adopted, two years ago, an initiative report on the technical feasibility of the Transseuropéen hydraulic networks and I would appreciate that the European Commission can soon inform the European Parliament as a result it has given to this report..(Es) We attended the transformation of a report which was first concerned with the quality of water in Europe into a trade war instrument.We all agree to say that water quality is an objective of primary importance, especially because of the opposing consequences that the development of the accelerated industrial growth model has on nature.It is obvious that the logic of private profit specific to this model has been harmful, which is why the principle of polluter pays is adequate to deal with these consequences.But beyond these principles, water must be considered as a common good that cannot be subject to market rules.Surprisingly, I imagine that with the best intentions, we transformed this ecological objective into an instrument of commercial war by making consumers support, especially in the agricultural sector, the price of installations and procedures so that water is of good quality.In fact, water becomes a commodity more subject to market laws.The neoliberal model is thus applied to water.When we do not differentiate the countries and regions where water is abundant, and does not pose any problem, regions where drought and low rainfall make it a rare good, limiting their possibilities of minimum economic and social development, we already alter the ecological principle to make it a devastating weapon.In the same vein, it is somewhat ironic to complicate the possibility of sharing this property, which for certain areas is rare, while those who live in regions where water abounds give water restriction advice to those who live in regions affected by drought.It is this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, which motivated my vote, as a deputy from one of the Mediterranean agricultural regions dry but with prospects like the Murcia region.On behalf of the Labor Party in the European Parliament, I would like to indicate that, although we have supported most of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations.The date set in the report - 2020 - is not realistic and impossible to respect, but the date set by the Council - 2034 - is too distant.We therefore believe that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	fr
"We move to votes.1 Voting President, I use the speech on behalf of Spanish members of the European People's Party, on behalf of the members of the Spanish People's Party, the resolution of Terrón I Cusí, which deals with the area based on freedom, safety and justice. In fact, in some votes, we have not followed the guidelines of the European People's Party, but we have voted for the resolution of Terrón I Cusí, which we think is excellent overall. However, we have voted against paragraphs 2 and 6 because we do not think they are not relevant from a legal point of view. In contrast, we have voted on the introductory part J, which in fact corresponds to what I proposed as a preparation for the statement in the Committee on Freedom of Civil Freedom for the inter-governmental conference. We have also voted for paragraph 13. The Spanish People's Party has long defended the fact that third-country citizens have a proper position and the right to mobility and establishment. For similar reasons, we have voted for paragraph 14, from which the oral review removed certain highly justified concerns about the subject matter, as political rights, no longer the right to vote in municipal elections, but in general, are in the sovereign of the Member States. It seemed that we could vote for the point through an oral review, and so we did..(DA) The Danish Social Democrats of the European Parliament have decided to support a resolution proposal, but at the same time they note that certain matters are at odds with the exemption of the Danish legal matters - an exemption from the Danish delegation of the PSE Group..(FR) In this resolution I voted against, not so much about human rights, but about communalization and, in reality, strengthening the European fortress. The ""progress"" mentioned in the resolution in 1999 is only true for the Dublin Convention, the Schengen Code and other action plans in Tampere, which restrict the rights of immigrants. In fact, human rights are about recession. Europe will continue to expel third-country citizens to countries that the Agency considers to be dangerous, while some of the Central and Eastern European countries who have applied for membership in the European Union receive a large extent expelled from Belgium. Kosovo's Albanians and Serbian Serbian Serbian, Serbian, are prohibited by refugee status while Pinochet avoids his trial. Indeed, Schengen Europe is more likely to harass the persecuted of southern countries than dictators, although the UN estimates that we need 159 million immigrants by 2025 to keep the population in balance. Europe first legalize the situation of all their unrelated residents, and let them grant asylum and voting rights in all elections, so we can only talk about an area based on freedom and court in this session. McCarthy report (A5-0026/2000) Mr President, first and foremost, I would like to say that I had been the mayor of Bilbao in the 1990s and had the opportunity to present one of the first Commission's supporting Urban experimental projects. We drawn four conclusions from the experience we received from that pilot project in Bilbao: first it is necessary that Europe has an urban planning policy. Instead of deducting the EUR 900 million in the previous five -year period to EUR 700 million for the current five -year period, this program should be increased, for example - and as we have proposed in the Greens / European Free Alliance group - by allocating to the URBAN projects that the Member States have not been used by the Member States. Secondly, efforts must be concentrated in overall projects when deciding on what areas to support. Distributed actions are not effective. The most receding and lacking cases for all set goals, that is, the social, economic and environmental and democratic administration, must be chosen and set prioritizing. Thirdly, Synergy with other community programs and the potential of sustainable development in the area or area must be taken into account. Finally, you have to trust the institutions that are closest to the citizens, namely and supported by municipalities and local bodies."	fi
Mr. President, dear colleagues, I don't need to remember what the rapporteur said before me and my colleague Coelho.All this is indeed correct and relevant.The euro can easily be falsified.We are currently in a dangerous transition phase during which an unprecedented phenomenon arises on the criminal level, namely that a currency not yet used, not yet put into circulation, but which only acts as a scriptural currency, can nevertheless already be the object of falsification, and this while the offense of false coinage is in this specific case listed by no sanction, of the fact thatPrecisely not yet in circulation.It is therefore a very complex problem.Clearly, if we do not act quickly - I join the opinion of my colleague Cederschiöld on this point -, false euros can now be produced and their circulation cannot be the subject of any criminal sanction.I allow myself to point out by passing that it could be an attractive perspective for some.What is the European Union doing to deal with this possibility?A series of relevant things that our colleague Cederschiöld detailed us.Compared precisely to what has been described, the Parliament should be less lingering on the content of the framework decision and on the report written by Ms. Cederschiöld than on the currently applied procedures.Indeed, the way in which the European Parliament was consulted by the Council, which is by far the least democratic institution in Europe, insults the concept of democracy.We have received for consultation a text that the Council itself tinkered for a very long period, a text which also constitutes only a partial success - but I arrived there immediately.The European Parliament must now take a position, within three months, on this complex, difficult text and, in certain places, contradictory proposed by the Council.It is only thanks to the considerable investment of our colleague Cederschiöld and thanks to the fact that parliament has resigned itself not to make use of its democratic law, which allows it to apply its consultation procedures by having a sufficient period and all the texts translated into each language, that we can now give our opinion within the reduced time desired by the Council and to achieve this fact thatFor a subject as important as that of the protection against false coinage and the criminal harmonization that it requires, we can really not work at the hellish rhythm that advice imposes on us.This is why I want to say very clearly on behalf of my group that we discussed at length with our colleague Cederschiöld to find out if it was reasonable to work under these conditions.We came to the conclusion that it was not but that given the importance of the subject, we agree to accept such a procedure.The proposed framework decision constitutes an undoubted advance.Only the legal certainty desired by the Council - Ms. Cederschiöld has already alluded to it - will not be completely reached completely because, as regards the required minimum standards, the minimum criminal standard and, above all, the application of the same criminal standards in each Member State - even those in which the Euro has not yet been introduced, but in which it could theoretically be falsified -were not filled.	fr
Our team wants to re -control the use of the various funds and to emphasize, among other things, the better coordination of Interreg, Tacis, Ispa and Phare programs. Today this coordination is absent and the Commission has not yet submitted accurate proposals to improve coordination. We here in Parliament expect the Commission to submit to our Commission a more detailed study on the subject as soon as possible. In the process of implementation, the participation of local businesses, organizations and other bodies are crucial. Cooperation plans need better design, closer monitoring and more effective experience based on experiences. Many times there are plans in the middle and efficiency was lost in management and bureaucracy. Also, the partners must be required to commit to the plans and fulfill their own role. Our team will modify some amendments, which were rejected during the processing of the Commission. I am also referring here to the Urban Initiative report, in the explanatory memorandum of which the rapporteur processed the minimum amount of EUR 500 per capita referring to the committee's guidelines. This does not work as a mechanical target, but it should be modified according to the prevailing conditions in the area that has been set as a target. This is such an important view that it should be transferred from the explanatory exposure to the conclusions. Mr President, dear colleagues, Interreg is one of the most European in all structural funds. Here the programs are not reinforced in a single region or in one country, but in neighboring regions in two or more countries. Unfortunately, this applies only to a part of the money, that is, only to the EU internal borders. But the regions bordered by third countries are precisely those that need a functional body for cross -border cooperation. The regulation creates the wrong impression that this is really the case. The reality, however, is different and is as follows: the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, even though it has long been required by parliament. In practice, this means for the near future for these regions that the whole will be degraded again to a declining reinforcement of the border regions. Parliament has requested since 1996 the creation of a joint fund for cooperation with third countries in order to eliminate difficulties. Nothing has been done! The difficulties are again perpetuated at the expense of the affected regions. Parliament is re -seeking an improvement and a cross -border cooperation here, and we demand that a joint fund be created and the regulation be amended again in cooperation with other commissioners. We want a Europe of citizens and not a Europe of bureaucrats! Mr President, one -third of the resources of the European Union is available in various funds with various development goals. My team would absolutely agree with this practice if it helped overcome the delay of regions, cities and population groups or contributed to improving the status of public health and the environment.	el
You will find the content of this framework in the priorities of partnerships in membership, which the Commission and the Council have defined last year and which are now implemented in the corresponding planning and management of projects.Unlike this criticism, I would say that one can deplore a lack of coherence in certain areas of European policy but that, in this case, I would like to claim the fact that the Commission and the Council have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.Mr. Chairman, Mr. Chairman of the Council, after the Commissioner showed us in an extremely coherent way that the president of the council of the time and his federal minister for European affairs were responsible for the lack of coherence, you might perhaps help the commissioner and ourselves to make this decision.This would help us a lot that you are responding positively to my questions about financial prospects until 2004 and on section 7 or that, at least you declared - as the Commissioner will try to achieve it with the Commission - that the Portuguese Presidency intends to compensate for the lack of consistency of the time by such a commitment.Mr. President, I think that the question asked by my friend Mr. Elmar Brok will be examined by the Council.I think that the criticism addressed to the previous presidency is not relevant.I believe that what was done by the previous presidency in the definition of financial perspectives was an excellent job, regardless of the people who were involved in this work.In any case, the question he poses is important and we will not stop, at the level of the Council, to support the proposals that the Commission will present in this direction.Mr. Chairman of the Council, I thought I understand that our colleague Bro mentioned a still previous presidency.Mr. President, Commissioner Verheugen did not answer my question, however very concrete about the financial instrument Meda.I ask him to answer it, because his answer will determine our voting behavior on various amendments.Commission.(De) dear Mr. Poos, please apologize.There was a blur, at the precise moment when you asked your question.So, with regard to Meda, Malta and Cyprus can participate in the supraregional programs, but not national, because their income is too high.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Verheugen!The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday.Question time (Advice) Question nº 1 of (H-0022/00): Subject: Control of oil access to community waters as following the sinking of the oil tanker Erika off the French coast, which caused a dark tide, what measures does the Council intend to adopt to control access to the community waters of oil and not compliant and not respecting the community standards?Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, on January 24, the Council looked at the consequences of the sinking of the oil tanker Erika which occurred in December.	fr
The European Commission's sixth report offers very valuable conclusions.I would like to summarize two of them briefly, the rapporteur has already taken up, a positive and a negative.The first refers to the fact that significant progress in the territorial and social cohesion has been achieved throughout the Union area and that the community funds represent an important, if not decisive factor in reducing regional inequalities.The negative is that these great efforts in the alignment of GDP and the productivity of European regions showed a greater effect than when aligning their employment levels.It is therefore necessary to bind the structural financing more to the creation of jobs.That, Mr. Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period.So, Mr. President, I ask my venerated colleagues for the approval of this report and, like other colleagues in front of me, I ask the Commission to take into account the conclusions from its sixth periodic report with regard to the planning of the period 2000-2006.President!Mr. Commissioner!Dear colleagues!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the good work and the factual consideration of the proposed changes received during the treatment in the committee.The sixth periodical report is a good basis for evaluating the enforcement of regional policy goals in the Union and shows that, despite all efforts, growth only takes place unevenly.The regions of Central Europe still have a particularly fast growth, which takes place at a speed in the strong economic centers, which is above the pan -European average, while many southern European and northern regions progress considerably more slowly.Now a profound analysis on the question of why regional policy does not have the desired success in all areas.Is it due to the bureaucracy or have the differences between the regions, the large distances, very cold or hot climate, thin settlement and barren conditions have not been sufficiently taken into account?How does the Union succeed in countering the challenges of global development in such a way that the weaker -developed regions can keep up?It is also important to examine the effects of the expansion on the structural funds and the development of the areas in extreme outskirts.Here, the Member States must not escape their responsibility.Some countries have violated the principle of co -financing and shortened the national funds for the regions, while the regional aid of the Union were increased.That was at the expense of regional policy.In the future, the list of indicators must also be considered, through which measures can be organized for the right place at the right time.For example, uncontrolled migration has not been sufficiently taken into account.In this context, too, the decisive importance of small and medium -sized companies must be emphasized as an engine for employment and regional development.It is very important to introduce the most modern technology and the latest know-how in companies in regions with development residue.Our faction supports the acceptance of the present report.President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues!To date, the European Community's regional policy has not been able to significantly express the existing differences in per capita performance.	de
"This is why we had expressed our keen satisfaction with regard to decisions made on this subject during the Helsinki summit in December.An far too ambitious program would currently risk delaying the enlargement process.This is not what we want and that is why we voted against the report.However, we totally agree with our colleagues to declare that the intergovernmental conference must be transparent so that citizens can realize the evolution of our work..(SV) We are happy that a limited agenda has been set for the intergovernmental conference at the Helsinki summit.Possible future Member States must also participate in the formation of the future EU and have an influence on it.The election of the 1999 European Parliament has shown very clearly that citizens do not follow reasoning on an ever more federalist EU in the Spirit of Brussels..With the opening of the next CIG, the European Union process is again topical.Once again, the debate will be monopolized by the heads of state and government.That is to say that fifteen people will discuss and decide to camera the fate of more than 350 million individuals.We understand, therefore, the disinterest of the peoples in the face of a European construction which is done behind their backs and far from their concerns.Indeed, it is enough to look at the agenda of the CIG: institutions, enlargement and autonomous defense.In reality, it is a question of strengthening executive power, developing annexions to liberalism of the countries of the East and of reviving the militarization of Europe by increasing in particular military budgets.Social Europe, used as a storage by the EU, has disappeared out of the agenda.All this only legitimizes the development, on the scale of Europe, of resistance movements anxious to impose a social charter which would harmonize from above the main demands of workers.This is why I vote against the report.I voted for the resolution which gives a favorable opinion to the summons of the CIG because it enshrines the philosophy of the Portuguese presidency, which benefits from the support of a large majority of the Parliament, the opening of the agenda of the CIG, beyond the points strictly linked to the rebalancing of power between Member States, large and small, as originally described in the summons of the Council of Helsinki.Unfortunately, in the subjects discussed in the resolutions relating to the matters of the Treaty on the European Union which will be subject to revision, nothing indicates, to date, the need to review its article 7, which deals with the suspension of a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the ""founding"" principles of the Union, set out in article 6. As we note with the current crisis with Austria,defend.The legal mechanisms provided for by the treaties are nevertheless weak, of difficult political and legal application, they do not organize the powers of institutions and they do not guarantee jurisdictional treatment to a process of the utmost importance, namely, the conviction of a Member State to a suspension."	fr
"The hardships are starting today, as we will rule on your program today. Let me focus on my intervention on what you named in your speech before Parliament ""New Government"". You use it as a means of reconciliation with our fellow citizens. But behind the term ""new governance"" it seems to me that there is simply the issue of the functioning of the institutions, the issue of the functioning of our public authorities, if we agree that the Union must be considered a public authority. The issue of structure between the institutions of the Union, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is, of course, raised. But in this way will we reconcile citizens with European building? So we will really answer the basic questions that are not so ""who does what"" but ""what do we all do together""? Because this is exactly what is confusing to our fellow citizens. In your intervention you refer to the challenges we have to face, globalization, enlargement, and I will add to the future of our social model. That is why we insist so much in my team in this map training plan, because we believe that the inclusion of this map of fundamental rights in our work program is precisely implied by the fact that we are at a point where we come across our history and our redefinitionIn the face of the forthcoming expansions, which we want of course, but not under any circumstances. Our fellow citizens are waiting for us more Europe, but not any Europe. They are waiting for us not to adapt to globalization, but, according to our social model, to be able to organize globalization. In this respect, I must tell you that when you are committed to a political union - and support this political union - this cannot be done without this union being based on our social model, to what constitutes our particularity and our ability to better regulate this affairs of this world. Madam President, Mr. President of the Commission, Mrs Commissioner, Gentlemen, Honorable Colleagues, let me release a quote: ""The Commission will continue the preparations for the preparation of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and will submit a proposal to execute one more program. European asylum and immigration policy and argues that mutual judicial assistance and cooperation should be enhanced and an effective approach to combat all forms of crime. ""This is the overall program for the next five years in terms of internal security, freedoms, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation. This document is so short that it is equivalent to farce. Farce for the simple reason that we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino. What has been submitted to us in a written form is in a blatant contrast to what is actually existing. Such a document is not a heavenly basis for a performance table. It may have been praised and celebrated as a great achievement, but I insist that we need a basis for a performance table. We as a parliament want to deal seriously with the future development in this area of ​​politics, but on the basis of a program."	el
"Although the reform of the cohesive process closely starts from different starting points, it is necessary to want and be able to promote forward development, not the other way around. After all, this is a common issue of current and future expanded European Union, development and dignity..(SV) The common value of the Member States of the European Union is based on democracy, human rights and social market economy. These values ​​need to be reflected in the solidarity that we demonstrate in our society and the weaker groups of the rest of the world. According to the principle of proximity, the Member States themselves form their social protection system. However, citizens of the European Union must be able to enjoy the lowest social safety network, despite the country they live. The report needs ""effective and ambitious action to close taxation"" without defining its content more closely. We consider this kind of statement to be a very excessive intervention in national tax policy and therefore we cannot support it. We are therefore opposed to the report 7 of the report. We consider it positive that the report emphasizes the social dimension of cooperation at European level. However, it is important to find out which EU position will be in social protection. It is regrettable that the report lacks such a statement.. When you read the Commission's social protection communication, which is breathed by so many good intentions, the question arises whether the authors and European workers live in the same continent, in the same social reality. So I wonder if this ""common strategy for the reform of social protection"" can be a misleading design for a combined full -breasted attack on social protection and insurance and the rights achieved by workers. We agree with many rapporteur observations, but not at all with his optimism in terms of intentions and plans for the Commission and the Council. General guidelines for applicable economic policy, stabilization agreement, harsh approximation strategies that very badly harm employment and promote the concept of employability and labor market flexibility, the refraining of the Commission and the ECB of refraining from salaries and daily wages, as well as harshDoubts about the goals of the new strategy. The only goal is to smooth the way and to create the circumstances to reduce public expenditure on social security and even to be flexible for social protection itself. When, at the mouth of many authorities, social security has repeatedly been described as a cost and barrier to increasing competitiveness, and when looking for ways to transfer these costs from companies to employees - of course, at the fee of workplaces - it would be a surprise if the current model implies an unrestrained market economy and an emotional approach to everything and which is completely dependent on.the social protection and care of the fundamental rights of citizens. It is clear that the goal is to move from government -control social security systems to a private insurance system system that generates new profits for capital and further increases the burden of employees, and employees will only ""enjoy"" only for deteriorating social services. Not only is not only trying to bring unrestrained competition between public and private social security systems and Member States systems, but on the contrary, political purposes are made clear and there are unbearable pressures to reduce or dismantle social security systems for the law of the Private Sector and Victory Act. It is true that the level of employment and quality also determine the quality of social security systems. Thus, how it is possible to talk about healthy and economically sustainable social security systems, when we are faced with millions of unemployed, poor, marginalized, part-time people and the sidelines of applied work policy. Social insurance and protection is one of the most important achievements of European workers and has been achieved after a perennial battle against a perennial major capital and continuous solidarity of workers. In the current European and Underpinetry Europe, it is necessary to safeguard comprehensive social protection and expand the rights of employees, which, however, requires a different system of economic and social development. Because of its nature, the EU cannot produce it."	fi
We have to realize that the responsibility we are in that region is a responsibility that we assume together with the international community. It is a responsibility in which the European Union takes a specific role, but we could not claim that we are able to achieve the reconstruction of some infrastructure rapidly which, as the Municipality of Parliament rightly pointed out, was not the best of the military. Moreover, I am not the opinion that the military actions in Kosovo have contributed to such a significant destruction of the public health infrastructure to directly influence the creation of the prevailing situation. What is prevalent today is basically due to the dramatic situation experienced by displaced populations is due to a number of economic factors and low levels of the basic needs in the field of health, as a result of the overall disorganization of the organizational structure of the Kosovo administration. This is the main problem at the root of the whole situation today. And if we do not resolve the political problem, something that needs to be done in the context of the UN resolution, will not be able to find a solution to the health problem of infants, nor will the problems that occur in other areas of the region. I would like to extend this discussion to the situation in Mitrovica. In this city, the international community, with the cooperation of Europe, built the hospital again, but this is in the northern part of the city, with access to the hospital for Kosovo Albanians being particularly difficult. This means, therefore, that Kosovo's Albanians are still lacking in some medical care. This is also the case in other parts of the country, as there is tension between Albanians in Kosovo and Serbs and no one trusts the other, while the Albanians refuse to treat them Serbs and vice versa. I understand, indeed, what you say and it is right that the European Union should work in the direction of greater international cooperation. But where should he be given weight? What should we do so that the Albanians of Kosovo can be able to care in a hospital, including Mitrovica? Pt) Mitrovica's problem, Mr. MPs, we know it well. This is indeed a special situation, where there is a tension between ethnicities to the extent that, fortunately, it does not exist and is not as serious in other areas of Kosovo territory. I fully understand the concern expressed by the main Member. However, I would like to point out that all the actions promoted by Bernard Kouchner on this problem were moved in the context of the spirit resulting from the United Nations resolution, in an effort to formulate terms to create multicatomatic structures that will be able to, even at the level of different sectors. I think that in this regard, we should not be induced into hasty judgments about these responsibilities, because they are shared among various protagonists. The situation in Mitrovica is sad, this is a situation where a special tension occurs, and I believe that the measures taken during the last few hours to ensure security conditions in that area are positive. I would like to point out that we do not have - and we are sorry for that - responsibilities on police forces - which is due to the contributions of the Member States - to achieve the ones we intended to do in the context of the activities that followed the military operations.their access to hospital facilities.	el
As an example, I take the Mediterranean and Fisheries in my country. Years after the Mediterranean UKP's actions were limited to commercialization and corporate assistance regulations, Regulation 1626 finally put a responsible fishing policy that involves measures protecting the endangered fishing resources to ensure the use of the funds. This is a goal that can be agreed, but which, during its implementation, has sometimes caused the lively specific properties of the Mediterranean fish have been refused to identify. The following setting, No. 1448, which was not by chance in 1999 made certain exceptions, especially for so -called special fish. This deferry will soon be over, exactly 31 May, and the Commission must submit a new proposal. We hope that the proposal to be presented takes into account that this fishing system is vital to large sea areas in Italy and that there is a certain kind of sustainability for environmental impacts collected so far. Much thanks, Mr Fischler, a member of the Commission. The discussion has ended. The vote will be made tomorrow at 11am. The combat of certain fish diseases on the agenda is the following by the proposal of the Fisheries Committee (A5-0036/2000) by the Hudhhton Fisheries Committee (A5-0036/2000) about the Council Directive on the amendment of the Council Directive 93/53/EEC in order to combat certain fishery diseases. Salmon infectious Anemia (ISA) is a contagious viral disease that was first found in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986, and for the first time it was found in the European Union in May 1998 in Scotland. Although the virus has been found in other fish species, the disease itself has only occurred in salmon. The virus is known to be destroyed at temperatures above 25 degrees Celsius, and there is therefore a consensus among scientists that there is simply cannot survive the virus to the human being in even heat. In the European Union, it is the most salmon cultivation industry in Scotland and has spread to the most remote areas of Europe. It depends on 6,500 jobs and generates approximately EUR 800 million annually. Therefore, it is obvious that this topic is very important to Scotland, but it is vital for Europe to control and dispose of the disease if possible. The current directive prevents the use of vaccines and requires the slaughter of all fish in the educators where the disease occurs, the fish were ill or not. When adopting the current order, the aim was to eradicate ISA and make it as quickly as possible. In fact, compulsory slaughter policy has failed to prevent the reproduction of ISA, not to mention the eradication of the disease, and the current provision has had a devastating economic impact on the fisheries sector, as it has not been paid and commercial insurance can be obtained. The proposed changes are dual -divided: the first change can use vaccination as a weapon in this battle. This is a necessary change, and in addition, in Europe, it should be committed to encouraging and funding research to develop an effective vaccine. Another proposed change would allow the gradual removal of fish from the educators where the disease has occurred, according to a plan based on the severity of the problem detected by each educational plant. This approach has been implemented quite efficiently in Norway, where new new ISA cases have only been reduced to a few cases a year, whereas in the early 1990s, 8090 cases were found every year. That is why I support the changes proposed by the Commission and appeal to their urgent implementation and enforcement. I also emphasize the issue of compensation, and I appeal to the Council's decision 90/424/EEC to be revised so that the ISA, in particular, is included in the list of illnesses attached to the decision, which will pay half of the compensation and the other half of the Member State. I would like to thank the colleagues sitting in the Fisheries Committee for voting by far my report, and thank my Scottish colleagues, especially in the committee for their entire contribution to this process.	fi
Now that you, Mr. Prodi, and your predecessors have deprived citizens of their right to self -determination, the quality of the work carried out in Brussels must improve significantly and that these works take place in full transparency so that citizens have at least the impression of being heard.I would just like to make a remark about what M. Dell'alba said about the dream of the founding fathers: so read the Memoirs of Jean Monnet.His dream was to create what he called a small practical secretariat.It is certainly not this small secretariat that Mr. Prodi is now president.The president, this morning, this morning, the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, explained the ambitious objectives of the European Union for the next five years, of the laudable objectives, in fact, to ensure a strong and effective European presence in the world: to ensure the success of the enlargement, to take up the challenge of selling electronic Europe, to introduce better principles of governance.We design that Europeans, especially the new generation, need to be given a broad view of the situation that Europe will occupy in the years to come.But, how can we succeed when the available resources are limited and when the credibility of our institutions is started?We must match this project to reality.On this point, there are three elements that I would like to exhibit.First of all, we need a flourishing European economy.We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to drop everywhere in Europe, consolidate the tendency to privatization and deregulation, encourage the introduction of information and knowledge technology of the Internet, show that electronic Europe is a favorable initiative.However, we must avoid falling back into the crossing of the regulation at the old fashion, which stifles the initiatives and the spirit of individual enterprises.We must not fear globalization, but we must make sure that we understand its political impact within the Society of Networks.Without a flourishing European economy, we will not be able to meet the challenges that await us, and more particularly the challenge of enlargement.Then, we must take care to legislate only if necessary - in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity.Do less, but better - a central point of the last commission - must also become the objective of this Commission.We will examine this point in detail when we pass the annual legislation proposals to annual programs.Mr. Bonde rightly said that there is this image of doing less but better and then, suddenly, we note that the annual program for the year 2000 has 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to indicate a completely different direction.We must establish priorities and ensure that money is used wisely in each of these programs.Finally, we must make sure that the European Commission will be reformed adequately, true.Yes, the commission - guardian of the treaties - is supposed to be an independent body, but it must also account for European citizens through our parliament.The problem of information, to which M. Bonde has just referred, is treated as if it was a simple possibility, the commission giving the appearance of restricting the information to which, as citizens and as parliamentarians, we are entitled under the treaties.	fr
So there is still much to happen in this matter. So what still has to happen? There are two more things to happen, and the Theato report says it clearly and well. First, all Member States of the European Union must have the same provisions on punishment. Thus, harmonization is needed in this limited area. Secondly, the European Prosecutor's Prosecutor's Office, which has two tasks, must indeed be established: first, to assist the national prosecutors in community -level fraud and, secondly, to monitor the legality of Europol and Olaf's activities, as these two investigative agencies can currently operate without enforcement of legality. The European Prosecutor's Office does not have to be afraid despite all the threats here. It's a very positive thing, just like Europol. Europol, police cooperation, is not above the national police system, but is intended to exchange information between police. It is the same thing that the small and limited European Prosecutor's Office begins, but not during the investigation, but during the trial phase. Parliament is in favor of this, as well as the Committee on Experts. I also ask the Ministry Council and the European Commission to accept this measure myself. Mr President, I want to focus on the question about Corpus Jur. I greatly support what Parliament Morgan said on this question. Corpus Jjuris was created without any public debate or public participation. The general European prosecutor based on continental European inquisitive model, which would have a primary jurisdiction in the EU, would have a significant impact on the traditional systems of Ireland and the United Kingdom. The unified criminal law and the general prosecutor of Europe are issues that Member States have the right to know. In fact, when the plan was originally drafted, it was said that it would be limited to fraud against the EU budget. When Corpus Juris was released in 1997 in San Sebastian-140 to a carefully selected lawyer, and no media representative-the then President of the European Parliament Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado said he was just beginning and intended to extend the jurisdiction of the EU to all criminal activities. This must be made on a public debate. Member States and their citizens must obtain appropriate information. The threat to the traditional legal systems of Ireland and the United Kingdom must be considered. This issue needs to be dealt with much more openly than until now. It cannot be accepted that such a matter has been pushed to EU Member States without proper public debate. Mr President, good colleagues, on behalf of radical members, I tell you that I was arrested in the Committee on Committee on the Committee on the Committee on the Committee on Voting for this text, as I agree with the concerns that are certainly important, that is, a representative of the Common Law culture so precisely. With this text, we have undoubtedly gone to excess, as we consider that some factors need to be solved, and it is important that the fraud of the community be suppressed and brought into the work. However, the way in which our committee intends to enforce this text with the enthusiasm and unprecedented desire of President Theato, also gives rise to criticism. In the text, another topic of criticism applies to the derived right. Pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, the Council is authorized to find the right tools to combat fraud. However, we are somewhat disbelieving in the fact that an advanced institution could arise on the basis that certain negative effects are not taken into account, that is, I mean that the need for defense would be neglected and to complicate the effective functioning of the prosecutor and defense in such a significant sector of the legal system. We wanted to show this disbelief by being arrested in the committee for voting. Mr President, I believe it would be necessary to consider this topic specifically in the European Parliament, both in plenary and in committees, although it is clear that the debate cannot be excluded from the issues concerning the culture, the legal culture and the links in which these institutions are dealt with. We now have to grasp quite serious cases that in the past seem to have been a common way.	fi
For example, applying the Equal initiative to the goals of employment and work flexibility to transform the initiative into a new version of local employment agreements. The risk of extending the Leader initiative to all union regions is the risk that the unfavorable areas will marginalize even further, and the advanced areas will benefit. When choosing the subsidy areas of the Interreg initiative, the border, archipelago and mountain areas, such as the Greek Arta Province, which unfortunately have been excluded beyond Annex I to the Commission Communication, must be emphasized. Mr President, Parliament and the Commission have named the rural development as a priority, and would like to welcome the corresponding Commission member Fischler here today. Our retaliation to prevent rural decay will be late, but I assume that better late than never. Today, it is awarded that family farms are central to the European agricultural model, and this objective must be taken into account, of course, according to the schedule of Agenda 2000. My view is that the next five years are crucial for the future of thousands of poorly profitable family farms. We all have to do our best to ensure their vitality. As a member of the Commission knows, agriculture alone is not enough to ensure the sustainable development of rural areas. For this reason, we need all policy coordination to have a positive impact on the development of rural areas. In this sense, Leader defends its position as an effective development initiative. It gives local communities the opportunity to find their inexpensive development opportunities and actively get involved in solving related problems. People's voluntary participation in development programs has not always been fully appreciated. However, there is no doubt that the Leader initiative would be effective if it is taken into an integral part of EU policy and national policy in a broader sense. Although I am pleased that the Commission approved the Leader+program, I would finally say that I was worried about the time delay that will be left out between the end of the Leader II program and the start of the new program. I ask you to take seriously about this problem. There are serious consequences of interruption to the program and will certainly have a devastating effect on volunteers and professionals. Mr President, Dear Member of the Commission, Good Members of the Parliament, after familiarizing with the Commission Communication on Interreg III initiative and reminded that I participated in the Decourrière report in the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee, I want to repeat clearly. The Commission has approved measures to promote the revitalization of decayed regions as a result of agricultural prices, and in my country many associations, especially hunting associations, are already vigorously focused on this area. I also want to announce that I strongly support the comments of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee, especially and especially those who regret the exclusion of particularly remote areas of the program section A or where the inaccuracy of the criteria for the selection of activities contained in III C, and finally, which are requested by members of the parliamentary.the operation of the monitoring center. In addition, I would like to say that I am very cautious about the orientation that is related to the Commission Communication of Interreg III areas and areas III B, and the environmental protection is linked solely to the development of the Natura 2000 program, which I think has always been too abstract to protect the ecosystems whose utilization is in danger. Finally, I would like to ask for an understanding of the Commission and the relevant councils in advance and to emphasize that Parliament members should be more informed of the implementation procedures for interregal and similar initiatives. It would be even better if they were allowed to participate more in the processing and implementation processes of these programs, otherwise it is difficult to define and defend their position among local communities, national authorities and even citizens. Mr Mr President, Mr Presidents, is an undeniable fact that the Interreg initiative supports the endeavor to economic and social cohesion in the European Union.	fi
I not only did this because I was born in a city by the sea, namely Genoa, but above all because the borders of the regions washed by the sea are just limited.These limits open the gate to the African states and the Middle East: We have to consider more that it is important to develop the coastal regions all over Europe.As a member of the MEP of a border region, this third Interreg initiative is of particular interest to me.One cannot indicate the difficulties that occurred in the past in the economically, socially and culturally separate border regions on the coasts and inland.Due to the presence of the border, they became marginal zones of their respective states, which often caused the government agencies to neglect these regions as part of national politics.Therefore, the Interreg community initiative was launched in 1990.It pursues the goal of promoting the cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation as well as a balanced development of the common space in order to strengthen the Union's economic and social cohesion.Via Interreg, joint projects in the areas of SME funding, professional and general education, cultural exchange, healthcare, protection and improvement in the environment as well as energy, transport and telecommunications networks are financed.I would particularly like to emphasize that interregional cooperation contributes to involving the local and regional local authorities in the European integration process.In fact, it is important to promote a more active participation of local and regional authorities in the community initiatives, since the local and regional local authorities often only have very limited cooperation opportunities due to the differences in the legal framework and in the level of development on both sides of the border.As part of the cooperation in the border area close to the border, the improvement of the framework conditions for the workplace -buying medium -sized companies must apply special attention.Likewise, given the fact that 50 % of unemployment, the funds provided by Interreg are structurally due to the fact that they are so extensive that they are so extensive that they are sensibly complement the national measures to promote employment.In concrete terms, cross -border mobility is too often prevented, made more difficult or particularly problematic by obstacles in connection with tax policy (double taxation) and social security.My wish is that the projects within the framework of the individual programs contribute to finding solutions to these problems and the principle of free movement of the employees, with whom it is not particularly good in my region, to give a concrete content.Furthermore, the Interreg funds must also contribute to the formation of a European research area.And last but not least, there are also great expectations of this initiative in the regions, since the places that are not eligible under goal 2 hope from Interreg!So it is about a lot, because the integration of the border regions is an important element for the development of a future European spatial planning policy!It remains to be hoped that this is as aware of this as F. Decourrière, which I would like to congratulate.The Interreg Community Initiative is part of a harmful European regional policy.However, this policy, which is generously, since it is officially intended to support the regions in difficulties, is a bad business for French taxpayers, because France contributes 17 % to the European budget, but only receives 8 % of regional structural funds.	de
"(The session is lifted at 00:05) Wallowing the Erika The agenda calls for the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Fisheries Commission, to the Commission on the shipwreck of Erika.Mr. President, the Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I would first like to greet the consideration that Mr. Fischler had to be today among us.Yesterday, our president had announced to us that he was going to be absent because of his agenda.But I believe that he thought and that he did what he is used to doing: having consideration and respect for this Parliament, as he has always been able to demonstrate, and I thank him.I’m raising the voice today in this hemicycle, on behalf of the European Parliament Fisheries Commission, in order to focus our concerns again on the sinking of the oil tanker Erika.A double political consideration leads our committee - as well as myself, as president of this commission - to raise their voice in this case.First of all to demonstrate to the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this Parliament cannot or want to forget this serious accident.And then to focus today on a concrete aspect of the serious environmental disaster caused by this accident, namely its impact on the fishing and aquiculture sectors of the affected regions.The epilogue of this accident must undoubtedly be the urgent adoption of measures to repair damage and to avoid that such a disaster will not happen again in the future.No more lamentations and reflections.We must all, Mr. President, go straight to the goal and adopt measures.First, safety in maritime transport - especially when it comes to transporting hydrocarbons and dangerous goods - requires effective controls in community waters and its ports.Questions such as the construction of ships, the double hull, its age, the control of classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases including all the necessary information, cooperation and community coordination, reinforcement of inspectors' control, responsibility for cargo cargo and owners must be addressed and in this regard, the Commission is best placed toMaterials.Transport ensured by the pavilions of complacency - which also do so wrong to fishing that we have called for ""responsible fishing"" must also be subject to specific surveillance and regulations.The entry into community waters of ships with complacency pavilions must be controlled in community waters that do not meet community security standards.We are waiting for the Commission to take concrete measures.With regard to the fishing and aquiculture sector - which are particularly important, developed and prestigious in the affected areas of Brittany and Vendée - the European Commission must promote the damage caused, the evaluation of the latter and the specific measures of any type that it thinks of adopting - political, economic, social, financial measures, etc.To repair the damage caused to fishermen and industries that were seriously affected overnight.How will we be able to recover the confidence of consumers with regard to products from this region?What will be the compensations for the victims?We are faced with a very serious problem that the European Union - economic, commercial, industrial, and fishing power can afford to leave without a solution.Mr. Commissioner, you have to work.We must be pioneers and avant-garde in questions of destruction of the environment, industries and professional activities."	fr
"I can only rejoice at such an initiative! Unemployment, poverty and the resulting social exclusion are the plagues we have to eradicate! Therefore, it is essential to create a consistent and above all coordinated strategy in all Member States! First of all, we have to set our ambitious goals for ourselves. The Portuguese document of the Presidential State lists the following goals: restoring full employment, stable economic growth, a real aspiration for social cohesion, equal opportunities, and combating poverty. As Guterres, Chairman of the Council emphasized, we have been able to reconcile our economic policy to ensure the euro. The European Union now has to meet the challenge and proceed accordingly by suggesting guidelines for policy promoting employment and social inclusion! I am also pleased with the idea of ​​setting quantitative goals and figures that are pursued, in particular in the EU's average annual growth (3 %) and the employment rate (70 %). In addition, in my opinion, an open comparison analysis must be introduced to evaluate the development of the Member States as they strive for these goals through an open peer review system and coordination. The Presidential State document also emphasizes the need to strengthen social approaches and the modernization of our social security systems. Of course, the absolute prerequisite is to guarantee a high level of employment. It requires job creation, especially in the service industry, but not for any jobs, but for quality jobs. It also requires storage of jobs in Europe, where recently there have been many systematic mass transparency recipients. It requires labor training to manage new information technology. So I largely accept this program. I hope that its goals will be created at the Lisbon Summit ambitious practical measures that meet the eligible expectations of European citizens, both men and women! . (EL) Once again, the Summit, this time under the leadership of the Presidential State Portugal, increases the contribution and strengthening and strengthening of employment -supporting measures and proposals, and the ""promotion"" of unemployment, in the acceleration and strengthening of their neoliberal and monetary policies that are responsible for the current situation of social policies and employment policies.dramatic increase in insecurity, discrimination, social exclusion and the proliferation of poverty. The proposal manages unemployment by supporting companies' competitiveness by reducing labor costs, full release and labor market flexibility, and supporting atypical forms of employment is contradictory, it is irony, hypocrisy, provocation towards employees. Maintaining and reinforcing the stabilization agreement, priority and full subjugation of social policy to the economic criteria and demands are exactly what should first be struck and overturned if we want to talk about real employment policy. Taxation of capital movements for speculation, the closure of tax havens, the fight against deception and tax evasion, the redistribution of wealth and earnings, the monitoring of business subsidies, and the immediate interruption of the transmission of transfers, fusion and relief of the transfers, based on social security based on the commercialImmediate priority if employment was indeed the center of the EU's attention, and not how to sugare a bitter pill in order to cheat workers and limit social reactions against non-working and anti-national economic and social policy. If the goal was to improve the living population, increase its purchasing power and secure permanent jobs, support public and social investment, equality and reject any discrimination related to getting jobs and employment relationships, the closure of policies based on privatization, low-wage and lack of social security,permanently excluded from the labor market for disabled people. However, what is being promoted by the guidelines of economic and social policy is what is practically pursued by employees is the minimum level of poverty and not. Well-being is aimed at large capital, which will be opened to the fields of honor and remains more and more controlled, while in the name of productivity and competitiveness, the regulation of labor markets is increasingly dismantled, the most important achievements and social rights of the employees are being attacked more and more violently and the view that"	fi
"This is a big challenge, the big importance of Lisbon. I want to deal with a little more closely the key aspects that we understand that objective of transition from jewelry to deeds. First of all, we need to commit to the true model analysis, the true peer review process, to set real achievement goals, that the governments boldly say, ""Yes, we can be compared to each other, we can be compared to the rest of the world.""It's a really bold decision because some Member States will surely find themselves at the end of the league standings, which of course nobody likes. However, this is important if we want to get real results from the Lisbon Summit, rather than passing the other way - a way that Prime Minister Guterres does not want to go because he wants something to do at the Lisbon Summit. We need to look at other areas. One challenge is to create Eeurope, where all citizens are involved and no one is left out. Another challenge is the process that we have a real cohesive market that we still do not have, and skills that are necessary for the creation of an innovative and knowledge -based society. There are difficult choices ahead of us, but I would like to have this discussion for people who listen to this evening that we can really create a full employment society that the road leading to Lisbon is the head of our journey and that it will produce concrete results. I am positive about the new strategic goal of making Europe a very dynamic and competitive area. Who could question such an ambition? However, I have to say that dynamism and entrepreneurship and social cohesion are very ambitious goals, not to mention the creative tension between the two goals. I hope we reach them, but I say the word of the warning. I note the other ambitious goal of having a proactive role in arranging cybera space. I can't help but think that we are on the trains rather! I am positive about the emphasis on the promotion of research and development in Europe, the development of content production and the acceleration of broadband networks as part of the transition to the information society. In fact, I would rather call it an information economy because its financial side is the most important. We live an era of internet and digital technology. This is what we strive to achieve in the electronic area of ​​life. However, I find it positive that this summit also aims to emphasize the broader emphasis on reforming European economies to improve competition and innovation. It's definitely right. We cannot only focus on the new economy. We also need to pay attention to the old economy. I am eagerly awaiting more detailed information about the European Charter of Micro Businesses - it is probably very interesting as long as one is achieved. One of the priorities defined in the Cardiff's process is to better understand the value of intangible investments and investments in the financial markets. This has probably happened better than a few months ago. It can be seen that the value of "".com"" companies has phenomenally increased on the European Stock Exchange and that there have recently been significant changes in the composition of the London FTSE 100 index. However, I cannot help but think that even though these values ​​have risen in the clouds and the bubble may soon burst, the underlying structural change in our background has come to stay anyway. Mr President of the Council, you brought a close atmosphere with the European Parliament. We can all only hope that an extraordinary summit can also be able to live up to the high expectations for it. As just as you already stressed, we no longer need policies after each other, procedures after the procedures, but rather we need acts that residents of the European Union are able to measure the benefits of the European Union and the added value it produces."	fi
They also answered them as I knew they would answer them.I would like to link it to something that Mr. Goodwill asked, namely with our relationship between the precautionary principle and the world outside the European Union.I don't ask that without reason.You rightly said that the precautionary principle is necessary if science has no evidence.How do we make sure that we don't make ourselves more vulnerable, for example with our partners in the USA - and the organic safety protocol is not enough?How do we ensure that the men's colleagues do not always go away their legs from their predecessors like the last few times?That is exactly what it is about, otherwise we don't need to talk about the precautionary principle, Ms. Commissioner!President!I think it is very important to refer to the guidelines contained in this communication that apply to the use of the precautionary principle in order to ward off claims that we would always apply it for protectionist reasons.I am convinced that we will have more conflicts, for example with the USA, in the future.It would be naive to believe something else.Since the signing of the Montreal protocol, however, we have had international confirmation and a joint definition stipulated in a protocol on the environment, health and trade.This can therefore be seen as a good example.We have to make ourselves so that there will continue to be conflicts in the future, but now we can prove that we do not apply the precautionary principle arbitrarily.We now have a series of guidelines that are clearly defined in the communication and a strong backing among the population.Thank you very much, Ms. Commissioner.Due to the attention that is shown to the principle of political provision, we have discussed almost two hours about it, and now this topic is considered, so to speak, as more of an ongoing administration, although, as we could see from the speeches and answers, the subject is important.The pronunciation is closed.Government conference on the agenda follows the report (A5-0018/2000) by Giorgos Dimitrakopoulos and Jo Leinen on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Questions about the convene of the government conference (14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825 (CNS))).Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank the Portuguese Council Presidency and the Commission for the numerous extremely useful contacts recently.My further thanks also go to my co -ray store, Mr. Leinen, to the excellent cooperation.The upcoming government conference is important both in general and especially with regard to the upcoming expansion.It depends on the consultations there on how Europe will be structured in the 21st century and how it will work.In order to make the processes in the future European Union more efficient, democratic and transparent in every respect, understandably a comprehensive and profound reform of its institutions is required.The first and most important prerequisite for the success of this reform is the agenda, on the basis of which the government conference will start work.The agenda agreed on the summit in Helsinki is not sufficient and offers no guarantee that the necessary and fundamental changes are made for the creation of a more functional, more efficient, more democratic and more transparent Europe.	de
"In turn, the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, will take initiatives to initiate and enrich this public debate.Cross -border services Mr. President, Dear Commissioner, esteemed colleagues!First of all, I have to apologize that my voice is already a little attacked today, but as an Austrian MP, there has been a lot to explain and talk today.First of all, I would like to thank the Commission very much for the initiative that she took, and for these two guidelines that we discuss here today.It closes two serious gaps in the internal market, which are of great importance for the European economy and 5 million third -state citizens in the European Union, which are here as an employee or as self -employed.The current situation, and that should be called again, is in such a way that there are judgments of the European Court of Justice in the area of ​​employees, in particular the judgment in Rush Portuguesa and van der Elst.They have made it clear that freedom of service must allow third -country citizens to use as an employee for cross -border services and to be able to do so without obtaining work permits.However, the question of visa and residence conditions was not explicitly addressed by the European Court of Justice, and the Member States could not clarify this question as a result.But also with regard to the elimination of the work permit, not all Member States have adhered to the knowledge of the court and today still maintain a large number of inadmissible barriers for cross -border services, barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for smaller companies.In the case of the self -employed, the situation is in such a way that the current community legal level does not provide for third -country national citizens to provide cross -border services.In any case, you need a legislative act here. Both guideline designs aim to facilitate the freedom of service from EU companies.It is not about original rights for third -country countries that are reproduced to freedom of movement.All regulations that enter and residence law questions can be seen as accessory to this freedom of service.I and with me the committee for law and internal market of the European Parliament are therefore of the opinion that the legal bases elected by the Commission are the right one and that the counter -opinion represented in the report of the legal service of the Council is inaccurate.I therefore do not see a real legal obstacle that both guidelines are treated quickly in the council.I also think that the changes proposed by the parliament should facilitate the acceptance of the guidelines in the Council to the Commission proposal.Many of our changes go back to concerns that have also been expressed in the council, and we try to reconcile these concerns with the mandate, the law and economic reason that will be applicable to us.Especially with regard to acceptance in the Council, I can only appeal to the Commission to adopt the changes adopted by the parliament as completely as possible, even if they deviate far from the original commission proposals.I am firmly convinced that on this basis we can easily find unity in the council.Now to the most important changes we propose.A major difference is that instead of a system ""Service ID plus display of each individual order"" we no longer provide a possibility that the prior notice to the reception state can be requested for each individual order."	de
"Regarding the question asked about Austria, I will repeat what I said earlier regarding Austria's compliance, so far, to Articles 6 and 7. I was glad to hear the main MP using the expression ""ad hoc""government. There was no question of the behavior of the government, but its composition, the political formations involved in it. In some previous discussion I had pointed out that today we are all in the European Union today. And I stress it again. We are all Austrians because the union space is uniform in terms of rights, in terms of citizenship. And what I want is to enjoy in Austria the same rights that Austrian citizens should enjoy in my own country. Consequently, I do not like to rule a party whose behavior is racist and xenophobic and makes similar statements, phenomena in which it is legitimate to express some concerns. The expression of these concerns receives a bilateral political dimension at the moment and does not move at the level of European Union, as no decision will be taken at this level except in the event of a violation of the provisions of Articles 6 and 7 of the Amsterdam Treaty. So, Mr. MPs, what we have to appreciate in the future is whether FPF's behavior is distanced from the ideological standards that have marked his past, because it is here an element of fundamental importance. It is important to clarify the FPF if it remains committed to the principles that have inspired the style of its earlier proclamations, and in particular if it remains bound by the personalities that have made similar declarations, because otherwise I see no other way out of the rest of the same states.stop. And as I mentioned before, this applies exclusively to a bilateral level. The Austrians have every right to choose the government they want. But we too, in turn, have every right to maintain our opinion on the Austrian government. Honorable Mr. Chairman of the Council, you have said that a party has taken power in Austria that has publicly made racist comments. Here in us, in the European Parliament, people are talking and not the parties. So your answer to Mr Dupuis's question now refers that the sanctions adopted jointly by fourteen Heads of State and Government are bilateral. So is it possible to lift sanctions bilaterally, in other words can a single Member State decide to lift sanctions and restore the usual relationships? If this is really the case, when will the Council officially liberate Austrian citizens from this martyrdom of their democratic rights violations? Should any Member State be individually lifted before the Council is rationalized and abolished this decision? The Major MP should not have heard what I said, or maybe there was a mistake in the interpretation."	el
"But tomorrow it will be very late. It is time today to clarify the rules of the game before we all get lost. With the approval of the Water Directive on Wednesday, February 16, the European Parliament confirms its ambition to protect surface waters, swimming water, inner waters and groundwater. Europe now has a framework that allows for the prevention of any water quality degradation, promoting its sustainable use, protecting ecosystems, contributing to the fight against floods and droughts and ceasing disruption of dangerous substances. It's like throwing a lifeboat to save water. I welcome this ambitious proposal of water framework directive. Indeed, the ecological disaster that plagues the banks of the Danube reminds us, though it probably does not need a reminder, that very often human negligence endangers natural resources, such as water. The purpose of this proposal for a directive, dating back to 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation that has so far characterized water legislation and to protect surface waters, swimming waters, inner waters and groundwater. It provides a framework that allows for any additional degradation, the protection of ecosystems, the promotion of a sustainable use of water, the contribution to the fight against floods and droughts and the gradual cessation of hazardous substances. Special instructions will then be approved within this context. The process of preparing this text has been long. The Directive proposal was amended twice, the first in 1997 and the second in 1998. A technical working group consisting of council representatives and parliament met in January 1999 in an attempt to approach the positions of the two institutions. However, the amendments tabled by the Environment Committee are still many. I support most. Concerning the timetable and objectives, the Council provides that the objective of achieving a good condition of surface waters must be implemented at the latest 16 years after the position of the Directive, while the Committee for the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wishes that this deadline will be reduced to 10 years. The Commission also calls for an end to all discharges or leaks of hazardous substances by 2020. The ultimate goal must consist of achieving levels near zero by 2020. The Council hopes to achieve groundwater good condition after the expiry of 16 years,groundwater in order to achieve the level of good condition of groundwater within ten years. All specifications and all objectives on protected areas must be implemented within 10 years and not 16. I must say that I am in favor of these shortcuts, provided that there are exceptions. As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal that by which, by 2010, Member States should ensure that policies for determining water price can motivate a more reasonable use of water resources. In the same context, I expect from the European Commission to make a clear statement that it will commit to presenting a proposal attempting to ensure that prices for the use of water will reflect environmental costs and costs for resources by 2012. A commercial product, like all else, is a legacy that belongs to the peoples of the European Union, and must be protected and provided with appropriate treatment as such. """	el
We consider it necessary and urgent, and we hope that its results will really make it possible to expand the European Union in due course. Mr President of the Council, my team has satisfied that the Council presidency is not happy with the current situation. For this reason, let me assure you that the European Union Left - Left of the Greens of the Northern Countries will also be zealous so that the European Union can finally perform its duties. It is neither more nor much about the future of Europe and above all Europe that its citizens will perceive it as their own Europe, because they will format it and because politics will take seriously their concerns and their needs, problems and issues that really touch them. The policy of the doors, the consultations without the presence of third parties, all of this must belong to the past. For this reason transparency is necessary. I believe that you, as the presidency of the Council, have to ensure that the train does not proceed as it has progressed so far and not leave citizens at the station as if they were illiterate in terms of conditions. We not only consider the wider information of citizens about the course and the results of the intergovernmental conference, but much more their direct participation in the overall reform process. We also believe that responsible bodies for political decisions must finally overcome their self -restraint and after completing the intergovernmental conference to ask citizens with referendums if they agree on how Europe will evolve in the future. So we would really have a Europe of citizens and indeed a completely new quality of democratic legitimacy of the Union. I want to clearly refer to another central issue concerning democracy. As a member of the team for the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which has begun its work, I want to say clearly: My team and I personally consider that a festive announcement is not enough for the map. What will citizens say when they are solemnly announced their rights, while they cannot claim them at an individual level? I believe that this would further exacerbate the crisis that the Union is going through in its credibility. Low participation in the European elections should be quite a strong risk signal for everyone. What we need is visible rights for every citizen. The map of fundamental rights must be legally binding for all people living in the European Union, for all European citizens. We must work together to achieve this goal for the benefit of the citizens and I am waiting for the intergovernmental conference that the Cologne decision will be revised by the end of the year. It is, of course, the efficiency of decisions and the proper functioning of the institutions in a union of 27 and more Member States. This is impossible to achieve with a microfinance, such as the one planned by the Council, and therefore the institutions should be under consideration.	el
"In this context, Europe as a whole, and in particular every Member State, should make the best use of all its resources and potential, and therefore the available structural funds. To do this, a European Commission is needed which, in addition to good intentions, must make its guidelines clearer and commit to the greater extent possible to a project to control the use of these resources by the Member States. Italy, for example, in recent years has had problems with the use of the resources of structural funds, in particular because of excessive bureaucracy, inadequate information and small participation of economics and social actors locally. So there are two issues that I would like to draw the committee's attention: First, the consultation as a method of coordinating and participating in decisions on all local and regional bodies must be fully utilized, precisely to avoid inequalities and inequalities,Complex, to the point that they make access to the resources of the Funds, which mainly protest European small and medium -sized enterprises. And conclude, Mr President, saying that it is quite serious that the Commission's announcement pays little attention to territorial agreements and, in particular, to the methods of combating women's unemployment and young people. Mr President, like my colleague Mr. Evans, it is particularly pleasant to get up and give my first speech to this body about this very important issue, especially if I represent a part of the United Kingdom, West Midlands, which have so far benefited from now, which has been a great deal of funding. The way in which, if we are not very careful, we can produce ideas that sound very grandiose, but lacking the substance that will make them relative to people who benefit directly from them. This exhibition itself has good intentions, however, as is often the case when dealing with these issues, there is a lack of a clear goal and a solid functionality. For this reason, I and my team propose three key amendments and additions to the text, not to remove something from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those who seek to guide. I would like to explain our reasoning in this case. First, we are interested in the proper use of the resources of structural funds and the cohesion fund. Previous experiences dictate that, as an elected representatives of the European Taxpayer, we must, in fact, require economic integrity and transparency in the expense and control of these funds. Therefore, our amendments and additions are related to the achievement of these indicators known as ""Resource Optimization"" indicators during the process of granting the aid. Then, very often we see huge sums of money spent on plans whose results will necessarily be unclear at the start of the program period. However, in the middle or end of this period there is no effective way of stopping the plan if it turns out unsuccessful."	el
I get scared and worried, because therefore, at least partially, the social exclusion stirs.It is not clear to me how you want to show solutions with such considerations.My question, which I repeat again here, is: What is the Portuguese presidency on the demands that, for example, make the networks to combat poverty and social exclusion, i.e. separation of work and social security, application of tax policy, especially to speculative financial capital, as well as a policy for redistribution of income?So I ask you to tell me what attitude the Portuguese presidency represents and whether it intends something in this direction.MP, they have to understand that the real possibilities of a presidency to reverse global social or economic tendencies in the six months of their work are effectively limited.It is probably completely clear that we are also very closely bound by the logic, which is based on the intervention of the Commission itself through its right to initiative.I spoke of the special summit of the European Council and the initiative that Portugal had to carry out, and I also talked about the future because there are two complementary approaches for this problem of social exclusion: One is the overall complex of direct measures that must be taken to counteract their concrete consequences, the other is the creation of the prerequisites for competitive ability on an international level thatTo perfect the economic structure within the European Union, which is associated with a positive effect on the problems of social exclusion.And that's why the Portuguese presidency has no patent recipes to answer questions in six months that have always existed.It is ready to act on all questions based on the Commission's proposals in these areas that fall into the responsibility of the community.Of course, she is able to promote all measures that are proposed, in particular on the part of the non -governmental organizations, but also within the framework of conventional intergovernmental cooperation in these areas.However, one has to consider, Mr MP, that it is not possible to work in an area with financially only serious effects with measures that can propose a presidency in a six -month period.That is why we keep all measures that we have pointed out in connection with long -term strategies - although we also know that some homeless people may have died after a long time, this is true - for measures with which sustainable policies can be guaranteed as part of the European Union.And we will try to contribute to these strategies as best we can during our term.Inquiry No. 12 of (H-0801/99): concerns: Portuguese chairmanship and development policy, can the acting president of the council present the priorities of the Portuguese chair in relation to development policy, the agreement of Lomé and the procedure for famines?I would like to thank the President of the Council for his detailed answer to my question and also express my position to the minister, who explained his position in Brussels last week in Brussels before the Development and Cooperation Committee.Nevertheless, not all questions have yet been clarified.In the present program, the fight against AIDS does not seem to be given a special priority.	de
I consider our duty as politicians to the victims of the ever -expanding organized crime to create the Council, the Commission and the Parliament the means necessary for its effective fight. Mr President, in Italy, the smuggling of cigarettes had been a long time, especially after the war thanks to the films of neo -realism, an almost romantic aura. What is happening in Puglia and southern Italy, but there is nothing romantic, on the contrary. The tragic death of the two men of the Financial Crimes Prosecution Police is not only a public security problem in Italy but it is a European problem: it is not a European security problem, but mainly a problem that concerns our relationships with neighbors on the other side of the Adriatic. The European Union is essentially involved in the reconstruction of the former Yugoslavia. The actions of the local authorities and our mobilization to help them in their actions are completely decisive for the crash of criminal organizations and therefore for the safety of Europeans. In this context, we are sorry that our proposal was not incorporated in the compromise resolution to depend on new reconstruction programs on the commitment of former Yugoslavia governments to work actively to combat organized crime. We hope, however, that the Council and the Commission will be able to mobilize these governments with their efforts and that the involvement of these two institutions in the conference projected to take place on 19 and 20 May will be the principle of effective action in this regard. Mr President, Tampere's Extraordinary Council last year had already recognized the extremely difficult situation in some areas of Europe when he decided in favor of holding the conference of 19 and 20 2000 on the safety and development of this area. Europe is trying to broaden its borders, is concerned about justice, security, freedom. The Adriatic is a border, the Ionian is a border. If we want to emphasize Europe's enlargement processes, we must assure our citizens, our fellow citizens, the inhabitants of these areas that our words are not political plans but real plans, which will come true, and that when we talk about justice and security, we offer them means, situations and systems. We already had too many dead: too many people left their last breath in this kind of raid on Puglia; we lost too many men of the class forces. There is a need, since there is also a consonant of stability, to intervene by specific means to show that, by expanding Europe, we are also expanding the security of our peoples. Mr President, I am divided on this issue. On the one hand, it is true - I was a rapporteur for the east enlargement and internal security - that we should not only take care of high safety standards in candidate countries, as we do in the EU, but of course in all European countries. We need a pan -European internal security system and of course we must of course take special care of the Balkans, because we have been responsible for Kosovo and the surrounding areas.	el
"I thank the rapporteur, Mr. Karl von Wogau, for his commitment and welcome the considerations he made.Furthermore, I would like to pronounce my recognition for that of Professor Tesauro, the President of the Italian Cartel Office, which Professor Monti will certainly take into account in a very cooperative spirit.The real problem undoubtedly consists in a stronger liberalization of the market and especially in the standardization of the various national markets, which currently have significant differences in a comparison between the English, Italian and French market;The French market is characterized by strong elements of state protectionism that do not exist in the English market and are extremely limited in Italy.Another problem is the economies of the countries willing to join, which run the risk of supporting support forever without gradual adaptation.In my opinion, a threshold should also be determined, below which two characteristic and important elements for our economic structure should be integrated, namely the SMEs that form the pillar of the European economy, as well as social protection that Europe has always granted to the economically weaker layers.The protection of the social function of the market is the distinguishing feature between a free economy Tout Court and a system that is used to improve the human quality of life.An aspect to be taken into account in the new legal provisions concerns the economy of the regions in an extremely outskirts and the island areas that must be preserved.Therefore, in my opinion, the creation of two foreign markets should also be considered, and fruitful relationships with Russia and the Mediterranean countries should be established so that the economies are less in an extremely outskirts.I wish - and in this regard, I would like to thank Professor Monti - that the new legal provisions are awarded a most widespread economic policy character and their social function is guaranteed.Mr. President, competition is the core and the strength of European internal market policy.A free open market can only exist thanks to competition, which is limited by clear, uniform rules of the game.Mr. Karl von Wogau sums up this in his report.But Europe is changing.The economies grow, soon we have 25 to 30 member states.The European Commission is overloaded with work if it continues to pursue current politics.Therefore, competition policy must be modernized.That is out of doubt.Nevertheless, the intended decentralization is worried.How will the Commission, as the guardian of the contracts, ensure that in London, Palermo, Helsinki and soon also in Budapest and Ankara by competitive matters?Legal relief must be avoided, and not the court that falls the mildest judgments may be flooded by competitive things.An indication that the Member States can look back on 40 years of experience is not enough.In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy.The country has a very small market, which unfortunately is often defined as the relevant market.Germany faces its extremely experienced cartel office that commands a gigantic market.The confidence of the European Commission that legislation is naturally interpreted in all directions, we describe Catholics as ""bold trust"", and that is prohibited."	de
It also had the advantage of strengthening the role of local authorities, non -governmental sector and local communities and supported new forms of partnerships for rejuvenating cities. The new initiative will continue to pursue these goals by reinforcing them, taking into account the promotion of equality of opportunities between men and women and the reintegration of socially marginalized and disadvantaged groups. We can therefore express our satisfaction with its approval. We must admit, however, that we cannot celebrate as far as funding is concerned! Indeed, the fiscal budget is not at all proportional to the challenges. Funding, amounted to € 900 million for the period 1994/1999, is around 700 million euros for the period 2000/2006, which is reduced by 30%! This reduction in financial resources has led to a reduction in the number of programs under the new Urban initiative. The ceiling of the 50 programs selected seems too low. It must therefore be increased in order to take into account regional and local agents, while at the same time maintaining financial aid in Member States. Given this gathering in a limited number of programs, the publication and dissemination of the results of the new Urban Community initiative will potentially be of particular importance in achieving a proliferative result. The McCarthy report on the Urban Community Initiative gives us the opportunity to consider the feasibility of a Community initiative in the urban environment. The situation in some urban areas is alarming and social misery is manifested in the form of unemployment, misery and crime. Drug trafficking specifically increases insecurity and daily crime. For such social challenges, the effectiveness of structural funds remains doubtful. Subsidiaryness should lead us to acknowledge that the state, in the context of the exercise of its sovereign powers, and local authorities are the most appropriate bodies to intervene in the proper way, the state ensuring public security and local authorities by providing assistance to those who face problems. We can, of course, express our satisfaction with the will to create a system of exchanges of successful experiences, but we cannot put the particular problems of each urban area at the same level. The Urban Community Initiative is part of the European Union's will to community bourgeoisie. It would be better for the Union to gather its financial efforts in existing European policies. Some, of course, benefit from the opportunity to indulge in a new fiscal exaggeration, particularly untimely exaggeration, while the EMU's convergence criteria impose on states a strict budgetary austerity. Thus, Mrs McCarthy proposes to increase the funds available in the Urban and promote this Community initiative through a costly communication campaign to launch the benefits of federal Europe. Does it need to be recalled that the effectiveness of an expenditure is not calculated on the basis of the amount of credit available in the project? On the contrary, the beneficiaries of too many and too high grants will consider them long -term acquisition. The goal should not be to provide assistance to citizens, but to develop their responsibility. Finally, the report is very much insisting on the actions in favor of minorities, considered based on ethnic and sociological criteria. We can only condemn a policy of minorities that necessarily threatens social cohesion.	el
Mr Barnier, Excuse me, but you did not give a full answer to the last part of my question about large energy transport networks. Could you answer this issue? Are you worried with the resources of structural funds we finance the installation of some nuclear power plants? Speaking shaped, we could say that there is no talk of that. I told you, a MP, that the choice of programs is the responsibility of the Member States, in accordance with the Regulation of the Structural Funds. Consequently, Commission services are not systematically informed of all programs selected. However, you do well and ask me, this is your job, as is mine to answer you. As already in the past, Member States must answer if the Commission is asking or asking them to clarify. I will therefore go a little further beyond the confidence that usually exists between the Member States and the Commission and in the specific point you will address I will precisely consider how things are. The state or Member States involved will be obliged to answer me, and I will immediately forward this answer to you. It seems to me that I answered the question about the big energy transport networks. The energy situation is largely different in the regions of the European Union and the strengthening of structural funds can be justified in some cases for some regions, especially since the connection to basic energy networks has not yet been developed. This is the answer I can give you about the connection of the large dasate energy and structural funds. Question No.46 of K. (H-752/00): Subject: Structural Funds and Prosthetics Given the recent useful answer given by the Commission to the written priority question I have submitted about the structural funds and the principle of addiction, I would like to ask whether the committee would seek. In particular, would the Commission see a change in the rules positively to ensure that prosthetics would work not only at the level of the Member States but also within the Member States, with regard to fiscal provisions between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries? I would like to reply to Mr MacCormick that the Commission does not consider amending the regulatory provisions on addiction, which for the period 2000-2006 are presented and clarified in Article 11 of the General Regulation of the Funds. As in the past, these provisions stipulate that the principle of prosthetics is applied to the relationship between structural funds and all costs, I emphasize all the costs of the Member State on growth. In this respect it should be emphasized that supplementary must be the costs funded by structural funds. It is not necessary for the co -financing provided by the Member State to be complementary, that is, to be added to its existing expenses. As long as the Member State does not diminish all its own expenditure, we can consider, and we consider that the resources of the structural funds are added to national spending and that the principle of addiction is therefore respected. With regard to the budgetary provisions implemented within the Member States, between the central government and the internal autonomous regions or countries, they are determined on the basis of exclusive national criteria and are therefore not influenced by prostheticity, in the sense specified in the relevant rules.	el
"I expect in particular from the Portuguese presidency that she takes advantage of the enormous work of the Finnish presidency to present proposals and coordinated action plans between the Member States.On the international level, action plans are already in place to fight scourges such as drug trafficking and money laundering.On a more human scale, however, many things remain to be done: firstly, help those who try to get out of the drugs and offer them adequate controls and mechanisms for their reinstatement;Second, ensuring coordination between police forces and judicial systems with regard to joint sentences and legal provisions;Third, carry out an information and awareness campaign focused on young people;Fourth finally, eliminate once for all these very dangerous concepts that are ""normalization"" and ""reduction in drug harm"" and show that any decline in our determination to fight against the legalization of drugs must be in the interest of all.Mr. President, I would like to take advantage of the few lean seconds of speaking time which are granted to me to report or remind the representative of the Commission that the Belgian government is currently carrying out a policy that will allow thousands, or even tens of thousands of foreigners in illegal situations, to be regularized and to be granted a permanent right of residence, the right to family reunification, etc.This measure of the Belgian government constitutes a blatant offense to the Schengen Convention.On December 23, I introduced a written complaint on this subject to Commissioner Vitorino.I would like to ask him to examine this complaint and to make myself known as soon as possible the measures that the Commission will adopt to sanction the violation of the Schengen Convention by the Belgian State, under article 226 of the Treaty.Mr. President, dear Portuguese friends and, in particular, dear representatives of the Council, you are faced with great expectations from us.By an example, I would like to show you how you can respond relatively quickly to these expectations, at least partially.This is Eurodac.You remember that in December, this European Parliament has decided, full of hope, that Eurodac should become reality as regulation and system, as a community instrument which we had an urgent need to no longer allow multiple asylum requests, to have an instrument against illegality and, above all, to establish in an undoubtedly establishing which a specific asylum application was.We have clearly spoken out in favor of this instrument, with an application committee and a suitable database established within the Commission.We thought that Eurodac had to come true.In Tampere too, we thought that Eurodac should come true.But as soon as the summit was followed in December, the Council has embarked on another path and took a new step back by deciding - which we have resolutely rejected - to maintain the execution skills within the Council, to add the Application Committee to the Council and to perhaps use Gibraltar as a means of pressure."	fr
That is why we believe that you did well and sent a message and that those who have challenged it may still be influenced by a Bolshevik or Nazi culture, because democracy means that we are having a dialogue with others and that we give them to understand when they are wrong, but also that we hear them. Enlargement - The National Alliance has repeated it in the European Parliament for ten years - it cannot mean weakening, and therefore cannot mean risks. The expectations of candidate countries are at least as important as the expectations of our own fellow citizens, who are beginning to be seriously frustrated by the functioning of this Europe that cannot solve the most serious problems. It therefore needs strictness in enlargement, with respect to those consonants who - when necessary - should be recast in relation to certain fundamental problems: everything that happened in Romania, to Belgrade - its environmental and ecological tragedy - but mainly its ecological tragedy. Even today there are no certain answers to control nuclear power stations in Eastern European Republics. Consequently, before any enlargement we must find the necessary resources to finally implement a European control force responsible for controlling quality and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur. I would also like to say a few words about Africa, Mrs. President. The third and fourth world have been abandoned to their fate: there would be a dollar, one and a half euros, to save many children. So democratic and progressive Europe is silent and does not face these tragic problems, while half Africa dies of AIDS and other diseases. A last observation on Internet and globalization. The globalization of the economy cannot be converted into homogenous products and qualities as well as globalization of politics cannot be transformed into a leveling of values, hopes and excitement. The peoples who do not participate and slowly move away make space in an oligarchy that takes power and leaves control to a few. As for the Internet, Europe finally has the courage to say that rules are needed. Allow me to personally applaud the pirates of the internet, who in the way they are doing are forcing people to reflect on the unique system that today has no rules. We are the world of rules: we even impose rules on the internet, thus giving rules and hopes to the future of our fellow citizens. Madam President, as a taxpayer in the Pados region, I have already met the taxpayer of Prodi, then leader of the Italian government, which is also taxed by the Pados region. I have heard him now with concern referring to new resources, an idea that is easily translated into the imposition of new taxes in view of, inter alia, the enlargement, that is, the entry of new states into the Union. But why don't they pay their entry ticket themselves? My voters in the Pados region, who, thanks to Prodi, have already paid the tax known in Italy as a tax on Europe - which is only partially returned - have absolutely no intention of paying, always thanks to Prodi, and other taxes for anyone else.	el
I would like to tell the Portuguese Minister that I totally agree with her that the issue lies in the fact that there can be no equal rights without equal power. This is crucial. But we must also remember that no one is voluntarily assigned, and this is true for both men and women. The men never wanted to assign the positions of power they held, but on the other hand there are few women who were willing to assign their own positions of power - I think of the position of power against their children in particular. After all, I would also like to say that this may be one of the reasons that there are so few men here today. We would of course like to have the right to have this discussion little by us, for the same reasons for political power. What I want to emphasize, with what I say, is that the issue is about the assignment of power on both sides. The Commissioner emphasized that what we need is a policy composition of many different things, and specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden. I just want to say that it could also mention Denmark. Of course I say this because I come from Denmark. In fact, the Danish government is made up of 45% of women and is in fact more than the percentage of women in the Finnish government. We may not have a female president, however, we have a queen and, in some circumstances, is pretty much the same. I would like to refer to some places that the Commissioner has raised, especially on the issue of fiscal resources. It is absolutely necessary to accept that there is a cost in order for women to get equality in the short term. In the short term, it is of course necessary to give the responsible care of the children, as well as, of course, to their responsible training. So there is a matter of suitable structures. One could easily wonder if the traditional industrial culture was particularly good, and that's why I am very pleased that the Portuguese ministers participated very actively in the Lisbon Summit, where the issue of IT development was discussed. In this area I believe that there are some very good opportunities for women, especially because they are not hierarchy, but flat structures. In any case, in Denmark we have seen a development that shows that too many female entrepreneurs appear. There are two points that were not mentioned with sufficient seriousness and which I would like to mention by closing. One is the subject of the effect of media. I believe it is very important to research what the stereotypes that the media create are. Is there a special problem because of them? I have to say that I don't know it precisely. But I have a suspicion that there is a problem, even though I'm not sure. The other issue is enlargement. I think it is very important, as we are now emphasizing in terms of enlargement, to put some demands that will allow the new Member States to be represented by both men and women, so that the women of these states can rely.	el
Unfortunately, nothing will change now and will not change anything in the future.They want to drive the devil out with the Beelzebub and apply the same fateful methods and the same economic principles to areas that have so far been withdrawn their responsibility: education, wage policy, direct taxes, labor law, social protection and social assistance.The most extraordinary in all of this is the fact that this policy of social mining is largely operated by left -wing governments of various stripes - pink, red, green - that preach social justice during the election campaigns, but take general social cuts as soon as they are at the top of the state.At this point I would like to reaffirm our conviction that without national and European priority and without the protection of our markets from the brazen global competition, no social policy and no policy of full employment are possible.When it comes to jobs, social security, family or pension policy, we must first think of the Europeans.The globalization of the economy you operate is neither necessary nor fateful.This globalization is violently enforced by the only superpower that has survived the Cold War and by the multinational corporations, which develop into independent business powers that submit to the states, nations and peoples who are unable to defend themselves.They make themselves complicit in this development.They promote this process, they are working on the disintegration of our social protection systems, despite their announcements, they create uncertainty and organize social reduction.For the European social model, this globalization of the economy, especially in the form in which it takes place today, could be fatal without taking into account the social and national peculiarities of the states.Your escape to the front into extreme liberalism certainly does not enable the solution to the social problems, the problems of uncertainty and the employment problems of millions of European Europeans.Mr. President, at the summit in Lisbon we will hear many nice words again.We will be happy to listen to these words, but you will not change anything about the basic problem: that we have an economic and monetary union that is more important to combat inflation than employment.The central bank has announced that the price increase rate must never exceed 2 %.The stability pact states that the deficit in the budget law may be a maximum of 1 % in normal years.On the other hand, there is no demand that unemployment must be lower than 5 % or - even better - lower than 2 or 1 %.It is more important that the cash prize and public expenses are not allowed to increase.It is conceivable that a country wants to combat unemployment with public investments, but that is prohibited.The monetary policy is said to be preserved as a holy cow, which is more important than giving the unemployed a job.It is more important for me that the family budget is okay that Papi receives wages, not the termination.That was the attitude of the Danish government, which was formed in 1993.In 1992 there were 9.2 % unemployed - in Euroland, i.e. in the 11 countries, and also in Denmark.From 1992 to 1998 the unemployment rate in Denmark fell to 5.1 %.In Euroland it rose to 10.9 %.	de
I will give you an example.In the report of the 1998 Court of Auditors, an error in calculation in exchange rates concerning Italian wine will have cost 8 to 10 million pounds sterling to European taxpayers.It is clear that it is unacceptable.What about the person responsible for the calculation error?We need a system offering bonuses and promotions and these promotions must be based on merit.We admit that most of the commission officials are major workers.But we also note that certain practices are obsolete.We are impatiently awaiting the complete proposal of the Commission on the Reformation and we hope that we will be able to settle the details together, since, contrary to what Mr. they have just said, the commissioner is committed to discussing it with the Parliament by March 1.We must also recognize that those who live in glass houses should not throw stones.The European Parliament has not always been very clear, in its approach, during its history.We must also go a long way before reaching perfection.Our personnel policy is herself obsolete.Some of our work practices should be radically changed.I hope that Parliament will remain in the wake of the commission throughout this reform process.We share the proposals relating to the establishment of the budget on the basis of activities.We admit that this presupposes discipline on the part of commission officials and we also admit that, within the parliament, we are responsible for the discipline when we speak of negative priorities.Finally, I would add that the Commission must revive its relations with citizens.European taxpayers should be reassured.The fate of the Commission and the European Union as a whole is based on the delivery of this reform.This is the key question is the delivery of these proposals.Mr. President, to start I would like to send my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr. Van Hulten, for his first report.I have a particular admiration for his courage, of which he did not depart when he was buried under the amendments.I believe that the Sages' report was useful, especially for Parliament - as Morgan said - and that we did well to ask for this occasion the advice of independent experts on how to manage our administration.We have filed an amendment on this subject.I would like to insist on some of the many points of Mr. Van Hulten's report, not according to their importance but according to an arbitrary choice.I think first of all that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper conservation of documents.The Archives of the Commission leave to desire.We found it when we had to investigate the Fléchard affair which has still not been clear.Oddly, very important documents had disappeared from the firms, even that of the president and various general directions, but it is something which, obviously, cannot happen.	fr
"What kind of ideologically inspired views may lead to what kind of contradictions or insanity may lead to a statement on the Committee on Equal Rights and Equality, which, for example, calls for a disclosure of a fundamental right to deny a sexual orientation, but which, on the other hand, believes that family rights do not exist. Caution is in place for well -meaning and generous proposals if we want to prevent numerous appeal procedures paralyzing the EU decision -making processes, the European Court of Justice will have to double the number of judges and no one knows where he can claim his or her fundamental rights..(SV) We consider the start of the work on the preparation of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The fundamental rights book has a very important symbolic value and strengthens the confidence of Union citizens in the integration of the EU and the European. The Fundamental Rights Book complements the European Convention on Human Rights, which we believe must be recorded in the Treaty. The fundamental rights book must focus on the relationship between citizens and European institutions. Its top goal must be to guarantee open management of the Union. The fundamental rights book must be made legally binding by including it in the EU Treaty. The fundamental rights book must not only be a declaration which in no way obliges EU institutions and Member States. We want to emphasize the principle of subsidiarity and the fact that the fundamental rights book must focus on the fundamental rights of citizens as presented in the common tradition of Member States. We need to emphasize the importance of the social dimension in the activities of the EU, but we believe that each Member State must be able to decide for its own social policy..(FR) The Fundamental Rights Book is the latest misfortune of the Community legislation constitutional. In fact, the importance of such a text is obvious if it is deemed to be a possible introductory part of the European Constitution;In the opposite case, its use would overlap in the case of Member States that include the rights in their own constitution and legal traditions and strengthen international texts, such as the European Convention or the General Declaration of Human Rights. We can always consider the solutions to improve the application of existing texts, but even today, the technocratic nature of community construction requires the preparation of extra text, where it is difficult to avoid repetition. However, I am most concerned about the content that is meant to be given to these rights. In fact, during this same session period, we will discuss the reports of the Committee on Civic Freedom, where we are presented with an anarchist view of society. It is not so much about defending and promoting human rights as to the elimination and replacement of all of our societies with an individualistic and vague statement ""without God and without the Host"". This construction is the foundation of a new kind of totalitarianism, where the individual stands alone in the community as distant as the impersonal administration, because the organs - and especially the most important of them, the family - has been gradually destroyed. Our society is no longer a community of destiny but a ""minority"" community, each with their own rights without a common obligation. My conclusion from these texts is that the legitimate battle of human rights has become an ideological toy of irresponsible and selfish persons. This means the end of the common good and, in addition, even the end of the meaning of life that today are suggested by those who have forgotten that, in the absence of human rights, that the human being and his or her roots and wishes are priority..(EN) Members of the Labor Party fully support a book of fundamental human rights, which makes citizens' rights visible throughout the European Union. However, we are only at an early stage in defining a fundamental rights book. So it is too early to say what should be legally binding. This decision will only be made at a later date, as is granted by the report in paragraph 6. This paragraph also states that any legally binding document recognizes that fundamental rights are inseparable by incorporating all the institutions and bodies of the European Union in the Charter and all its policies."	fi
"In terms of substance, these proposals establish a service provider-EC card which will allow in the future to about 5 million third-state nationals, who are legally residing in a Member State of the European Union, to provide their services to other Member States, which is currently obstructed by problems such as obtaining visa and license. The first Directive proposal will allow businesses based in one Member State and employed by employees who are third -state nationals to temporarily detach these employees in another Member State to provide their services there. As far as the provisions provided for, the employer will simply be responsible for requesting a service card for any interested employee. Logically, in order to be able to obtain such a card, the employee must legally reside in a Member State and be covered by a social security regime. The second proposal grants the same rights to self -employed workers who are third -state nationals. Although I essentially agree with the European Commission's proposals, it is a fact that some provisions could cause confusion. That is why I vote in favor of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This will help to clarify the provisions and consequently to prevent any abuse! Other amendments are intended to simplify administrative procedures by authorizing, for example, the Member States to determine a single competent authority for issuing the cards. I consider such a modification necessary in order to avoid administrative slowness, which often interrupts the proper implementation of new provisions. Consequently, I can only express my satisfaction with the approval of these instructions as amended. Indeed, it would no longer be able to tolerate people who are legally inhabited in the territory of the European Union to face so much difficulties. This is contrary to the fundamental principle of non -discrimination, which is established by the founding conditions of our Union. Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000) :, in writing.(FR) We have serious reservations about the amendment proposals of the Council. It is indeed inexplicable that, while we must increase the number of judicial courts of the European Communities due to excessive workloads, it is also proposed to extend its field of powers. The results of the first measure will be de facto de facto. Some will say that nothing is perfect in this world, but a brief historical overview will allow them to better understand our reservations: On January 1, 1995, the Council again raised the issue of increasing the number of judges specified in Article 17 of the June 24th Treaty, 1994, 1994. Court of First Instance, restless due to the continued increase in the volume of appeals, he already insisted on the need to take measures ""otherwise the court would soon be unable to respond in the best possible way to the principle of goodness of justice and to fulfill the mission assigned to him;But what did we do in Amsterdam? Nothing in this direction."	el
This is the linchpin to ensure efficiency and security.We will create a management and control system in each general directorate.The control system is currently centralized;With the reform, we go to a control system in which the decentralization of administrative controls and an efficient central audit system are connected: We will therefore have a central financial service that defines and advisable the regulations for financial management;A decentralization of the entire chain, namely the programs, obligations, contracts, expenses and the corresponding ex-Ante control systems, will take place at the level of the individual general directors, and there will be an external audit service that will control all of these operations.This means a total change in the working method of the Commission, a completely new organization that also requires an absolutely new culture.We are fully aware of the problems associated with this transition phase, and this transition phase is also the most concerned with our staff: we will therefore take the necessary safety and protective measures.Because with the reform, the Commission wants to develop into an administration that is exemplary for Europe and for the whole world.We also want to be a role model for the advanced use of information technologies.We want to give an example of a completely IT-based administration.The Commission was accused of buried under Bergen of paper;We will therefore be a paperless commission, a commission without paper, so that we can become more efficient internally and contribute to the increased use of the new technologies.This means not only a technical, but a complete organizational change.I will now leave it up to Kinnock to explain this reform in detail, but not without thanking him beforehand for the prudence, the enthusiasm and the energy he used for this work.With him, I would like to thank him to those who participated in the project, as well as the entire Commission staff, who participated in this most comprehensive discussion process, which has ever taken place in the Commission.I would like to emphasize that this is an extraordinarily new method of discussion, which in my opinion also forced us to change a radical change in our way of thinking.The white book ahead of us is also the result of your contribution: You understood that only a profoundly reformed commission can again become the world's highly valued institution that formed the starting point for the history of Europe.With the acceptance of the white book, a chapter of the past - as I hope and wishes - is finally completed.Now we are looking into the future, the challenges before the Union and all the goals of the 2000-2005 program, which we have already explained here in the past few weeks before you.In these objectives of the five -year program, the deeper political reasons for the reform lie.We - the whole Union - need a strong commission, a commission that regains its ability to act as a political actor who is recognizable as such as such.That is why we now set all priorities that we have to concentrate on.Therefore - this is another important chapter - we get rid of such activities, the implementation of which is no longer appropriate for us in accordance with the decentralization and subsidiarity principle.	de
"At the 55th meeting of the Human Rights Commission last year, the United States decided in an already well -advanced phase to contribute a draft decision to China.This draft decision was brought down by a Chinese non -termination application.The European Union voted against this application.The position of the European Union on the attitude that the Human Rights Commission should take to China was confirmed by the Council ""General Affairs"" on March 21, 1999: No initiative of the European Union in relation to China and no support for a resolution of China, in the coordination of the non -interference application by the European Union.It is not certain whether the cohesion of the European Union could have been maintained, the decision would have been made to vote.The United States will bring a draft decision to China at the 56th meeting of the Human Rights Commission, and are currently putting pressure on the European Union so that it agrees to the draft.This triggered violent reactions on the side of China: Currently, the Chinese authorities in the federal states and the organs of the European Union are taking steps to prevent them from supporting the United States' initiative.This initiative is being discussed in the Union, but an early decision is not to be expected.It is in the interest of the European Union to keep all alternatives in the context of the dialogue between the European Union and China about human rights as long as possible, but in any case open until after the conference on February 25, 2000.In view of the changes that have been compiled in the composition of the Human Rights Commission, the vote on the non -arrangement application will be discontinued.Therefore, it is important that the countries of the European Union agree again this year the point of view they want to take in the event of a possible coordination on the resolution.In this context, it should be pointed out that the European Union regularly opposes the requests of China to automatically exclude the presentation of a resolution at the Geneva Human Rights Commission from the dialogue about human rights.The European Union clearly believes that the dialogue is a very valuable instrument to carry out an exchange of views and to learn about the reasons for the attitude of the other side that it must also produce concrete results on site.If this does not succeed, a resolution of the Human Rights Commission may be necessary, if necessary in the further course of the dialogue.In addition, the European Union repeatedly states that the human rights commission is the appropriate authority to bring up human rights issues and that the initiative - regardless of whether the European Union decides to support it or not - from this point of view.The next dialogue about human rights will take place on February 25 in Lisbon, and this includes seminars on legal questions and the rights of women, in which representatives from science circles and civil society should also take part.The next seminar on human rights will be carried out by the Portuguese presidency in May 2000.At the last dialogue round in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the technical aid offered by the European Union to support the international pact of the international pact on economic, social and cultural rights and the international pact of the civil and political rights of the United Nations that the Chinese government signed."	de
"These recurring disasters have nothing natural, they are also not given fate.They are the consequence of the human inconsistency.It is an ecological catastrophe.Only those who are very far away from the hard realities on site can doubt this.It is also an economic catastrophe for all those who live from the sea and tourism like fishermen, oyster breeders, mussel breeders, salt workers, retailers, etc. The Supergau of the Erika must be the last of this series.First of all, it is important to fully clarify the circumstances of this accident.Why shouldn't one use a parliamentary investigation committee or include the MPs in the mission that has just been announced by the Commission?Then we urgently need to issue legal provisions so that the exact characteristics of the goods carried out are primarily recorded.Because according to expert opinion, the oil on Erika would have had to sink to the bottom and could never reach the coasts.The consequences are known.It is also important to introduce reliable technical monitoring, similar to the technical monitoring of motor vehicles prescribed in France, which is older than five years.It is also necessary for regulations for the use of complicity flags, the demand for a double outer skin in ships to promote environmentally harmful and dangerous goods, technological innovations for the treatment or recovery of mineral oils at sea.That would be a minimum in my opinion at the beginning of the third millennium.Ships that do not meet the conformity requirements must be prohibited from driving on European waters.At the same time, the responsibility of the damage caused by the damage, the shipowner and the questioner must be determined according to the cause of the cause and the monitoring of the sea in order to prevent any degassing, enforced a serious and reliable control of the tankers, set up a well -equipped household line ""natural disasters"" for the member countries, introduced a special assistance of the community and the damaged departments as eligibleStructure funds are classified.In the name of the Edd faction, I brought a draft decision on this topic.President!In recent years, there have always been severe tanker disasters worldwide without any noteworthy or effective countermeasures.This time it is particularly bad, not least because it has hit a large European state, an incident that can repeat itself at any time.We urgently need a guideline to restrict these dangers.The 15 obviously are not enough.These guarantee - without entitlement to completeness - at least 3 points: No scrap tank tanker or freighter can ever start a port of the European Union more.All those involved, including the client of the transport, are liable for the consequential damage, and there are sufficient insurance from these involved.This is the only way to have a chance to get their claims for damages.However, it must be clear to us that the long -term goal must be stuck even further.This means that we need a real cost of cost for our entire energy supply system.Mr President, first of all, I would like to thank Ms. Commissioner Palacio for her factual, appropriate and binding answer.Thank you very much.At the same time, your notification dated January 10 and the action plan announced by her today absolutely necessary.The disaster with Erika proves that if, when conclusive traffic and transport regulations are missing at international and European level, nature and the environment are missing."	de
Two days later, toyota, who employed several thousands of people in my area, announced that in addition to raising the prices of cars, it would also mean redundancies at the Toyota Derbyshire factory. When regulatory reduction is certainly a key factor in the world, we show here in Parliament that we can increase the regulation and costs of businesses and that they remain in the European Union and do not feel the temptation to move elsewhere with fewer restrictions. We members of the Parliament often talk about SMEs and have now come up with a unique way to create them. Let's take a large and successful company, increase European regulation and after a few months the result is a small company. Perhaps we should look at ourselves and what we do here before we criticize anyone outside this place. Dear President, I do not use my speech time to intervene in the individual cases that are discussed today. I agree with the member Plooij-Van Gorsel that we cannot talk about them in detail. Perhaps we could discuss the next time the Corus fusion, which has been created between our Dutch Hoogovens company and British Steel. I would like to guide this debate into a slightly wider connection and also look at the link between political policies and policies in other areas of the European Union. That is why I am delighted that a member of the Commission Liikanen is present and that we do not have to have this debate on the interests of the employees only with the Commission's DiamantoPoulou but also with the members of the Commission in other areas. I also want to emphasize the importance of unity of the Commission's politics from different angles - unlike the previous speaker, who starts with the rules. We must specifically develop a vision of what companies are today. Currently, many major mergers are happening between Anglo -Sex's traditions and more of the Rhine -representing companies. In this context, it is, of course, very essential what is left out of the notion of the company today, whether it is only the property of the shareholders and their equipment, or whether it is a broader shareholder community to ensure continuity for employees, consumers, suppliers and local population. So I want to ask that the various Directors and members of the Commission to share their wider views on the management of the companies for once. In my opinion, it would also fit very well with the plans for the good administration of the European Union, which have been presented in recent days, as they also include corporate policy. In Italy, the government will also face the departments of the trade union and Goodyar representatives to find a solution to the ending policy of a North American multinational company, as it has made a one-sided decision to close a production facility in Central Italy, Cisterna di Latina, which has already suffered from structural reform. Closing means direct and indirect effects, taking into account the loss, uncertainty and new poverty for hundreds of families. Goodyear employees are an exemplary struggle that they are not only defending their own interests, but also the interests of many other Goodyear employees in several European countries: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia. Today, there is a small employee delegation in this hall, and they hope to know how their future and what kind of solidarity the European Union offers, what kind of policy it pursues to prevent multinational companies from acting solely for their own commercial and returns. Goodyear, like other multinational companies, has received over 166 billion. The European Union, all its parties, must exercise all its power in order to resolve this and other disputes. Earlier this week, President Prodi, President Prodi, announced that a five -year strategic goal of the Commission would be to seek full employment.	fi
"Therefore, the first thing to do with these routes is to be properly developed. Undoubtedly, this depends on our society and its development. However, I do not think we cannot suppress development;What does not mean that you do not take any action you need to make this development most in the environment, so that the negative effects on it are the least, especially in areas that may be vulnerable to wounds that may be. Mr President, I would like to warmly thank the Member of the Commission for his great sensitive duty, which he has shown for the time being in the Brenner traffic and Brenner basic tunnel, and, above all, for the statement that the environment has to be taken into account accordingly. I would like to suggest that the Commission has already thoroughly and intensively investigated the ATT3 alternative project over the last two years, for this I would like to thank the Commission's member Kinnock and CEO Coleman, which I was also told in writing. I would like to add that the colleague's Messner question includes a design: ""If a new railway is built, one should look at the option that would affect the environment as little as possible.""I find it completely incomprehensible that the Commission is presented in this regard that the environmental impact must be as small as ever. This is about the population of the sensitive area and must be protected. When this requirement is still made by the Greens, it is all the more incomprehensible and also rejected for this reason..(ES) The Brennero project is one of the 14 projects related to European -wide transport links, and of course, the Commission will continue to support this project, although in the end, the Member States must complete its development. Much thanks, the Member of the Commission. As the time reserved for the Commission Question Time has expired, questions 64 and 114 will be answered in writing. I declare the questioning hour of the questions addressed to the Commission.(The session was suspended at 7:25 pm and continued at 9:00 pm)(10656/2/1999-C5-0223/1999-1996/0312 (COD))..(De) Mr President, you already said that this is another processing of the environmental marking regulation. The European environmental brand is a child created by the internal market, so it must be said. It has a purpose - to some extent in response to growing cross -border flows - marking products and services that are very environmentally friendly. Thus, on the one hand, it aims to provide consumers with cross -border knowledge and, on the other hand, raise awareness of industry and citizens to identify and establish environmental policy connections. This is particularly important in the context of daily purchases. In my opinion, there is no need to discuss the rationality of the European brand suitable for the European internal market. However, there is often a long way between a good idea and its rational implementation. This also applies to the environmental brand. Nowadays, the brand is fascinating, especially because it is not known in most countries. I think only a small minority of citizens has been face to face with it. As a result, in my presentation, I have drawn the brand's brand to completely inadequate preparation. What are the deficiencies of the environmental brand regulation to date to the current unsatisfactory situation? In my opinion, the biggest problem is related to the brand's cost structure. The test methods of the products that companies must perform to obtain a sign are long and expensive. For this reason, we demand that the minimization of costs must be paid as much as possible at the test criteria. Needless to say, this should not be misunderstood by weakening the quality criteria for tests. In addition to the cost of the test procedure, the running fees for the European environmental branding system must also be taken into account."	fi
I therefore want to reiterate my congratulations to the rapporteur Mr. Langen for the work he has done, to congratulate all the speakers, and of course to praise the attitude of Vice -President Mr. Provan during the conciliation for an effective contribution to achieving a positive result. I also congratulate the logical and flexible attitude shown by the Council. Save The agenda provides for the discussion of the report (A5-0010/2000) of Mrs Ahern, on behalf of the European Parliament Delegation to the Committee on Conciliation on the Committee of Conciliation Committee on the European Parliament's Decision Plan and the Council for the establishment of a multi-year-wide program for actions in the field of action-SAVE.(C5-0334/1999 - 1997/0371 (COD)) Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for making a beneficial and thorough conciliation process, and even a calm conciliation in every respect, which is not always the case. I am pleased to say that I can consider the end result of the conciliation very satisfactory to the European Parliament, since all of its amendments were included in a modified form in the common plan. The amount finally allocated to the program is also a significant improvement compared to the Council's proposal in the second reading, which we considered to be completely unacceptable, and so we made great progress. I therefore propose in Parliament to approve proposals on Save and the result of conciliation during the third reading. I would like to remind the House that in the second reading the parliament approved this report with eight amendments, including the reinstatement of the budgetary funds initially provided by the Commission. The Commission received five of the proposed amendments, including the disposal of the credits, and thank it for its continued support for the budget during the conciliation process, as the Council's proposal was unacceptable. During this procedure, an agreement was reached on the studies and actions on the preparation, implementation, completion and evaluation of Community measures. Compromised texts have been found for five other amendments, including legislative and non -legislative measures, as well as the inclusion of local energy centers and, very important, energy control systems in monitoring the progress of energy efficiency. I hope you all agree that this is significant progress. Parliament has decisively defended the issue of the budgetary funds against the council of the council. In the end, several meetings were needed before the Council eventually agreed to increase the budgetary budget to a significant amount. We have achieved an increase in the original fuel by 2 million, an increase in decisive importance that I can recommend to approve, and by which the Commission confirmed that it can implement the programs. This has been an important factor for us. However, I would like to point out that the budget is, as it has always been, very small, and therefore the financing of this program is more symbolic than essential. Energy saving funding is still mainly coming from the Member States, which we must keep in mind when we approve this program. It is a shame that we can achieve at the Community level to be more symbolic than substantial, as there is a great deal of excitement locally for action, including Community actions, with the aim of saving energy.	el
This is to be recognized by the goal supported by the Labor party members. As the final text of the Charter is not available, we support the Charter Book in principle, but we look forward to the final version. This is a complex process that requires clarity and precision at all stages to ensure that the end result is a positive and visible step forward to people in all EU Member States..(PT) The blank voice we give to this report on the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights is due primarily to the fact that we think its logic is based on the federal concept we disagree with. That idea could be expressed clearly and definitively in the European Union Constitution, which is praised by the report and the important part of which would be that charter. However, as we agree with the many rights that are intended to record in the Charter, otherwise included in the Portuguese Constitution, we decided not to give a voice to the report, although we believe that these rights should unequivocally cover the social area. This would be a success if the reviews formed by the GUE/NGL group were approved..(DA) Freedom, democracy and respect for human rights are the basic principles of the European Union. However, I find it suspicious that the new collection of human rights would be included in the EU setting, because I think it gives a messy message and because I am afraid we will put existing and well -functioning tools at stake. I think the declaration would be much more appropriate. The European Human Rights Agreement is a great tool that can protect European human rights. This means that the maintenance of these rights is based on the decisions of the Court of Human Rights, as it has a great deal of professionalism and a broad practical experience in these matters. It also has the advantage that it is not limited to the EU only, but is operating almost on the entire European continent. At the same time, the European Court of Justice takes into account the national fundamental rights of the Member States. This activity could be influenced if the EU had its own fundamental and human rights. Jackson's resolution (B5-0227/2000) my group voted structural fund programs in the Member States and in favor of the Jackson resolution on the EU's national enforcement of the EU Environmental Laws in an effective implementation of environmental laws-in this case, the Directive and the Life Environment Directive of wild birds. However, we are surprised that members of this Parliament voted in favor of the original proposal in paragraph 7, which cuts the funding of some of the poorest areas of the EU. In fact, a member of the Commission said in response to the debate that he would not stop approval of key funding programs. Members of the Environment Committee can clearly not be aware of the unnecessary delays that any non-adoption of structural fund programs can create, and not from the new budget procedure, not only for delays, but also millions of losses in funds, in the United Kingdom of Merseys, South Yorkshire, Upper Maid and Islands, Northern IceFor Wight. These are vital funds for jobs and growth. Therefore, I consider the fact that Parliament voted as a majority against resource cuts. The Commission member would by no means have had the legal qualifications to stop approval and that is why I am delighted that in the end, common sense has won in the vote.- (de) it seems that community environmental protection does not have their own interest in community organs. Otherwise, it is not possible to explain why the Commission suddenly interpreted the Commission and interprets the Regulation on the General Regulations on Structural Funds in a new way. After the Commission drove very strongly last year and finally demanded a declaration of announcements for the Natura 2000 project, which was protected by the Hare Environment Directive for years, it undermined its decision by accepting that notifications could be submitted later. It was not necessary, as the Regulation completely covered the Commission's requirement to submit lists on the areas related to the habitat directive at the latest, together with regional development plans, and does not, in itself, leave any gameplay to the Commission.	fi
In my opinion, there are now two main problems with Geneva Conventions. Firstly, there is a gap between the principles and their compliance, and secondly, the Conventions do not cover some essential things. Allow me to describe the constantly deepening gap between the principles of the Conventions and their true compliance with their actual compliance with the fact that in the conflicts that have output in the last ten years, there are ten times more civilians than soldiers. This relationship is the opposite of the first World War. In my opinion, the deepening of the gap between the principles and their compliance is due to the fact that the nature of the war has changed over the last fifty years. More wars are held in anarchist conditions where there are no stable structures and where the war -torn areas are not under the supervision of any government. The world has been able to prove that wars have also increased with intentional armed attacks on civilians and where the war has been intended to destroy certain societal groups. In such situations, humanitarian aid for victims is, of course, not welcome and this brings the world to a very problematic situation. Another problem is that Geneva Conventions do not deal with the work of humanitarian actors enough. Although the Geneva Conventions contain provisions on the right to provide humanitarian aid in crisis situations, it states that this right requires the consent of the government's government. This is especially the case when it comes to internal government conflicts. The principle of giving humanitarian aid or the right of the international community to support people in need and take care of them, if the state is unable to do - or does not want to do it itself, is therefore not used worldwide. This is a serious violation of humanitarian principles and, in some cases, a fatal neglect that has caused the death of many war victims. When I visited Tsetsenia in early February, the main thing was that humanitarian relief organizations would have normal connections to the area. In my opinion, the important question at the moment is the extent to which circumstances require a review of Geneva Conventions and how it should be done. I believe we have two options that do not exclude each other. The first of these is the amendment of the Conventions so that they would better correspond to current complex crises, for example, to include the right to provide humanitarian assistance to those in need. Another opportunity is to ensure that we actually follow the humanitarian principles that have been decided in Geneva Conventions, for example by improving their application mechanisms. The first choice that we should re -evaluate the content of the Conventions to fill all the openings in them is a complex and dangerous option. It is complicated because warfare is constantly changing, and dangerous because we cannot rule out that if we renew the Convention on Conventions, we may no longer reach them. However, let me make it clear that I am fully in favor of accepting the principle that humanitarian assistance can be given in all situations and that we strengthen the right of the distress to receive humanitarian aid. From another choice, that is, that better adherence to existing principles needs to be ensured, I believe that imposing lawyers in legal responsibility is one of our best options and must be utilized. The Geneva Convention is recorded by the obligation of states to bring war criminals to legal liability, but it is clearly not enough. Therefore, I completely agree with the requirement that the ICC (International Criminal Court), the International Criminal Court, must be approved as soon as possible. It has also been highlighted in today's debate. On behalf of the Commission, I support that we have to cooperate in order to resolve this task and make it legally determined.	fi
"As you know, these objectives aim to reduce poverty by half by 2015, either thanks to the increase in the age of compulsory education, or thanks to the significant reduction in infantile mortality, or thanks to a set of interventions in terms of social well-being which effectively achieve this objective.This would mean to retreat extreme poverty in which a third of the world's population lives, to retreat the extreme poverty of living conditions of around a billion people, which is extraordinary but certainly requires strong participation and a strong intervention of the entire international community.This is the fourth aspect of the new development paradigm that I would like to accentuate: development policies are envisaged today, in particular in recent years, in the form of an increasingly global question which suffers from a lack of strong international leadership.The concerted actions of the United Nations system institutions contributed significantly, as well as the ""Bretton Woods"" system.In particular, the strong pulses given in this debate should be recorded in particular by the World Bank, in particular through its comprehensive framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund.For the first time an institution of this nature places the problem of the decline in poverty at the center of its orientations and establishes a so far unimaginable connection on the part of such an institution between the alleviation of debt and poverty.It is also in the light of this new role that international organizations fulfill in relation to the development problems that we must reflect on the role of the European Union in this context.The Portuguese presidency insists on the need for the European Union to make its important role more compatible on an international scale, as the main donor, with a director and more active role in this movement to renovate development policies, internationally, by increasing its capacity for articulation and coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system.So that it is possible to strengthen the role of the European Union in the context of international development policies, we believe that it is necessary to fundamentally develop three types of actions.First, improve the efficiency of the development policy.As everyone knows, an overall evaluation exercise of development policies took place in 1995. It was possible to present the conclusions under the German presidency.The main conclusions emphasize the need for a more coherent policy of the European Union and a general strategic vision of the European Union in relation to development problems.They accentuate the aspects relating to the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between organizational harmonization and simplification policies, an executive in which the Union cooperation policy runs, and the need to make the management of aid more effective, in particular by reviewing its intervention mechanisms, as well as the need to strengthen the evaluation system and to ensure more transparency in the way of applying this aid.The second aspect that must be underlined concerns the need for greater complementarity between the Union and the policies of the Member States."	fr
"If she cannot do it, as some deputies have raised it, it is because she went to Hungary and Romania to see the extent of the disaster and determine how to best help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to cope with this crisis.We are willing to do so.At the beginning of this month, we came into contact with the Romanian government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube, in order to obtain more information about the accident.The Romanians addressed themselves to the FNUE and the BCAH in Geneva to ask them that an international team of independent experts assesses the damage in the Danube basin.We are willing to collaborate in this evaluation if Hungary and Romania ask us for it and if access to the sites for nationals of the two countries is guaranteed, which is obviously crucial.It is obviously essential to draw up a specific table of the damage as quickly as possible so that we can decide exactly how to react as best as possible.The efforts we provide today pursue this objective.It is also necessary to shed light on the legal responsibilities of the mining company and the Romanian authorities.This point is important, as certain speakers have specified.The principle of polluter pays is a cornerstone of the environmental policy of the European Union.The international convention for the protection and sustainable use of the Danube reflects it and it should be applied in this specific case.The European Union should not bear the cost of compensation due in place of the mining company.The Union has mobilized some 20 million euros over the past seven years to support the protection of the Danube basin.As part of pre-pricing aid for the region, it may be possible to redirect part of the aid we provide via the ISPA and the flagship program in order to face the most harmful consequences of this accident, as long as the principle of polluter pays are fully respected.We will have, in the longer term, to see what lessons we can learn from this disaster and see how to prevent above all disasters.This incident gives more weight to the arguments in favor of strengthening European civil protection, as the Prodi president recently said during a speech and as one or two deputies we specify today.But for the time being, priority is to face the crisis.As I said, my colleague, Ms. Wallström is there today.She will have to hold the Parliament fully informed of the actions she will offer following this visit.This is a real catastrophe for Europe and Europe must respond to it and do everything in its power to prevent accidents as appalling as it continues to spoil its future.The debate is closed.We are now going to vote.Votes.The only reason why we voted for the resolution of PSE-Verts/Ale-Gue/NGL compromise is that only this resolution allowed us to ""condemn the decision of the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its Italian factory""."	fr
"How can I survive in my country who is responsible for a comprehensive service when releasing an abroad, which accounts for 25 %, while in other countries the share is less than 5 %? How do we handle the national mail going abroad? Member McCartin spoke earlier about this. Because technology development makes this transfer even simpler and more productive, this will be very likely to happen, and we need to handle the release gradually and controlled, and by defining weight and price limits. What, then, should there be? Is the right to use ""sniper"" to companies the right to use the weight threshold so they can easily rotate it, because of course the content of the letters cannot be controlled? Mr President, a Member of the Commission, in any case, we ask the Commission to show their cards and make their proposals and look at the development of the matter so far on every Member State that liberation is not a measures in itself, but a mere tool for improved services. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good colleagues, the goal of liberating traditional domestic postal services brings with it a necessary question of what tasks the mail holds in the future as its main task, what the mail still wants to do for itself, what it wants to do in one international framework and what it no longer does. Against the background, this question must be answered that all kinds of courier companies and technological development, such as faxes and e -mail, have already undermined the position of this ancient monopoly. On the other hand, employment is central to the release of the post office. The experiences of the past have shown enough that linear dismissal measures and encouraging voluntary resignation often have unwanted effects. I remember that the temporary lay -off employees of the Belgian telephone institution had to be asked to prevent the company not to lose too much skills and experience. An important topic of discussion related to the release of postal services is undoubtedly the reduction of staff. In this context, it must be borne in mind that encouraging the voluntary departure, first and foremost, makes people who are already under pressure or who are easily employed elsewhere, that is, are often the people that the company needs themselves. The fact that the Commission would take into account some of these concerns in order to be socially in the most calm way of being able to release both sensitive sectors and mail in the most calm circumstances would be a demonstration of a carefully considered HR policy. Mr President, Postal Services and Post Offices now seem to be a burning topic in Parliament, which is good because they are important topics. Just last week in the United Kingdom Parliament in Westminster, Plaid Cumry, a newly elected member of the European Free Alliance group, made his virgin speech on the subject. The Scotland Parliament also recently had a debate that refers to the role of post offices, and in particular rural mail offices, and their important role in maintaining and continuing services. Liberation of the sector is not the only possible threat to postal services. Post offices in Scotland, as we have heard, do much more than the distribution of mail. The state and other national authorities have traditionally paid state pensions and other benefits through them and have also been used as rental and local tax offices, and so on. But now that the modernization of the public payment system is increasingly moving to bank accounts and accounts, the viability of rural mail agencies is threatened. If the post office in the countryside has to be closed, often the only local store in connection with it will have to stop, and thus the entire profitability of the community is threatened and the result may be social exclusion. Instead of allowing the liberalization and modernization of the sector to weaken the operations of the post office, the governments, as well as the Commission, should encourage and support the extensive network of post offices and to be used as a resource that can be used by providing them with information and services to the residents."	fi
I will conclude, Mr. President, by affirming that progress is undoubtedly difficult, fragile, uncertain and that they demand on our part an assiduous follow -up of the different stages, punctuated by rigorous and meticulous control operations.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I intervene to express the enthusiasm and the hope with which the group of the European Party of Liberals, Democrats and Reformors welcomes the opening of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.I sincerely hope that this agreement may, as the rapporteur is considering, Mr. Swoboda, serve as an example to extend as quickly as possible to other countries in the region, especially to Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo and, perhaps one day, in Serbia.We are convinced that the rapid opening of these negotiations and their fastest conclusion offer the only possibility of restoring peace in the region, this peace which has not automatically followed the end of the war in Kosovo.We will thus avoid reproducing the conditions favorable to a new disintegration and the return of chaos and violence, with all the risks that this involves for the stability of the continent, even from the planet.If it is true that the courageous current process of enlargement of the Union towards the countries of Eastern Europe is of deep motivation The maintenance of peace and security, such motivation must be even more present in our relations with Albania and the countries of the former Yugoslav Republic and, in all, it imposes that we are resolutely committing to the path of this widening parallel to the countries of southern Europeon exam.It is in this spirit, at the limit of provocation, that we presented an amendment to the transfer of skills concerning southeast Europe of foreign affairs to enlargement.The idea of ​​faster and more direct participation in southeast Europe in the life of European institutions has also led us to propose to welcome the European Parliament a limited number of observers sent by national parliaments, which would also detach members of their workforce to work with the Court of Justice and the Commission.Be that as it may, we are convinced that, to promote the evolution of the region to a more democratic society, essentially based on the market economy, we must without delay taking concrete initiatives to intensify the fight against corruption and improve the effectiveness of international aid in favor of reconstruction and development.It is for this purpose that we have presented several amendments hoping that Parliament will accept them.Firstly, it is a question of removing customs duties on the exports of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia to the European Union and of compensating for the gradual reduction of customs duties collected by Macedonia on European products, provided that the principle of customs control is accepted in the borders of Macedonia.It is a question, secondly, of bringing the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, thanks to adequate financial support, to gradually mooring its currency to the euro, as the first step towards a Europeanization of the Macedonian economy as a whole and with the subsequent objective of eliminating any perversion of the banking system.Thirdly, it is a question of giving the world's assistance and assistance in favor of the region a certain character of multilaterality, without imposing on the beneficiary country of direct obligations towards the donor country.	fr
I also note that the report is affecting the horrifying practice of genital amputation and the lack of data on this issue. We are investigating ways as a committee with which we could contribute to finding a solution. The Commission is also working with other bodies to stop the heinous illegal movement of women who has been constantly intensifying in recent years. We issued an announcement in 1998 on this issue. The emphasis was on the prevention, research, enhancement of legislation, effective punishment of women and victims' support. We are working on this issue, as the Honorable Member knows, with NGOs, the OSCE and the candidate countries. In terms of children's rights, the STOP program has co -financed 67 programs to tackle trafficking and sexual exploitation against children with a budget of 6.5 million euros for the first five years. A new STOP program is planned to start this year and will be open to the countries to be integrated. Passing now on more general issues, I have mentioned the forthcoming announcement of human rights and external relations. My goal is to adopt a more effective and consistent approach to politics and costs, and in particular to improve the management of our programs in this area. Human rights programs are very different from those for the construction of bridges or to strengthen primary education. Our NGOs and partners from civil society are essential for their implementation. The programs are often carried out in difficult or dangerous conditions at times of the crisis. Those who execute the programs often face violations of their own rights, whenever they should not be surprised that NGOs often feel affected to provide the Commission boxes with evidence when returning to the base. The European Union's financial procedures, including financial regulation, are, to put it in for a lenient, non -friendly NGOs, and are they moving away from the true question: Should we stop financing NGOs or should we change our processes? The first is obviously impossible to happen as it would be completely undesirable. We could not work without NGOs. The reform of our processes, many of which were established by Member States at a time when NGOs almost did not exist, would take time, but we are now looking at it as part of the overall package of reforms. Unfortunately, we will not see changes from day to day. This brings me to the issue of budget and Parliament's proposal for a joint statement on annual increases in human rights costs. The size of the budget cannot be separated from the question of whether we can manage it. Otherwise we will give too many promises that we simply cannot fulfill and when the issue concerns the support of NGOs we often operate with minimal funds. Promises that are not respected lead to bankruptcy very soon. We have a bunch of programs that have been delayed and have to be completed and in the past we have not fully exploited our budget for human rights, so I find it difficult to justify an increase in spending until this issue is resolved. However, I want to make it clear: I would like to be as soon as possible to spend every euro of our budget and so we can justify much higher costs.	el
Skrapie is a particularly cunning disease, as the pathogen can remain active in dust for years and cause infection again through feeding. In all cases, illness leads to death. Because vaccination is not possible, the breeder can only protect themselves so that no more animals from countries that have occurred in Skrapie cases. Although Skrapie cannot grab a person, its connection to BSE - as already stated - has not yet been determined. The consumer must not have any risk, and this is a particularly important thing for me as a farmer. I am in favor of preventive measures that begin to feed on animal needs instead of trying to combat the disease that has already erupted. Therefore, I consider the Commission's initiative to create a new legal basis for the fight against Skrans. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Bögen's report on TSE's fighting measures, is one of the issues based on the proposals made by the European Parliament's Temporary BSE Committee. In this committee, the rapporteur Böge did a valuable job, and it is depressing to see that monitoring the work of the BSE Committee has naturally fallen for him in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development;He has experience. I would have liked to have used this speech in a discussion that would also have discussed the second part of the Commission's proposal at the same time. I do not consider it appropriate that we have to have the same discussion when Roth-Behrendt's report comes from the Committee on Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Policy to a plenary session. In the previous speech, Schierhuber stated that Skrapie is a very insidious disease. This is it. For me, as a Finnish, close to the agricultural sector and as a member of the health and transportation of animals, the most important thing is that for EU countries, where there are no TSA diseases at all, the right to inspect the transport of living animals will continue to be guaranteed. I want to emphasize how important the matter is for us. If necessary, the possibility of further inspection of animals in these areas is not artificial protectionism or restriction of free movement when there is a truly reasonable reason. Inspections must be seen as fair and cost -effective measures to promote animal welfare and prevent new costs for the EU. On behalf of the European Liberal and Democratic Party, we can support the Commission's proposal for the Böge report, but in the upcoming Roth-Behrendt report, we will have to return to the position of TSA. Mr President, I would like to say congratulations to the rapporteur. There is no doubt that the rapporteur Böge and the adoption of the Committee on the Environment are now real experts in this field. It is very good that they are still following this issue for Parliament because it is very important. Although we have many other concerns, BSE has left us with a terrible legacy that we have to resolve and we need to solve. It is quite clear that sheep's Skrapie has been a factor that promotes the whole problem. I find it positive that the legal base is now created and that new regulations can hopefully intervene in this situation. We need to make sure that nothing can be achieved in the food chain or feed mixture so that previous events can be repeated in the future. Nobody wants what BSE caused by the BSE disease will be repeated. We must introduce very severe regulations and make them work. Restoring trust is very important for both producers and consumers, and we can only succeed by intervening and solving it. The BSE disease really hasn't disappeared. It occurs in many countries. I don't want to show any particular country with my finger, but many countries now have similar problems as we had in the UK. BSE will still occur for some time. We need to make sure that the traceability system, which is monitored from birth to slaughter and across the food chain, is part of a mechanism that enhances trust.	fi
"Social security and social protection are one of the greatest achievements of employees in Europe, enforced in years of struggle against the efforts of major capital and thanks to the constant solidarity, as the employees are now.In today's Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently required to ensure further social protection and the expansion of the rights of employees.However, this requires a different system of economic and social development than the EU is able to produce due to its nature and its being.Summa Summarum we speak to ourselves against the ""modernization"" of the social protection system sought by the Commission with its communication and indicate that we will not agree to the committee for employment and social affairs for the debate.This ends the explanations of the votes.(The session is interrupted at 1:55 p.m. and resumed at 3:00 p.m..) Next meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission (continued) According to the agenda, the pronunciation of the Council on the Priorities of the Union for the next meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission (March 20, 2000) including the situation in China.President!I consider the absence of the reigning council president to be regrettable;It is about an explanation of the council, and I think that his participation in the continuation of the pronunciation might have been useful.It does not seem idle to remember that the inclusion of this point in the agenda is clearly due to the necessity that is expressed by all factions that the parliament carries out a pronunciation before the next meeting of the United Nations Human Rights Commission in Geneva in order to be heard in a topic that is so sensitive to this parliament.I think after explaining the incumbent Council Presidency and the Commission, we can all match the fact that the current situation in the field of human rights is far from what would be desirable.At the Union's level, we cannot avoid that the situation is not completely satisfactory, because, for example, although the convention to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms is a common element to all member states, not all of their subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all states.A clear disadvantage in this area is also the fact that the European Union as such is not a signatories of the European Convention to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms, with all the additional difficulties that this condition entails.I hope that all of these problems can be addressed and treated as part of the discussion, which is currently being conducted on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.At the level of foreign policy, I believe that most of the points recorded in our resolution convey a visual view of reality and do not exactly give rise to optimism, because aspects such as the abolition of the death penalty, which are still pronounced in many pronounced torture or the location of the minorities in many parts of the planet require a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union.In my opinion, the resolution contains a number of essential points, but I would like to go into particular on the need for a stronger coordination between the European Union and the United Nations."	de
Secondly - and I am sure that the honorable MP recognizes this - and some of the tragic stories that came from Kosovo in recent weeks did not concern childish mortality during pregnancy, but child mortality after the birth of a healthy baby. These are cases of women who during hostilities, or before hostilities, tragically killed their own children. We are dealing with a horrifying story in Kosovo. We need to work as best as possible in the field of health care and in other areas in order to restore something that approaches civilized patterns and civilized behavior, but it is not going to be easy. Nl) Mr. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the answer you gave to the colleague's first question as well as the additional question. However, the information I have from my contacts in Kosovo reports that food packages that distribute, among other things, and Echo are often of inferior quality. Sometimes these foods contain insects and other impurities. Are you up to date on this situation? Are you prepared to take measures related to? This is the first supplementary question I wanted to ask you. My second question concerns your reference to the rebuilding of the hospital in Mitrovica. You will be aware that this hospital is in the northern part of the city and that, given the prevailing tension, the Albanians of Kosovo do not have access to it. How does the Commission intend to secure the access of Kosovo Albanians to hospitals? Regarding the first question, I will visit Kosovo himself again at the beginning of next month and I will certainly consider the accusation made by the honorable MP on the Echo food package. This is the first time I hear it, but it is an important point and I will definitely explore it when I am there. Secondly, I understand exactly what the honorable MP says about Mitrovica. I was in Mitrovica two months ago and saw myself the situation there. I had discussions with municipal lords from both communities, including the leader of the Albanian side, which has been a physician in the past and was generally recognized for the medical work he performed during the hostilities and then. Therefore, I am aware of the very serious problems that exist in this hospital and I can assure the Honorable MP that we will do everything we can in order to provide sufficient health means for everyone in Kosovo, from any ethnic group. Special problems in Mitrovica - are not e.g. The only issue of Albanian patients who find it difficult to access the hospital, but also of Albanian staff who already had trouble working there - are very serious. We will try to deal with them, but it's not easy. Question No.37 of K. (H-729/00): Subject: The exclusion of Armenia by Turkey, given that the European Union is currently actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Corporate Relations and Cooperation Agreement, which was signed on October 12, 1999, what measures does the Commission take?	el
The commission, for its part, is ready to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up - besides you might be among the first to blame us - to check the relevance and the quality of the programs that are offered to us.Second remark, the time to submission to programs and the possibility of presenting a programming complement jointly to the programs.I have no objections to this idea of ​​a submission of a complement of programming jointly to the main program.However, this cannot mean an extension of the main time.I remind you that it is six months for this program.This period, which is also identical to that which we have granted for Interreg and for the documents of objective 2, should generally be enough, it seems to me, to establish a program, which does not prohibit that the projects are defined later.I would like, about Urban, to conclude with a last reflection.One of you wanted this urban dimension to be summed up in Urban.I agree.I myself said to the meeting of ministers of development, territory and city, my concern - and I use it - that, in the documents, in the CCAs, in the programming for which we start negotiations, my concern, I say, that the urban dimension is found outside of Urban, in all the programs of objective 1 and of objective 2, and I think I can say our vigilance but also the translation of thisApart from Urban in all programming of structural funds.But for the future, since it is necessary to look in front of us, I am extremely concerned with seeing how Urban will, concretely, to work, also concerned with seeing the experiences or the lessons that we can learn, because obviously this urban dimension will be in the curled of what could be, for the next financial perspectives, a new policy of development of European territories.I do not forget, we cannot forget that 80 % of European citizens live today in cities and that is why this Urban instrument is extremely important.I say it and repeat, we will be attentive to the presence of the urban dimension in all the programming of structural funds.I would now like, Mr. President, to talk about Interreg and thank, as I did for Ms. Arlene McCarthy, your rapporteur, Mr. Francis Decourrière, for the quality and relevance of his work.He insisted on several points, on which we mark our agreement and many of you too: the importance of this transeuropian cooperation, with its three components, cross -border, transnational, interregional;Interreg's community added value, its readability compared to the general framework of structural funds, and the actual strengthening, transnational of eligible programs and operations;The importance of common structures - what I have called, about another debate that begins today, the intergovernmental conference, the common spirit of Europeans that we must strengthen, here, with Interreg and thanks to Interreg, how to strengthen the common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programs with real financial solidarity;The importance of the partnership to guarantee the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as associations of the private sector and socio-economic partners.	fr
"Finally, concerning large energy networks, the guidelines also provide for a financial participation of funds to the development of energy transport networks when it contributes to reducing dependence on an external supplier or to fight the effects of isolation.This is worth, in particular, for the region that I mentioned in the Azores, but also for all the ultraperipheral regions and I will also add for certain regions handicapped by isolation due to the mountains, for example.Mr. Commissioner, I hear your answer, but on the other hand, if I asked this question, it is that we are worried, precisely, since within the framework of the report on the third framework program of research, is a project called ""International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor"".It amounts to several billion ecus, obviously, and areas that can obtain structural funds like those classified in objective 1 would be likely to accommodate this kind of installation.What we would like to know is so indeed, as part of the installation of this research site, and not, perhaps directly in the specific ""nuclear research"" framework, the commission would be able to finance this kind of project.Mr. Barnier, excuse me, but you have not fully answered the last part of my question on the major energy transport networks.Could you provide an answer on this subject?Do you worry if, with the structural funds, we will finance the installation of nuclear power plants somewhere?I schematize.We could say that there is no question.I told you, Madam MP, that the selection of projects remains the spring of the Member States, according to the regulations of the structural funds.Consequently, commission services are not systematically informed of all selected projects.However, you do well to wonder, it's your job, and mine to answer you.As has already happened in the past, the Member States are led to answer, insofar as the Commission questions or requests them.So, I will go a little further than the confidence usually shared between the Member States and the Commission, and on the precise point that you mention I will see exactly what it is.The Member State, or the Member States concerned, will then be brought to answer me and I will transmit this answer immediately.It seemed to me to have answered the question of major networks.The energy situation is extremely variable according to the regions of the European Union, and the help of funds, in certain cases and for certain regions, could be justified, in the case where the connection to the basic energy networks is still underdeveloped.This is the answer I can make on this connection between the major energy transport networks and the structural funds.I call question nº 46 of (H-0052/00): Subject: structural funds and additionality in light of the recently useful response brought by the commission to my priority written question relating to structural funds and additionality, I would like to know if the Commission plans to have the regulations change in addition.Would the Commission be in particular favorable to a modification of this regulation in the direction of the application of additionality, not only at the level of the Member States but also within them, being the applicable budgetary provisions between national authorities and regions or countries enjoying internal autonomy?"	fr
The identification of genetically modified additives plays a particularly important role here.On the one hand, it allows the farmer to consciously decide whether he wants to use such animal foods or not and it allows, on the other hand, the consumer to refuse foods that have been produced from GMOs.Finally, again, a big thank you for our group to the rapporteur, who gave himself a lot of trouble.I think we can be impatient to know Mr. Byrne's response.Mr. President, dear colleagues, this report is more for formal questions, namely how it is necessary to approve additives, and to a lesser extent, what additives it is and how they work.I must seize this opportunity to underline how important it is that all guidelines of this kind are processed, in the future, according to the procedure provided for in article 152, since food security and environmental issues require a coherent policy, a global perspective.We cannot continue, as we have done so far, to deal with every detail in the spot, and very often when harmful consequences have already occurred.The rapporteur has emphasized the experiences and labeling which the GMOs contained in the additives used in animal feed must be subject.I would like to evoke the question of antibiotics once again.Admittedly, five of the nine types of antibiotics whose addition to animal feed was initially authorized are now prohibited, but it is extremely important that the four remaining types are prohibited.Not only in the name of public health, but also for the good of the animals concerned.We are today at the stage where we know the formidable threat that antibiotic resistance represents for human health, especially for young children.Many Member States are already able to prove how the abusive employment of antibiotics in breeding is superfluous.Several countries have long eliminated this practice, a number of other countries are in the process of doing so, with positive results.Regarding antibiotics, it has been a long time since we went to the famous precautionary principle.In terms of environment, there is, however, another important principle, namely the principle of exchange.I would like to briefly mention the question of coccidiostatic.It is a technical antibiotic, which is not absolutely necessary.There are replacement methods.It is possible to vaccinate the chickens.It certainly costs a little more, but is without consequences for the environment.Today, we spread the slurry containing coccidiostatic on the fields, which goes into water, that is to say in the most important component of our diet.Mr. President, the Commissioner, my dear colleagues, the report on additives in animal feed relates to a technical-economic problem to restore competitive balance between different additives in animal food and between producers of these additives.But today, after the serious crisis of dioxin which struck Belgium and other European countries last summer, we cannot be content to reflect on a simple question of competition.Indeed, in its time, even if it has gone more unnoticed by the general public, the scientific experts of the commission had discovered in citrus pulp imported from the Brazil of industrial residues of lime laden with dioxin.	fr
Inaugurating an unfinished building in the middle of an election campaign, which could not be occupied eight months after the inauguration, has greatly ridicked the Spanish government.That the Spanish government has ridiculed me does not worry me because, in the end, it is responsible for it but that the commission was ridiculed by giving its approval, by its presence, to this inconvenient conduct, that worries me.This is why I ask you, Mr. Commissioner: does it seem normal that an unfinished building was inaugurated in the middle of the electoral campaign?Does it seem normal that the commission has given its approval, by its presence, to this inconvenient conduct of the Spanish government?It is not for me to comment on the internal political situation of one or the other Member State.I would therefore like to abstain from any comments on the situation that Mr. Berenguer has just mentioned.I must admit that the reason why an inauguration ceremony is set up in Spain escapes me.I can tell you that I hope that now, this building will come into office as quickly as possible.Let me add that I hope to be present in Alicante myself at the end of May in order to speak during a conference.I hope this building will then have come into office.I would like to tell the commissioner that it is not an electoral question.As members of the Legal Commission and the internal market, we followed the subject of the creation of this institution and, obviously, it is clear that this building was inaugurated for electoral reasons.Today - a year later - it is still unoccupied, which means that the commission spends money for a false inauguration.It should be asked to what extent this expenditure of funds for a false inauguration was justified.Again, the Commission does not deal with the considerations underlying the actions of the Member States.The commission takes care of what is officially declared and what is done.We do not intend to engage in what is called a trial of intention.We therefore take care of public and official acts and affairs and not any underlying reasons.This is why it seems difficult to me to satisfy Mr. Medina on this point and to answer his question.Again, the Commission does not wonder why something takes place more or less late, apart from the fact that the Commission attaches a price to the fact that a building such as that planned for this office is inaugurated and used as quickly as possible.In addition, the Commission does not take care either because of whether determined expenses are real or virtual.Regarding, all expenses are real.For the rest, it is the future that will tell us.Question nº 54 of (H-0117/00): Subject: monopoly of alcohol and internal market What measures does the commission intend to prevent Sweden from maintaining, as it obviously has the intention, its monopoly of state of alcohol and therefore, restrictions on the corresponding imports, so as to thus make the rules of the internal market prevail?	fr
"The fishermen's ices in Europe are faced with serious problems, and the well -being of the industry is really important to me.I therefore call on the Commission and the Council to collect the necessary information and to raise the political will for truly long -term solutions for the communities dependent on fishing and not to strive for short -term solutions.I recommend the report to the high house.The environmental committee is generally satisfied with the communication of the Commission, and we are pleased that the fishing committee has taken over our changes.In the meantime, it is widely recognized that the fishing has an impact on the sea environment, which go far beyond the mere fishing of the target type plus a little by catch and can be felt everywhere.We welcome the Commission's intention to include environmental protection in other policy areas - also in the common fishing policy - to the EU.After all, the contracts have been in the contracts since 1992 that the principle of prevention and environmental protection should be integrated into the community policies.However, as has already been determined, the adoption of a strict definition of the principle of prevention is of crucial importance, because mere lip service is all too easy and then continued ""business as usual"".In this context, a good example would be the UN Convention on Fish stocks from 1995. However, one aspect is missing in the message, namely monitoring and control.All reasonable measures and regulations will not lead to inventory if there is no effective system that ensures compliance with the rules.The Member States is responsible for control.A list of serious violations has recently been accepted by the Council, with which attempts are made to coordinate the punishment of similar offenses in the different countries to a certain extent.This is an important step forward, but commission and committee for fishing constantly point out that a lot of improvements are still necessary in the control programs of all Member States.I would like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent report.President!Fishing is an economic activity of the first rank, behind which there are very high investments and offers the entire regions of the community their basic employment under really hard conditions.But the idea that some people have from fishing is usually extremely simple and can range from pure folklore to the insult to see the fisherman as a insensitive pirate and looter.Unfortunately, I have to say that this report was apparently an opportunity for people with this kind of ideas for its connection with the environment to bring in their special nonsense.If Mr. Katiforis' report had been accepted in its original version, no member of the fishing committee could ever have put his foot in a fishing region again without having a certain risk.The relationship between fishing and sea ecosystems is obvious.But this relationship is much more comprehensive and includes many factors, such as pollution and maritime traffic.Only accusing the fisherman because of the environmental destruction is as unjust as it is wrong.Our committee prevented his own shame through a number of amendments, of which I myself brought 14, which were largely accepted by the rapporteur, for which I sincerely thank him."	de
"Besides, this is particularly sensitive because it is a protection of the community's financial interests, as the rapporteur Theato said very well. We are all aware of it - and the Parliament has brought up this concern or been a real leading character - that the financial benefits of the community must be protected. However, let us be alert and, as the French say, ""those jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du Bain"" (Let's not throw the child away with the wash water). In other words, in the protection of the financial interests of the community, on the one hand, a respectable - and rapporteur, Theato said - the powers of the Member States, but also other matters that affect citizens and necessary guarantees. They completely safeguard the conclusions of the Theato report. Thus, I hope as chairman of the Committee on Legal and Internal Market Affairs and, of course, a member of the Parliament, that the widespread majority of Parliament will support the report tomorrow and that the Commission will implement it well. Mr President, as a member of the Parliament Theato said, this is a critical report. It is a report proposed by the Committee on Committee on the Committee on Committee on Committee on Committee on Committee on Budget. One of the reasons we wanted so eagerly to draw up this report was that the European Union is associated with fraud and bad administration, whether we want it or not. It is sometimes exaggerated, but so it is. We have to do something about it. Some Member States have not followed some of the actions we have introduced - and let's not forget that the Member States are implemented by about 80 % of the EU budget. Many of them have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Economic Benefits, and so it was clearly forced to do something more radical. We need to take seriously this task. We must be able to prosecute those persons who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who puts them in the prosecution? Real difficulties start here. Who is the task when it comes to an organ that extends across so many boundaries? We also need to take into account the concerns of the Member States. The proposal for the establishment of the European General Prosecutor's Office is very sensitive. We are all aware that the everyday federalist approach and the situation where the European law of law takes precedence over national judicial authorities is too much. However, the discussion must begin, and so we ask HVK to start the discussions. Parliament considers the European Union's budget to be very important about how to deal with persons working in the European Union's institutions. Now that we look at the entire reform process, it is absolutely important that we convey the right message. People need to understand that if they commit fraud, they are prosecuted and this is not the case at the moment. Palacio, a member of Parliament, looked at the question of whether we should have a legal authority. I would like to make it clear that my group intends to submit a review to remove the detail how the Commission should address this question. We are aware that the matter is sensitive. We know that the Commission perhaps needs room for maneuver to negotiate a solution that all parties can accept. I just would like to make it clear that we do not commit to a Corpus juro and do not to the general prosecutor of the federalist Europe. However, we are clearly committed to changing the current situation that is in no way accepted. Mr President, I would like to start by thanking the Member of Parliament Theato for his report. I think the report is excellent and that my group is mostly supported. I just have a strong feeling that at this point he really wanted to go a little further. After listening to discussions in the last five or six months, this could have been the case."	fi
We tend to believe that this economic growth of the Union has a solid basis, now and for the coming years, and that we must not lose sight of the fact that we are in an open, global and very competitive economy.If we want to match the leadership of the United States, or even take over, we must avoid interventionism initially proposed by Mr. Katiforis, to avoid any excessive intervention on the part of the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures.In addition, the Member States refused to grant more resources during discussions on the 2000 agenda, so that in the European Union level, we will have only few means in the coming years.On the other hand, we insist on the need to continue to deepen the construction of the European domestic market, which still has serious shortcomings.In certain sectors, such as those of air transport, energy or telecommunications, the costs borne by our companies are still very high if we compare unit costs to those of the United States or other countries also competitive at the international level.The report contains information specifying that the bureaucratic cost for the creation of a new company is 500 euros in the United States when it is on average 1,600 euros in the European Union.There is therefore always an excessive bureaucracy and an excessive intervention.We believe that it is by respecting the rigor agreements which are established with the programs which follow the stability pact and by deepening the creation of a market with fewer obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness necessary for the European Union.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the passion that my predecessors recognized to Mr. Katiforis had, in my ears, no other objective than to call the European Parliament to meet the hope of tens of millions of unemployed, excluded and precarious in our European Union.It is this objective to which he called the European Parliament: to give hope to the peoples of Europe.There is economic recovery, of course, but it only marginally retreats unemployment in Europe.The voices of the PPE-DE and Liberals very strongly led to, even inverted, the meaning of his message.This is the reason why we have not voted the report as it was amended by them, despite our efforts, and we will not vote it in the current state.What are the minimum conditions we would vote for this report.First, the assertion that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, respectful in particular of the commitments of the European Union to the conferences of Kyoto and Buenos Aires.There are enormous tasks to be performed to keep our commitments by the 2008 fateful year where we should have returned to greenhouse gas clearances at the 1990 level. Huge works are to be carried out in the field of transport, the energy saving, and even to substitute travel by internet communications.	fr
