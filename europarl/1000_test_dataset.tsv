In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be. That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist. The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign. Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments. I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds. I can perform this dual task. I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ. Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties. Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin. I have already appeared before the French Senate. Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too. With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication. I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion. I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate. Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with. It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself. In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting. Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes? It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments. Can such matters be controlled from Brussels? Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning?	fr
These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy. This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court. Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references. This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union. The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning. In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system. Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice. Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service. In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve. However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here. For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law. I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level. It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions. We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind. Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance. In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance.	it
"If this is the role that the Commission intends to play over the next five years, we federalists are convinced, we are certain that this is not the right path to take and we shall send for you and judge what the Commission intends to do in this regard. The reform is important but, if it aggravates the situation, reduces or weakens the supranational powers of the Commission, then the structure of European integration, as planned by the founding fathers for the European Commission, will be at risk. As for the other points, Mr Prodi, I will take economic and social policy as an example: the European social model is certainly experiencing a major crisis and it is certainly not coincidental that unemployment tops the list of problems that none of our policies has managed to resolve, but it is not certain that it can be resolved by going through a list of problems that we have discussed in the past, without having a clear idea or proposal which takes note of the fact that Europe contains economies that are growing at some of the most sustainable rates and that it is not by chance that these are the economies which have made labour market flexibility and enterprise their prime objective. If we continue to get bogged down with proposals that have given extremely poor results so far, I do not know what we or the Commission will be able to do. The same goes for enlargement as an end in itself, without it being linked to a reform to make the European Union and its structures much more efficient, and to proposals that the Commission could have made at the IGC. Mr Prodi, there is one positive thing that I would like to say to you, perhaps contrary to the opinion of some Members, regarding the telegram that you sent to the Austrian Government. We approve of your position on this: you did well not to isolate that country any further. In any case, we shall see what specific steps transpire when the time comes for practical action. Mr Prodi, I repeat that this is, in our opinion, a slightly short-sighted view. Above all, it lacks drive in the sectors I have mentioned, for example, as regards the Balkans. Can we really continue to leave the Balkans out of the enlargement process, disregarding the fact that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to a place in this House that is open to all? Madam President, Mr Prodi, I should like to applaud your proposal for a radical decentralisation of the Union' s activities and ask why, then, you are proposing a legislative programme which would lead to centralisation. I remember your predecessor' s speech five years ago. Like yourself, he promised ""less and better"" , but Mr Santer finished up by having delivered ""much more and much worse"" , and I do not believe that you, either, can deliver the goods you promise. You talk about decentralisation but practise centralisation. The legislative programme is, in fact, a litany of subjects over which the people are to be deprived of influence and in connection with which, Mr Prodi, you are to take influence away from the people, even on social questions."	es
Fourthly, a point which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen stressed just now, the promotion of an equal opportunities policy for women and young people. Fifthly, the importance and role of small and medium-sized businesses. Mr Vatanen expressed this most forcefully just now. Finally, the positive effects on national administrations of the system of management of the Structural Funds, the motives of officials in managing these funds, even if it is occasionally complicated, and the importance of once again making improvements to the procedures for the evaluation, follow-up and supervision of the Commission. In relation to this, I must inform the European Parliament of my intention to organise halfway through the year 2000 a seminar with national and regional authorities on this question of the evaluation of procedures for the exchange of good practice in the management of Structural Funds. I should like to mention a few specific points. Mr Berend, you expressed a wish that zoning should be implemented quickly. Well, we are coming to an end of the zoning phase. Tomorrow, the Commission is to decide on the matter for four more countries and very soon, I hope, it will be Italy' s turn. You may therefore be satisfied on this point, since zoning will have been completed for all the countries affected by Objective 2. Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistics on this subject are dependent on the reliability of data and, as Mr Cocilovo mentioned, there is clearly a problem with the reliability of this data. To a certain extent, they are taken into account in the statistics on GDP and labour force surveys and, in any case, I wish to point out the efforts which Eurostat is making and shall continue to make in order to improve the quality of the statistics. Mr Berend, you also mentioned, as did Mr Aparicio Sánchez, the lack of reform in the fisheries sector. On this point which is of personal interest to me, let me remind you that the small scale of this sector - and this does not necessarily mean that it is an insignificant area - and its concentration in a limited number of regions do not make it easy to analyse in a regional context. This type of sectoral analysis pertains rather to the practice and competence of the Directorate General for Fisheries, under Commissioner Fischler. Nonetheless, I must assure you that the Commission will make every effort to include an analysis of this type in the second report on cohesion which, no doubt, will respond better to these concerns. Several of you mentioned points which must be included in the second report on cohesion, and your rapporteur mentioned some of these. I wish to assure you, firstly, that the merging of the periodic reports and the report on cohesion should not entail any loss of information or loss of interest as regards the content of the report on cohesion which is, as far as I am concerned, Mr Berend, an extremely important instrument, not only to provide information on what has been achieved in a transparent and rigorous manner, so that future guidelines may be examined or evaluated, but also to create a public debate involving the citizens of Europe and, furthermore, with the elected representatives, i.e. yourselves, on the subject of this regional policy and what might one day be a European regional planning policy.	fr
What criteria will the Commission use to approve or reject the Member States' programmes? Which Community body will control the funding of the steering group and the monitoring committee and verify that the programme is carried out exactly and correctly? The European Social Fund contribution for the period 2000-2006 will total 2 487 billion euro. As the EQUAL initiative is a joint funding venture with the Member States, what will Greece's contribution amount to? The EQUAL initiative is not restricted to certain groups of people. Its purpose is to combat discrimination in the workplace. The decision on this initiative was taken in Berlin, where it was decided to take account of professional groups of asylum seekers and to include them in its action. This is an important aspect of this initiative. The Community initiative programme in each Member State must comply with the regulation. This is the same as the Social Fund regulation, i.e. EQUAL comes under the Social Fund regulation. It has been submitted to Parliament and we expect Parliament' s opinion next month. I should like to stress that the EQUAL initiative satisfies national requirements and national plans defined in accordance with agreed European strategy. The Member States, i.e. the national governments, have primary responsibility for setting up the joint agencies, submitting proposals, selecting the proposals which the programmes will implement and carrying out primary control. Within the European Commission, the Directorate-General for Employment is responsible for implementation, while financial control is the responsibility of the Directorate-General for Financial Control, the Anti-Fraud Office and the European Court of Auditors. The last question concerns the amount granted. Greece has been granted ECU 98 million. The contribution commitment is 80%, rising to an 85% contribution from the initiative for the island regions, especially the remote Greek islands, and a contribution by Greece of 15%. Mr President, I feel that the guidelines for the Community EQUAL initiative, especially the four actions described in it, will result both in complicated bureaucracy and, paradoxically, a non-transparent structure. For example, one wonders how a development partnership will prove its cooperative spirit or its representative capacity, as required by action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines. At the same time, the obligation to engage in transnational cooperation, the complicated demands of the plan and the implementation of a development partnership inevitably require large structures, as these are the only structures which can meet such demands. However, this contradicts the stated aim of the general objectives for decentralised action plans at the level of local authorities and rural areas. However, at the same time, participation by those actually discriminated against, such as asylum seekers, immigrants and so on, is rendered impossible or merely symbolic. Finally, if you consider the overall amount, which is on the small side, - EUR 2.8 billion for 15 Member States - and how ambitious the objectives are, I am afraid that all we shall succeed in doing is to prove that unemployment is a bad thing. First let me say that it would be a great help to us, now that we have reached the stage where this is being processed by Parliament, if you could make specific proposals which we could take into account.	de
I appreciate the fact that Parliament has proved to be flexible over the very sensitive and difficult question of imposing charges for water services. I can wholeheartedly support the demand that the price of water should be set at a level which creates incentives to use water resources in a sustainable way. I also support the demand for a suitable contribution from each sector to cover own costs. I can therefore partly, and in principle, approve Amendments Nos 43-46, together with Amendment No 85. I believe that we need legally binding requirements stating that the financial costs of water services are to be covered by each economic sector. This would constitute a clear goal against which progress could be measured. I therefore support the overall thrust of Amendment No 105, which is in line with the Commission' s original proposal. I also support a gradual development in the direction of covering environmental costs and the costs of resources. We are aware of the fact that the price of water and water services is a complicated issue and that account must be taken not only of environmental goals but also of social and economic goals. This must not, however, be an excuse for subsidising inefficient economic sectors which cause pollution. We intend shortly to issue a communication from the Commission on precisely this question. I agree with Parliament that the common position' s sixteen-year timeframe for implementing these measures must be considerably reduced. The same also applies to the possibility which exists of extending the period of implementation by a further eighteen years. Amendment No 28, cancelling the third extension period, is an important step in the right direction. This proposal can therefore be approved. A period of ten years, as proposed in Amendments Nos 24 and 26, among others, is, on the other hand, too short. I believe that consideration ought to be given to wording the overall definition of the requirements under the proposal in such a way that it includes a strict and explicit condition to the effect that causing deterioration of the environment must be avoided. The proposal must also include more stringent criteria for establishing lesser environmental objectives and for extending deadlines in connection with heavily modified or artificial bodies of water. This applies to Amendments Nos 6, 24, 25, 27, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 78, 80, 102 and 104. These Amendments may in large part be approved and will be supported until such time as an overall solution can be found. To comply with the demands in Amendments Nos 27 and 29, to the effect that the Commission should approve every extension, would be going too far, and these cannot be approved. Another important area is protection of the groundwater. We need both a starting point and a final goal if we are to reverse the upward trend in pollution. We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring. The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle. The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose. I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution. Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater.	de
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the European Parliament has rightly led the way in promoting human rights in the European Union. Clearly, governments are often more sensitive to the interests of realpolitik and to commercial, geostrategic or economic interests. We have established requirements for the countries which want to join our Union and we must also establish requirements for the countries which we support, because we believe in democracy and its values. A free press and informed public opinion are the heart and soul of a democracy. There can be no democracy without freedom of information and without free and informed public opinion. Yet the latter cannot exist without free and unrestricted social communication which itself cannot exist when journalists are persecuted, detained, threatened or put under pressure. We rightfully condemned the behaviour of UNITA which threatened the peace process in Angola and we used our authority to invite the two sides to stop the war and embrace peace. Rightfully and with the full weight of our authority, we condemn the persecution and threats against journalists and we call on the Government of Angola to ensure the conditions of freedom which are essential to the vital work of journalists in a democratic country and society. Mr President, how much longer can we continue our cooperation with Angola? Human rights are being violated consistently and have been for a long period of time, not only by UNITA, but also by the government itself. The legal proceedings against the journalists fly in the face of every legal principle. The Angolan Government must immediately authorise a substantial UN presence which can mediate and can report on human rights. Additionally, European observers will need to be admitted to the trials against the journalists. Europe, as a major donor, has so far remained too passive with regard to Angola. If the Angolan Government continues to refuse to cooperate, measures will need to be taken. Without national reconciliation, reconciliation with Europe is not possible. This being the case, Angola will unfortunately remain a very rough diamond. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I fully support the motion for a resolution being discussed by this House. The repression of both Angolan and foreign journalists in Angola is scandalous and so serious that we cannot let it pass without comment. However, this motion is inadequate as it actually starts from the principle that Angola enjoys rule of law and is only imposing certain restrictions on journalists and restraining them. Yet this is not the situation. Angola does not enjoy rule of law. It is a repressive dictatorship. It is at war, and a bloody war at that, which is dragging on and on. The prevalent theory that the enemy must be crushed and physically eliminated to achieve peace is not one which we can accept. The repeated appeals made by the Angolan church and, for example, by Mr Mandela and Mr Mbeki, for new negotiations to try and achieve peace must be supported by this House. As another Member said, we must have a general debate on Angola and not just on the situation of certain journalists suffering repression in this country.	fr
The funding approved by the Council for the cultural programme does not do justice to the importance of cultural and educational policy and of this programme to the European Union' s goals. Cultural activity creates identity. Cultural activity is an expression of individuality, of an individual' s own personality; it builds relationships and communicates. We want a colourful Europe. We want a Europe based on the principle of diversity within unity. We want people to understand and learn to appreciate differences. That is why we spoke in favour of breaking down the budget, the allocation of funds that is, into the different types of measure. That is why we opposed concentrating heavily on large networks and network structures, because we want to promote the small and medium-sized entities and activities performed by individuals; because we want to see thousands of flowers bloom. I would like to second what the previous speaker had to say. There is a contradiction in terms - unanimity principle, codecision procedure, and Conciliation Committee - and it is one we must resolve if we want to strengthen, and not further weaken the principles of cultural policy that are to create a European consciousness. Madam President, as we have heard, all the groups have a common political enemy in the Council. It is not by chance that the Committee on Culture' s decisions are constantly ending up in the conciliation procedure, for one or other Member State in the Council always holds culture hostage to other interests. In this way, the unanimity principle has shown itself to be a blockading instrument of the first order. The battle for a workable compromise lasted almost two years, and now, at long last, the European Parliament can give the go-ahead. The Council could not be moved, not even when the precursor programmes Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael finished. A pilot programme was called for to bridge the gap. This showed up the weaknesses of the European Union' s cultural policy activities once again. The political fight over funding and programme structuring is out of all proportion to the volume of support. Out of 410 applications in 1999 only 55 projects with a low overall volume of EUR 6.07 million could be considered. The Council was not prepared in the case of this particular programme to accommodate Parliament to the tune of even a single euro! And so the moderate sum of 167 million will stand until 2004. That is the same as a single, medium-sized, German opera house' s expenditure over the same period, when here in Europe this sum has been earmarked for 29 countries over a period of five years! There is a blatant discrepancy here! And so we are going to have to be content, albeit very grudgingly, with the fact that we have at least managed to achieve something in terms of content. Previous speakers have already kindly pointed this out. We can only hope that it will, after all, be possible to persuade the Council to have a change of heart one day.	es
This would put more jobs at risk and also put at risk the credibility of this House by showing how remote we are from the real world. I therefore urge this House to reject the full report and let the original Commission proposal, which was very well-balanced, stand unamended. Mr President, we are unable to vote for this report. The European Union should actually place social issues at the heart of the building of Europe. Social rights should determine economic choices, and not the other way around. This is why, when it comes to social protection, we are opposed to schemes copied from the Luxembourg process which run counter to this rationale: broad economic guidelines, then convergence criteria and, finally, social issues, dealt with as the last resort. The European Union should proclaim one general principle, to wit, that the social rights acquired in Member States may not be restricted. Any Community intervention should aim to complement and to harmonise existing guarantees according to the highest common denominator. In order to strengthen the funding of social security systems, we need a policy of general wage increase, the establishment of a minimum legal wage in each Member State. In order to fight poverty, entitlement to an income and to employment are inalienable rights. Finally, in order to avoid health being treated in any way as a commodity, the European Union should declare itself clearly opposed to pension funds and to a situation where private insurance companies have access to the health system. I sincerely hope, in conclusion, that social Europe cannot be satisfied with mere words and pious hopes. For millions of people the situation is too tragic for that. Mr President, Commissioner, the aim of developing a coordinated strategy for modernising social protection in the European Union is certainly an admirable one. Just as the launching of a European convergence strategy on employment and labour market policies at the Luxembourg Summit was commendable. The labour market and social protection are, in fact, two sides of the same coin, that require harmonised policies and rules. If the labour market functions by means of certain levels of employment, flexibility and salary discipline, then it is impossible for the welfare state and social protection not to function, and vice versa. Until recently, the European countries fixed, it could be said in an autarkic way, the rules governing the functioning and financing of the two markets. Budgetary and exchange rate policies were responsible for maintaining internal and external stability. With the Maastricht Treaty and the single currency, budgetary discipline became tighter and recourse to devaluation ceased as a means of endeavouring to restore marginal competitiveness. The structural and economic differences of the various countries cannot, therefore, be rebalanced through budget deficits and trade. That being the case, in the absence of complete labour mobility inside the Union, and without a redistributive fiscal policy at federal level, it is left to the labour markets and welfare systems to provide what degree of flexibility there is to remedy both structural and economic disequilibria, the so-called exogenous asymmetric shocks.	fr
In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President. These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union. The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip. Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America. Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region. However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki. I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them. The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago. Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent. These were essentially of three types which I will describe. The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management. The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations. This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment. I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events. Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council. Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union. I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch.	it
These are the reasons why the guidelines are presented according to thematic priorities, since they must be taken into consideration, under each of the objectives, to different extents in accordance with the specific situations of each of the Member States and regions. I should now like to respond briefly to a few of the comments you have made, ladies and gentlemen, and firstly on procedure. It is true that consultation with Parliament has only come about at a late date. Let me remind you that when the guidelines were adopted by the Commission, in the form of a draft in February 1999, in line with a new procedure intended to make it easier to present comments on this text, my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, presented them to Parliament immediately. Due to the elections to the European Parliament taking place around this time, however, Parliament was not able to undertake its examination of these guidelines until after the text had been definitively adopted, in July 1999. Here in this Chamber, ladies and gentlemen, among you, I wish to assure you that in the negotiations for the programmes which are only just beginning - Mr Hatzidakis asked me a question about this - as far as Member States are concerned, your observations will certainly be taken into consideration. And let me assure you, furthermore, that when the Commission adopts the guidelines with what we call the mid-term review in mind, in line with the regulations, then the point of view of this House, as expressed in this report, will also be taken into account. Now to the form. On the subject of the role of the guidelines, Mrs Schroedter, you pointed out that this is the context in which guidelines on a number of European objectives, often very precise ones, should be provided. I shall not list them all, but they include implementing intersectoral policies, increasing efficiency in the use of public funds, assisting the various partners in drawing up regional or national programming together, etc. The Commission takes note of these, but several of these guidelines or these questions are related more to other documents, such as the Guide to the Reform of the Structural Funds or the methodological working document. Drawing to a close, I should like to focus on a number of challenges which you reiterated, Mrs Schroedter. I am thinking, for example, of the idea that these guidelines are not specific enough in their recommendations. This claim that your report makes must be seen in the context of last spring' s negotiations. The Commission kept to the actual text of Article 10 of the Structural Funds regulations, which stipulates that the aim of these guidelines is to provide Member States with broad, indicative guidelines on relevant and agreed Community policies. I actually quoted the text itself, in quotation marks. Moreover, the guidelines may not substitute for the programming or the ex ante assessments which must be the tool used to specify priorities and the effectiveness of these programmes. You then mentioned, Mrs Schroedter, the section of the guidelines relating to urban and rural development, pointing out that urban development was not sufficiently taken into consideration.	fr
We will certainly raise the point made by the honourable Member. We have heard anxieties expressed on that point and I will ensure it is taken up. There have also been considerable anxieties expressed about the potential danger to the archaeological heritage in the area. We will raise that, too, in the representations we make. A number of other hydro-electric schemes planned over the last 30 years in Turkey have raised matters of concern, such as the effect on displaced farmers. On the whole those seem to have been dealt with relatively satisfactorily and I hope that the same can be true of this project which - just to make the point clear - is not a project in which the Commission is participating in any form. Question No 39 by (H-0036/00): Subject: Drafting of Charter of Fundamental Rights The general public welcomes the fact that a Charter of Fundamental Rights is to be drawn up. It is also to be hoped that it will meet the challenges of Europe in the 21st century. What are the Commission's views on the substance of the Charter? What type of rights will the Charter set out (economic, social and cultural)? Which citizens will it cover (those of the European Union or the citizens of all European countries with a view to enlargement? Will it cover immigrants etc.?) Will it set out established social rights in the European Union or will it set a broader agenda? What means will the Charter use to ensure that it clearly guarantees equality between the sexes? What are the Commission's views on incorporating the Charter into the Treaty on European Union? Like the honourable Member, the Commission welcomes the decision taken by the Heads of State and Government to start the process of drawing up a European Charter of Fundamental Rights. In the conclusions of the Cologne European Council the Heads of State and Government even established the broad outlines of the Charter' s content. According to these conclusions, the Charter must contain three categories of rights. The first category is rights of freedom and equality and procedural rights, as guaranteed by the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms. The second is the rights reserved for citizens of the European Union. The third is economic and social rights, as contained in the European Social Charter and the Community Charter of the Fundamental Social Rights of Workers, insofar as they do not merely establish objectives for action by the Union. The Commission considers that the Convention responsible for drawing up the Charter of Fundamental Rights must respect the mandate given by the Cologne European Council. Having said that, this does not mean that the Convention should be limited to a codifying role of simply compiling the existing rights from various sources. As I have said before in this House, the Commission is convinced that the Convention must be able, if necessary, to adapt and develop these rights in view of current circumstances, particularly technological and social changes.	fr
That is absolutely crucial. It should also be remembered, however, that no one voluntarily relinquishes power, and that applies to both men and women. Men have never wished to surrender positions of power when they had them, but there are also very few women who have been willing to give up their positions of power, and I am thinking here, in particular, of positions of power in relation to children. Moreover, I would also say that this may also be one of the reasons why there are so few men here today. Inevitably, we should like, for the same reasons of power politics, to be allowed to have this debate more or less to ourselves. What I want to emphasise by saying this is that it is a matter of both sides' surrendering power. The Commissioner emphasised that what is needed is a very broadly-based political mix, and she specifically mentioned Finland and Sweden. Just for the record, I would say that she might well also have mentioned Denmark. And I say that, of course, because I come from Denmark. In fact, 45% of the Danish government is made up of women, and that is, in reality, a touch more than in Finland. We still do not have a female president but, on the other hand, we have a queen, and that must no doubt, in certain contexts, amount to the same thing. I should like to broach some of the points the Commissioner mentioned, notably the question of financial resources. It is crucial we accept that there is a price to pay if women are to have equality in the short term. In the short term, we also need to invest in making sure that children are properly cared for and, of course, also properly educated. The issue is therefore one of appropriate structures. One might well wonder if traditional industrial culture has been a particularly good thing, and I am therefore very happy that the Portuguese ministers are to participate very actively in the Lisbon Summit, which is, of course, to be partly concerned with IT developments. I think that this field offers some quite distinctive opportunities for women, specifically because it is characterised by flat, rather than hierarchical, structures. In Denmark, we have, in any case, seen developments to suggest that quite a lot of women entrepreneurs are on the way up. There are two points which have not been seriously mentioned and which I should just like to mention here finally. The first is the issue of the media' s influence. I think it is very important that we should investigate what kind of stereotypes the media establish. Do we have a special problem in this regard? I have to say that I do not know the precise answer to that question. I have a suspicion that this is the case, but I am not certain. The second point is the enlargement of the Union. I think it very important that we should emphasise straight away that a number of demands are to be made in connection with enlargement as well, specifically that the new Member States should arrange to be represented by both men and women so that in that way they are improving the status of women in the countries concerned. I would also like to thank the Minister and the Commissioner for their statements and I agree with the Commissioner' s statement; it is time that fine words were translated into action.	fr
I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament? Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made. Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes. However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas. Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities. I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields. I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects. I should be very grateful, Mrs Schroedter, if you would actually include this proposed amendment in the part relating to subsidiarity in your positive deliberations. Mr President, Commissioner, in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, we upheld unanimously the criterion that it was of strategic importance and a matter of priority to support the interventions of the Structural and Cohesion Funds which are working for a better opportunity for jobs for the unemployed and for equality between men and women. Unfortunately, the excellent Schroedter report did not take account of this criterion, despite the fact that there is considerable evidence to show - as we shall see later in the Berend report - how, in fact, these funds are providing splendid assistance to the most backward regions in order to bridge the gulf that separates them from Europe' s most highly-developed regions. They are growing, but only in terms of GDP. They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions. Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem. Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require. Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy.	es
I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment. This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States. This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE. Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community. Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage. LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States. I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies. This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds. Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union. For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion. Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice. The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those. Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds. A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	it
Mr President, we need to take an important decision today. Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer? No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50. It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work. Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment. Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45. The common position stipulates 2006. According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations. I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists. If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply. The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic. This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer. For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener. Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries. That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45. We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position. Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area. With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it. If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive. This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it. It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted. For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply. The polluter should pay. This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles. There must be rules governing existing vehicles too. Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force. There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead. We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations.	de
This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate. Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector. Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that. Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force. Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic. The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling. The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road. This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses. Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection. Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision. Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry? The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake. It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection! The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive! The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation. In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more. This is totally unacceptable. I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today! The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive.	fr
But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation. They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation. I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001. I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support. Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process. The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support. Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed. These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from. The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union. We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States. If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security. It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda. In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence. As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies. It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives. It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy. We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern. National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty.	de
That is why a ceiling needs to be set for administrative expenditure. The committee based its conclusions on these critical comments. We attached particular importance to linking the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and excluded people in the social sector, in tourism and in small and medium-sized enterprises with promoting the establishment of new small and medium-sized businesses bearing in mind the necessary economic structural change. Dovetailing the activities under the Community initiative with the European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a crucial prerequisite for attaining the objectives of the EQUAL programme. We fully support the innovative approach towards setting up development partnerships and organising the exchange of experience at European level as an integral part of the EQUAL programme. The specific target of deriving European added value brings the regional cooperation up to European level while retaining the cooperation of the various regional operators. This is a good approach and that is why we have also supported it. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, it has already been mentioned today that the first URBAN initiative was an unqualified success. The fact that this initiative will now be continued in the form of URBAN II, albeit with a smaller budget, is something for which we have to thank individual, committed Members of this Parliament, including in particular - as far as I have heard as a new Member of this Parliament - the rapporteur Mrs McCarthy, whom I should therefore like to thank very much for her dedication and of course also for her report on URBAN II. A new feature of the URBAN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities. This is important because it is precisely small cities which often find it harder to access aid. And yet the problems which give rise to the urgent need for regeneration can be particularly acute precisely in cities of this kind and thus have a proportionally adverse effect. To increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 50. I think that it is important not to stick rigidly to this arbitrary quantitative restriction and instead to leave it to the Member States to decide between how many projects they each wish to divide the support funds to which they are entitled. In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support. There URBAN II would only be a drop in the ocean; its success would be doubtful and the whole thing would be a flop. Just as important in my view is not to broaden the selection criteria for URBAN II too much and thus water them down. It is precisely a strictly defined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are funded are to be models and be transferable to other problem cities in the future. From my own experience of local government in an old industrialised region beset with problems, I should like, in conclusion, to ask for your particular support, ladies and gentlemen, for two points in the report which alongside the social policy aspects are, I believe, essential. Firstly, environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding. Secondly, preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level. These are essential steps towards increasing the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the URBAN II initiative.	de
At national level, we are exceptionally keen that taxes on business and labour should be reduced towards the levels which prevail in our competitors' countries, but an issue such as that should be decided by the Swedish Parliament and not by the European Parliament. Through a situation in which different countries seek different solutions concerning tax and welfare policy, the opportunity is provided to adapt policy to the characteristic features of the individual nations and to test out different forms of social security systems. Tax harmonisation at European level should only take place in exceptional cases, for example in the cases of certain environmental taxes and taxes on capital. Even if we agree that a certain degree of tax harmonisation is necessary if the internal market is to function properly, Amendment No 4 is altogether too far-reaching and undifferentiated when it comes to this issue. Joint resolution on the shipwreck of the (RC B5-0181/2000) Mr President, we voted in favour of the resolution on the wreck of the Erika out of solidarity with the victims of this ecological disaster. We do, however, deplore the indecisive nature of the resolution. Confining oneself to deploring the disaster and expressing sympathy for its victims without applying some restraining measures in order to oblige Total to make good all the direct and indirect consequences of the pollution for which it is entirely responsible is tantamount to doing nothing. It is disgusting to see Total leaving the reparation of the damage it caused to volunteers and local authorities. It is equally disgusting to see the State releasing funds, inadequate funds moreover, which represent nothing more than a backdoor subsidy to this firm and its criminal dealings. Confining oneself to discussing merely the issue of flags of convenience is dodging the main issue. Whatever the flag of convenience used by Total, the oil company responsible is widely known and represented in all the countries of the European Union and the authorities concerned could, if they were so inclined, seize all of its assets until the company makes payment. We feel we must condemn, above all, this economy in which, in order to make extra profits, a firm can ruin a region with pollution in the same way that it can ruin a region by closing factories. Mr President, partly on behalf of the Breton partner of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, the Union Democratique Brétonne (UDB), I am asking for an effective policy to prevent further disasters of the kind involving the Erika. Legislation and controls should not only be tightened up but also applied to the letter. It was made painfully clear that a number of players need to be removed from the pitch in order to ensure that the Erika was the last unseaworthy ship to pollute the Breton coast. This is the seventh time that Brittany is having to deal with an oil slick since the Torrey Canyon shipwreck. No other region in the world has had to pay such a high price for the transport of polluting or dangerous substances by sea.	fr
Mr President, Commissioner, let me begin by warmly congratulating and thanking the rapporteur and pointing out that, in her report, she does not just welcome the draft framework decision but also proposes a few changes, which have been referred to by various speakers but which we cannot discuss in detail now, to supplement and improve the text. It is crucially important to continue the success story of the euro and we must make every effort not to spoil this success story or put it at risk by taking inadequate measures to prevent counterfeiting - and we are well aware of the initial attempts that are being made. We have all noted that the conversion phase will bring uncertainty and risks with it. So, in addition to the efforts to combat counterfeiting, to ensure the sound implementation of the provisions, the planned information campaign will of course play a key role and here we still have serious work to do. We are also concerned with the question of cooperation. We need to define the precise responsibilities of the ECB, the national central banks, the Commission and Europol pertaining to all matters relating to counterfeiting of the euro. I also think we should perhaps consider setting up an interinstitutional or EU body in charge of coordinating the cooperation work. In the same context, we could establish an early warning system functioning round the clock, together with a common information system for the rapid exchange of data between the responsible authorities. Aside from the report, which we welcome, many questions have arisen that still need to be resolved. I hope the debate we are holding here will bring some clarification. Mr President, Mrs Cederschiöld, ladies and gentlemen, how safe is the euro? That is, after all, a question the people often ask. And that question will of course become increasingly pressing with the approach of 1 January 2002, the date when they will have euros in their pockets. For the safety of the euro is not just a matter of the stability and external value of the currency but, in fact, also of protecting the euro against counterfeiting. That too is a concern of the people, for, as has rightly been said, this will be a new currency for them, new in terms of how it looks and also how it is used. Of course all the citizens of the EU Member States will also be faced with the novelty of a currency that is valid over such a wider area, and even beyond Europe, as a reserve currency. They will need time to get used to that too. So it is clearly necessary to ask what the EU is doing to protect the euro against counterfeiting. And that is what we are discussing at this late hour. This really is a subject that is close to the citizen, so it is a pity it is being debated at such a late hour. But that cannot be helped. Of course, the European Central Bank has been looking into the matter for a very long time.	fr
Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain. Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay. The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen. In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999. These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95. Question No 6 by (H-0788/99): Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities. In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244. The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc. In the light of the above, will the Council reconsider the funding for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as requested by Parliament? What other practical measures will it take to put a stop to ethnic cleansing? Mr Alavanos, I would like to say that I have the greatest sympathy for the concern underlying the issue you have raised. We genuinely share your concerns about the threatening situation which exists in Kosovo for ethnic minorities, for both the Serb and Romany populations, and the incidents of discrimination, harassment and intimidation which continue to take place in that region. The Council has always stressed the need to seek prosecution of all those who have perpetrated such acts and of those who continue to perpetrate such acts. The Council once again reiterated the need, in its December conclusions, to fully implement Security Council resolution 12/99 and has consistently supported Bernard Kouchner' s efforts to implement measures to guarantee effective protection of minorities in the region and, in particular, to guarantee that measures facilitating the preservation of the region' s multi-ethnic make-up are effectively implemented. In our contacts with senior political figures amongst the Kosovo Albanians, we have stressed - and the Portuguese Prime Minister did this very recently - that persecution of the Serb population, the Romany population and other ethnic groups is totally unacceptable.	es
The Union ought to reassess how aid for environmental projects can be allocated in a better way in support of a sustainable policy on water. With regard to the proposal for the directive it is worrying that the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy do not take sufficient account of the importance of unpolluted surface waters to increase the occurrence of clean, natural groundwater. In Finland surface waters are very clean. The production of so-called artificial groundwater is an ecological means of filtering a clean supply of fresh surface water through to the groundwater reserves. The process does not require a chemical sewage plant. The directive must not be allowed to endanger this work. Deviating from the Council' s common position, the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy is also attempting to restrict further the facilities for the transfer of water. This would cause problems for those countries where reserves of water are unevenly distributed. The ecologically sustainable transfer of water must not be restricted by Union acts. The work should, of course, be regulated and subject to license in the future too, but the same rules cannot apply to, for example, Finland and Greece, which suffers from drought. Mr President, Commissioner, water is a precious natural asset, a vital necessity, and it is our duty to protect it. I think it essential to have a framework directive on water policy in the European Union, which will be the basic legal instrument for improving the quality and proper management of water resources, and I congratulate the rapporteur on her attempt to address this thorny issue and take due account of all the points of view. I must say, however, that, there are discrepancies between the countries in the north and south concerning water, and that is why the matter cannot be dealt with in the same way. There are parts of Europe with an inherent shortage of water, and that should be taken into account by this directive. In recent years, climate change has compelled Mediterranean countries to face serious problems of flooding or lack of rain. We agree with the common position but we also accept several of the amendments tabled, whose aim is to improve it. However, we cannot accept amendments such as those that refer to the issue of costing water, granted that in my country a high proportion of the users are farmers. In addition, amendments which ban the transfer of water from one hydrological basin to another would condemn many areas in my country to water shortage. The issue of eliminating hazardous substances ought, I think, to be made more realistic so that we can achieve it. As for the time scale demanded for the directive' s implementation, it must be borne in mind that there are countries where creating the infrastructure for this directive' s implementation will take time and considerable resources. In spite of these remarks however, I believe our common objective of sustainable use of water resources can be maintained.	es
European postal services The next item is the debate on the oral question (B5-0010/2000) tabled by Mr Hatzidakis, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, to the Commission, on European postal services. Mr President, the postal sector continues to be an area in which old, outdated monopolies are allowed to operate regardless of the requirements of competition. And, in the absence of any energetic action by the Commission, the situation has gone on for far too long. The EU' s competition authority has intervened in all other areas, but not in the postal sector. We have now been waiting in vain for 18 months for the Commission to put forward proposals, so I should be grateful if the Commissioner could let me know today when we are likely to have a new, modern Europe-wide postal system. One of the EU' s most important tenets is the need for a common internal market. We are currently working hard to enlarge this to include ever more Member States. That requires greater efficiency which, in turn, is dependent on competition. Today, one area after another is being compelled to introduce deregulation and liberalisation, an exercise in which the EU often leads the way, while the Commission's determination to make progress serves as a model. The Commission is committed to liberalisation because experience has shown that the old monopolies are unable to provide the efficient service which a modern society expects. It is also because liberalisation is necessary in order to be able to keep up with technological advances and, moreover, because it will lead to lower prices. All that, we are assured, will be more easily attained in a free and competitive market. It has been done in a number of different areas but, unfortunately, the postal sector has remained the one major exception until now. It can hardly be because customers are satisfied. We are all familiar with the much-criticised price hikes, and delayed deliveries are a constant topic of discussion. If we really want a functioning internal market, we cannot go on constantly making an exception of the postal services. A number of countries have been in the forefront of introducing more competitive postal services. The Netherlands, Finland and Sweden have travelled furthest along this road. During the 1990s, they were able to show the benefits that could be achieved. Moreover, Sweden has introduced the changes gradually in a climate of political consensus. The process should be allowed to continue and be given the necessary encouragement. Experience has shown that the old monopolies cannot provide the type of efficient service which, as customers, we are all entitled to expect. Prior to this discussion, a letter was sent out by supporters of the old monopolies. They hold up Sweden as a warning, which might be appropriate in certain instances, but not as regards postal services. It is alleged in a circular that the price of postage has gone up by 59 per cent since liberalisation in 1993. That is true as long as account is taken of the 20 per cent of the total postal services market where, in practice, there is still a monopoly, that is where the state is the only player.	es
There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs. Many speakers have underlined this. The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs. We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs. Why? Is this simply a political gesture? No. In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints. Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share. We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1). We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular. The fourth group is legal certainty. Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe. Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition. I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty. (FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers. Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof. The White Paper requires only a single aspect of the issue to be re-examined: the exchange of confidential information. The guarantees which companies must be given are currently under discussion. (IT) I shall now quickly turn, Mr President, to Mr Rapkay' s report, and I would like to thank him sincerely for the quality of his work and for the broad endorsement given to the Commission' s XXVIIIth Annual Report on Competition Policy.	it
Secondly, we need to retain the details as they are included in the common position. As from 2006, therefore, all vehicles should be handed in at no cost to their last owners. Needless to say, this is most definitely an essential point which should not be changed in any way. Is this too much of a burden? There is, however, one thing we should not overlook. The directive applies to complete cars, that is to say cars with none of the essential components missing. According to the experts, few of these complete cars are of no value. After all, recycling and the re-use of components form part of a sector which is not necessarily loss-making. Quite the reverse, in fact. At present, there is a whole raft of companies which make a living out of them, and a decent one at that. This directive encourages the whole of this sector. It is a sector which comprises small and medium-sized businesses. Since, in this case, transport costs are high, a system will have to be introduced which will need to be very much decentralised, because transporting an end-of-life vehicle over a distance of more than 100 km is not a profitable activity. I think it is a good thing that this directive does not need to apply to historic vehicles, and I think we ought to add this provision to it. I think, therefore, that vintage cars ought to be exempt. Also, it is a good thing that we should clearly lay the burden of responsibility with the manufacturer. That is a basic principle which we must uphold. As manufacturers are responsible for the design, they can give a great deal of consideration to the environment at the conception phase. We must also insist that the cost is borne wholly or largely by the manufacturer, as stipulated in the common position. I find this a well-balanced formula which does not preclude a number of other things. I think we need to retain it. This is why our group will remain as close to the common position as possible and will not alter its essence. After all, we are all aware how difficult it was within the Council to bring this common position about, and that it was a very difficult balancing act to reach this common position. In my opinion, we should not jeopardise that common position, because it is a directive which we desperately need for environmental reasons. I would ask you to support this common position. Our group will, at any rate, do this as far as possible - for environmental reasons and because we have this directive which is well-balanced and encompasses a whole range of issues and difficulties including, for example, the way in which the costs are to be distributed. Mr President, we need to take an important decision today. Does this European Parliament support the ecological principle of manufacturer' s liability, that is to say that cars, once they have reached the end of their lives, are the responsibility of the car manufacturer? No, according to the Christian Democrats in Amendment No. 38: car manufacturers and car drivers should split the cost 50/50. It is evident from the packaging directive in which this 50/50 compromise is included that this does not work.	es
And therein lies the paradox. Political and monetary convergence in Europe unavoidably entails convergence of the respective rules of the game in the labour market and welfare systems. But, at the same time, the single currency and the absence of labour mobility, as well as of a redistributive fiscal policy, force us into a situation of non-convergence in terms of salaries and welfare, in order to compensate for the differences in marginal productivity at national and regional levels. Hypocrisy and fine-sounding words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernisation and concerted action are not going to extricate us from those contradictions. Either the European Union becomes a genuine federal state with a genuine redistribution of resources, genuine free movement of workers and therefore - but only at that point - common labour and welfare regimes, or it would be better not to deceive and be deceived by hopeless paths to convergence which sound impressive but which, in reality, only cause harm, above all to the most vulnerable. That is something we would do well to recognise. Mr President, unlike several of those who have spoken in today' s debate, I am inclined to endorse the Andersson report, one of the reasons for this being that I can see clear differences between the report and the Commission' s communications. In particular, I am referring to the fact that this report - and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on this - defends the European social model' s approach, which is one based on solidarity. I would like to highlight the clear positions adopted against social dumping, together with the right to a basic level of social security, the goal of social convergence, and, in particular, the quite specific points that have been made about equal opportunities for women being the primary objectives of this social policy. I can certainly see that it has its shortcomings in failing to undertake a sufficiently rigorous analysis of macroeconomic policy within the European Union, and it is this policy which stands in the way of the aforementioned solidarity-based revival of the European social state, model. All in all, though, I deem this report to be worthwhile. Mr President, I have taken the floor in order to reaffirm the need for the modernisation of social protection, which is much more then simply one more step in the construction of Europe. This message is contained in the excellent report by Mr Andersson. Europe, the European Union, although it is very strong in economic and political terms, will remain shaky, weak and limited, perhaps inadequate, if we are not able to strengthen it from a social point of view. I believe that the latter means the possibility of employment for those who require it, but also decisive action in support of the socially disadvantaged. Bearing in mind that everybody has the right to social protection and a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that we must not forget about those people who were not born in the European Union. Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate. In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain.	fr
Finally, Commissioner, we cannot forget that large sections of the economy are still firmly in the hands of the state, ranging from state television, which is funded on a mandatory basis by the taxpayer, and the Post Office, to some compulsory insurance schemes, including health and social welfare systems, which are managed by inefficient state monopolies which leave no-one but the wealthy user with any other option. Commissioner, I am quite familiar with the constraints imposed by the Treaties, but I believe that, it must be emphasised once again that the European economy is finding it hard to compete with the American economy, especially because of insufficiently open markets and a lack of genuine competition. What is being done may well be very important, but it is still not sufficient. Mr President, a White Paper, by definition, is not something you can take or leave. It is there to generate reactions and the White Paper has certainly succeeded in doing that. It forms a sound basis for discussion and is to be welcomed in this sense. I understand where the authors are coming from and I share their views. I also assume that you, Commissioner, want to honour the reputation of, and the work put in by, your predecessors and that your offices will pursue the same objective. I cannot imagine the Commission taking initiatives in order to de-Europeanise or re-nationalise in a thorough manner, but I have my concerns and questions nevertheless. Firstly, these relate to the coherence of the policy' s application. In general, I am a great defender of cultural diversity but not in terms of competitiveness within the internal market. The internal market needs a uniform competition policy, not only in terms of concept, but also in terms of application. It is true, there are some European regulations and interpretative statements on the way. The Commission is also said to have the right of evocation and can give guidelines to the national competition authorities. But I still wonder if we do not run the risk of ending up in a kind of Echternach procession where we will have to take one step back before we are able to take two steps forward. So, I would like to hear more about how the Commission will guarantee this uniform application in practice and whether you yourself consider the courses outlined from point one hundred onwards in the White Paper to be feasible. Secondly, I understand the worry of industry regarding legal certainty. Many dossiers are currently being filed with precisely this concern. This instrument will fall by the wayside in future. In the White Paper, you state that the Commission will still issue particular orders which can be used as guidelines, but what will your criteria be for granting such orders one day but not the next? Thirdly, I would like to know whether the Commission has looked into the effects its new approach will have on industrial strategy. I have particular concerns regarding the fate of SMEs which will lose part of their legal and financial protection, as is already the case, one has got to admit, within the new vertical group exemption for the distribution sector.	fr
In spite of all its virtues though, LIFE III' s regulation fails in what is obviously the most important aspect of determining a financial instrument' s impact, which is its budget. By persisting with their proposal of EUR 613 million as a reference amount for 2000 - 2004, and by refusing to accept the European Parliament' s proposal of EUR 850 million, the Commission and the Council are taking a decision which we do not feel is based on the same criteria of rationality and justice that they introduced, and rightly so, for other measures in LIFE III. We want the Commission and the Council to know that we will not give up trying to provide LIFE with the budget it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that we are seeking to achieve with this kind of instrument. We have four very straightforward arguments which we feel justify our choice. Firstly, LIFE is the only direct financial instrument which is designed to promote environmental policy within the European Union. There is no other such policy. Secondly, LIFE is an instrument that has already produced good results, and has enabled innovative methods and techniques to be developed and has an excellent rate of implementation. Thirdly, the LIFE budget has been reduced in real terms has not kept up with the enormous dynamism and creativity of demand. Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget. This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend. Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however. Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House. We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted. Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse. Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on the report she has carried out, and also the Commission - why not? - because this report, this position, generally improves on the texts in force. Furthermore, it contains more acceptable systematics and is clearer and more transparent. I would also like to congratulate the services of the Commission, since the evaluation, control and monitoring of the LIFE programme provide a reasonable guarantee with regard to the selection and execution of projects.	es
"Mr Sjöstedt, the answer that I gave was the only answer possible. Nevertheless, I would like to say that any interpretation of Article 255 of the Treaty must also be linked to the principle of subsidiarity. At the moment, there are no concrete proposals which would allow us to make adjustments under this Article, and unless there is such a proposal, we cannot move forward on this matter. In any event, Article 255 does not, at first sight, allow work to be done on any basis that could affect the principle of subsidiarity. I am, up to a point, concerned about how the Council will fight for the principles contained in the Treaty of Amsterdam and whose purpose is to ensure that citizens have a better opportunity to participate in the decision-making process. How is this to be done when, at the same time, the Commission' s proposal - which has been leaked, so the general public is aware of it - says that employees' freedom of thought comes before transparency and that it is not possible to have access to working documents, reports, drafts etc? Does not the Council' s representative think that this makes it difficult to participate in the democratic decision-making process? Mrs Frahm, the question that you raised is extremely important and we discussed it at great length during the last Intergovernmental Conference. I would like to say that transparency does not only apply from the Community institutions ""outwards"" , it also applies between the institutions. By this I mean that there are aspects of the form and procedure of the Community institutions' workings which are not accessible to the other institutions, and not only as regards the Commission' s relationship with Parliament, but also as regards the Commission' s relationship with the Council. As a matter of fact, at the last conference, this issue was raised and discussed on several occasions. The European Parliament will have the opportunity to take part in the preparatory group for the next Intergovernmental Conference. The matter is still open. Genuine transparency of the institutions' workings and the way they are presented throughout Europe is an extremely important issue and one which, in my opinion, needs to be studied again, particularly in the context of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference. We have no doubts about this and we think that the Members taking part in this preparatory group will have an opportunity to raise this issue again. I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter. For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area. It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked. We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities. We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam. One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context. The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States."	it
Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others. I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise. As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend. Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually. Regrettably, although ISA was first detected in Scotland only two years ago, it has now spread to 29 farms directly and around 240 other farms are affected in some way or another. Wild salmon, trout and eels have been found to carry the virus which now seems to be endemic even in the wider marine environment. But I must say that despite the scare-mongering of the Greens, it has to be emphasised that ISA cannot under any circumstances be transmitted to humans, and I must repeat what Mr Hudghton said, that the virus cannot survive above 25o - which is human body temperature - it is a virus of a cold-water species. It can, nevertheless, in the affected fish, lead to severe weight loss and early death in its advanced stages and it therefore has had a serious economic impact on the whole Scottish aquaculture sector costing the industry around EUR 60 to 70 million in losses arising from the mandatory premature culling and other eradication measures. So this report, Mr President, provides an encouraging range of proposals for improving the way in which the authorities in the UK and elsewhere should respond to the disease. By recommending the introduction of a method of containment and gradual culling, similar to the system used successfully in Norway, the rapporteur seeks to introduce a more flexible approach to the disease which will provide confidence, not least to the insurance sector who have hitherto shied clear of providing any form of cover due to the insistence on a policy of compulsory slaughter. By recommending the research, development and ultimate use of vaccination to control and eradicate ISA, the rapporteur also provides comfort to the pharmaceutical industry who have hitherto had no incentive to invest in the development of a vaccine. So I thoroughly recommend and hope that the Parliament will support this excellent report. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Hudghton, also for this report. Scottish salmon farming is the biggest in the European Union and accommodates 90% of the British aquacultural industry. The industry is located in some of Europe' s most peripheral communities providing an economic lifeline to those communities.	es
Firstly, proper port reception facilities for ship-generated waste have to be constructed at every European port unless it already has them. They must therefore be provided. Secondly, all ships, regardless of the flag they fly, have to dispose of their waste. Thirdly, the costs must be borne by the ship. We agree on these points. In fact, together we want to put a system in place so as to avoid there being financial incentives to dump waste into the sea. Firstly, we wish to protect flora and fauna and secondly, there are a large number of coastlines along which, on the one hand, tourists enjoy themselves and on the other jobs are to be created. That means that we want to have an effective system. So where do we differ from the Council, apart from on minor details such as the fact that we wish to exempt museum ships from the bureaucratic rules and that we are a little stricter where large fishing vessels and recreational craft are concerned? The really decisive difference is the issue of how the disposal costs are charged to the ship. Mr Bouwman has, of course, already explained this. There are two precedents. The first is in the Baltic Sea area, and this is not the experience of an individual state but the experience of the entire Baltic Sea area, and it says that if a large proportion of the disposal costs is covered by the general port dues then there is obviously no incentive to dispose of the ship-generated waste at sea. Surely if people have already paid the disposal costs then they will actually dispose of the waste in port. The other system is the pure polluter-pays principle: anyone who lands ship-generated waste has to pay extra for doing so. This second system has proved to be ineffective, otherwise why would the Mediterranean Sea be so dirty? Why would the North Sea be so dirty? Because for lack of adequate controls the polluter-pays principle does not work! That is why a broad majority of the committee - not a large majority; the representatives of the minority view will be speaking shortly - said, as Parliament as a whole did in the first reading, without any dispute, that the 'no-special-fee' system was the best system because it, as it were, offers ships a financial incentive not to dump their muck into the water when they are at sea but to dispose of it in proper port reception facilities. That is the decisive issue. We are prepared to reach an agreement with the Council. But so far the Council has rejected any serious agreement with us. That is why I call on the House to support our amendment whereby a significant proportion - up to 90% - of the costs have to be covered by the general port dues. This would give us the opportunity to reach an agreement with the Council in the conciliation procedure, whether it be on 75% or whatever. That is also why I would make the following request of the Commission: Madam Vice-President, think carefully about which side you stand on! I believe that in the interests of protecting the environment and of a permanently thriving tourist industry in many countries of our Community it is better to have an effective system. For these reasons support our 'no-special-fee' system. Perhaps then we will reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation procedure. Mr President, I am pleased that you are the one chairing this debate because I know that as a Bavarian you always offer a sympathetic ear where ports and maritime matters are concerned, and I should like to thank the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, for the work which he has done and also for cooperating with us in the run-up to tomorrow's vote.	de
How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority? If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way? These are my three questions. . Yes, Mr President, that is true. There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management. They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case. However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle. It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete. That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science. It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base. We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future. You have to see this as a tool for risk management. You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available. You have to assess all that and evaluate the science. Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not. So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today. Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle. It is about brominated flame retardants. It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment. There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are. Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants. I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative.	fr
"This certainly holds true for globalisation, which permits greater growth in wealth, international trade and productivity. However, unregulated globalisation, which is what we have today, or globalisation in which large sections of the world' s population do not benefit from significant investment in people, is also a factor in exclusion, in division and in widening the gap between rich and poor. This also applies to the knowledge society, which may give rise to a new equality of opportunity, but could also be a factor in the increasing gulf between those who have access to it and those who do not. This also applies to the relationship between the old and new economies. This is in fact not the first time that a technological transition has changed the social model and the model of economic organisation. At such times of profound change, problems, particularly those concerning employment in the old economy, have been resolved by turning to the new economy and its resources. To give an example, in Europe we have a textile industry. We must maintain a textile industry in Europe, but this will only happen if we are able to apply the technologies of the information and knowledge society. It is quite extraordinary that at the moment, in the so-called ""new economy"" sectors, there is a shortfall of around 800 000 qualified people for existing posts at the same time that there are millions of people unemployed. This means that we have not yet managed to use the resources of the new economy to resolve the problems of the old economy. We will never find solutions to those problems if we approach them with the mindset of that old economy. Lastly, I would like to answer a question that I have been asked, which is whether I am speaking here on behalf of 15 or 14 countries. The answer is simple: I am speaking on behalf of 15 countries. One of the things that the Portuguese Presidency has guaranteed is Austria' s full participation in the workings of all of the Union' s institutions. This does not prevent the Portuguese Government, and many other European governments, from being not so much in dispute with a particular country, as being engaged in a battle to preserve certain principles and values. Strangely enough, these very principles and values existed even before political movements such as the Social Democrats and the Christian Democrats. I am talking about principles and values which come from the Enlightenment and which affirm the supremacy of reason. Because, if modern societies have one enemy today, it is irrationality in political behaviour. We could call this irrationality political populism, or excessive nationalism, or religious fundamentalism, or racism or xenophobia. This is a key issue: unless these values are respected, we may have a healthy economy, we may have jobs, but there will be no Europe. , Commission. (IT) Mr President, Prime Minister, just a few quick comments to close this debate, which has been lengthy but extremely important and constructive. Firstly, we are not starting from scratch. Anybody who may think that we have been too optimistic in this debate must understand that we are not starting from scratch. Europe has the advantages of the single currency and the single market to build on."	de
And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require. It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded. My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road. Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme. We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector. It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it. I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process. I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni. They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution. Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time. We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner. I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment. It stated that on the occasion of the report it must draw up in accordance with Article 7 of the European Parliament and Council decision, it would carry out an assessment of the results of the programme, and this assessment will also cover the financial resources in the context of the Community financial perspectives. If need be, the report shall contain a proposal to amend the decision, and this should be achieved by 30 June 2002. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a formal commitment, not just words on paper. All this must lead us to intensify our action in favour of developing a common cultural area, within which our cultures can flourish further in all their unique features, in all their diversity, but may also be mutually enriched and the other citizens of Europe may participate fully in them. It is thanks, too, to Parliament' s action, preferring a number of small-scale measures to be carried out close to the citizens' cultural roots rather than vast measures on a spectacular scale. This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen.	de
We are of course entering a grey area here, and you may say, Mr Marset Campos, that these are civilian targets, such as bridges and road and rail infrastructure, whilst others will tell me that they are military targets, because they are targets which support military structures in aggressive campaigns such as those carried out by Mr Milosevic' s forces in Kosovo. So we do not see eye to eye on how we view certain targets. Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks. This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible. And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community. Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light. Question No 4 by (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer. Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship. We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all. We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours. Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front? - (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem.	es
Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time. I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy. I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces. Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now. I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party. The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans. Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary. This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe. We are talking about us, not Austria. We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe. Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat. The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation. Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past. Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent. This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action. Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament. In the manifesto of the Austrian Democratic Freedom Party, there is nothing to justify the accusations that it is attacking the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms or the rule of law, enshrined in Article 6 of the Treaties. I would, however, like to draw your attention to the fact that the President-in-Office, who has been so critical of Austria, has recently consigned the inhabitants of Macao to the sovereign rule of the People' s Democratic Republic of China.	fr
"What else will the Union undertake in this respect if the demand from the opposition - bringing forward elections - is met? What else can we do to support this opposition? Mr President, Commissioner, Kosovo was hopefully the last occasion on which international law could be interpreted as saying that dictators could persecute minorities in the most repellent way on the grounds that ""it is happening within their own nation"" . When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late. A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively. We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now. Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade. Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration. We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported. It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report. Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war. Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms. We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans. This is an urgent duty for the EU. Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia. The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free. I am talking about Milosevic. As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia. Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe, Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order. All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union. The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe."	es
Sanctions can be imposed after the Treaties have been violated, but cannot be applied if a democratically elected party enters government. Otherwise, how will we deal with Communist countries which return to Communism: will we throw them out of the Union too if Communists enter into government, or will Stalin' s grandchildren be forgiven for everything? (Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles. Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this. This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions. So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region. However, we already knew this. However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role. We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights. We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union. This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks. We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics. And these are the consequences! Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples. Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy. Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach. In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria. There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach. If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them. And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court. We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway.	it
The new agreement will entail a firm commitment on both sides to good governance as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject for regular dialogue in an area which enjoys active Community support. Secondly, a new procedure has been drawn up for cases of violations of human rights, democratic principles and the rule of law. In comparison with the current procedure, the new one puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and allows for greater flexibility in the consultation process, with a view to conducting an effective dialogue leading to measures to be taken to redress the situation. In cases of special urgency involving serious violations of one of these essential elements, measures will be taken immediately and the other party will be notified. Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption. This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general. This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development. It is thus not confined to EC activities. This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances. By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors. Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration. We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area. This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999. The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions. The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration. We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration. The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party. This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons. These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance. The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid. We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters. We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned. Negotiations will start no later than 2002. This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations.	de
"Stenzel report (A5-0034/2000) Mr President, I would very briefly like to give an explanation of vote, on behalf of the PPE Group on the EQUAL report. We have followed a nominal list which was identical to that which we had agreed upon beforehand with the Socialist Group. The Socialist Group has now changed its mind and this is why the report is not as clear as it would have been. This is why we are abstaining. We want to ensure that the EQUAL report, which is very important for refugees, the elderly, the handicapped and women, simply goes ahead. It is regrettable that, due to the procedure, the report has received such unfavourable attention in this plenary session. I am convinced that the rapporteur' s nationality has played a certain role, which should not be of relevance in this Parliament. This is actually in conflict with European values and certainly with the parliamentary values which are referred to so often in this Parliament. These were our reasons for abstaining from the vote on this report. We want EQUAL to go ahead. We assent to the main thrust of it, but we deplore the procedure and especially the fact that some groups have exploited this procedure to their advantage. Mr President, as the representative of the Pensioners' Party in the European Parliament, I abstained in the vote on the EQUAL initiative because, although it provides more support than in the past for projects aimed at combating age discrimination, its proposals are not sufficiently trenchant or specific. I also abstained for another reason. I think the time has come for the European institutions to stop experimenting and trying to establish best practices for doing what we should do and begin to give European citizens some firm indication regarding what Europe wants Europe to be. The time has come for concrete measures and for putting theory into practice. . (DA) We have voted in favour of the report on the communication from the Commission concerning the guidelines for EU initiative programmes (CIP). Basically, we are opposed to programmes and structural funds of this type but, since the vote is only concerned with how - and not to what extent - these resources are to be used, we have simply adopted a position on the issue. We think it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups discussed in the report. . (FR) We did not vote against this report insofar as it contains a number of correct general principles such as the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce inequalities between the sexes on the job market. Nor did we vote for it because it is all too vague, all too pie in the sky. And yet, in the chapter on aid and training for refugees, the report marks a step backwards from the initial text by stipulating that they no longer apply to refugees as such but to ""refugees within the meaning of the Geneva Convention"" . This restriction is inadmissible at a time when countless refugees throughout Europe are in a drastic situation, with no protection, forced to work on the black market, and to hide, while so-called democratic governments and state police forces hunt them down."	it
It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish. As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts. The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes. The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects. There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority. More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective. Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion. This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available. ) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time. The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner. This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States. The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received. In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data. I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs.	fr
"As far as the timetable and objectives are concerned, the Council' s objective is to achieve good quality surface water within 16 years of the entry into force of the directive, while the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this reduced to 10 years. The committee is also calling for an end to discharges or leaks of dangerous substances by 2020, the final objective being to achieve zero input by 2020. The Council hopes to achieve good quality groundwater within 16 years, but the Commission wants no further deterioration in the chemical status of groundwater so that good quality groundwater can be achieved in 10 years. All the standards and all the objectives relating to protected zones should be achieved within 10 years, not 16. I must say that I support these reduced deadlines, especially as provision is made for derogations. As far as costs are concerned, I approve the proposal whereby Member States will have to ensure by 2010 that water pricing policies provide incentives for more sensible use of water resources. I likewise expect the European Commission to make a clear declaration undertaking to submit a proposal to ensure that water pricing policies reflect the environmental costs and the costs in terms of resources by 2012. I will close by quoting one of the amendments tabled by the Committee on the Environment, which needs no further comment: ""Water is not a commercial product like any other but, rather, a heritage which belongs to the peoples of the European Union and which must be protected, defended and treated as such"" . . I wish to put on the official record my concerns with the Lienemann report and also the reasons for my vote. We have all agreed on the need to put in place proper controls for the protection of our water supplies and also for the users of water. There is much to be praised in the approach to the problem suggested by the rapporteur. However, the question of taxation or charges for the use of water is a matter which, under the rules of subsidiarity, should be left to the Member States for decision. In my belief it is incorrect to use such a crude tool as a common European charge for this issue. In Ireland all the major users of water, commercial, industrial and agricultural, already pay for their use of water. This is a decision of national and local government, and this is where all future decisions should be retained. These are the main reasons for my vote. . The European Union is currently in the process of adopting new EU water legislation to update and to establish a long-term strategy to ensure the supply of clean drinking water and the protection of existing water resources including rivers and coastal waters. I support the objectives of this community action in the field of water policy. However, I do not support the proposal that domestic water users be charged for water used."	es
It is true that Mozambique' s democracy is still far from perfect, as shown by the way in which the results of the recent presidential elections were contested and doubts were cast upon them. But given this situation, which is so tragic for the people of Mozambique, we must not fail to provide an effective and appropriate response to the appeals of Mozambique' s leaders, both those in the government and those in opposition, who, out of a sense of responsibility, have resisted from resorting to violence again as a means of solving their problems. Mr President, Commissioner, I would like to add my voice to all those who have already spoken in order to draw this House' s attention - which was not really necessary, but it had to be done - to the appalling tragedy unfolding in Mozambique. I have some figures here, which I believe are the most up-to-date ones available. More than three hundred people have already died, six hundred and fifty thousand have become displaced, two million four hundred thousand people have been cut off, with eighty-five thousand needing to be evacuated, some of whom are in treetops, others on roofs. As has already been said, helicopters are the priority and it is equally important that there is no delay in providing this humanitarian aid. Otherwise, apart from the tragedy created by the floods, the next tragedy will arise: that of a lack of aid to the people, who will die of hunger and disease and who will die in the floods. This would be a real tragedy and one which would weigh heavily on the conscience of us all. The Commissioner said a while ago that he had emotional ties with Mozambique, as I have myself, and that he therefore understands the whole tragic situation taking place and what is at stake. I hope that the mission by Commissioner Nielson and the Portuguese State Secretary will provide the information that this House needs in order to understand the current situation, and what the most urgent needs are, so that we can help the people of Mozambique, who genuinely deserve our help, in their struggle for development. . Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking. Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything. But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness. There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place.	es
As I have already said, the Commission is aware of its own responsibilities and it is accordingly putting the finishing touches to an initial proposal for a scoreboard so that the institutions and other interested parties can assess the progress made in implementing the required measures and in complying with the deadlines set down in the Treaty of Amsterdam, in the Vienna action plan and in the conclusions of the Tampere European Council. This scoreboard will not just be a mere instrument of legislative planning. It will also, and above all, be an instrument for increasing transparency and increasing the accountability of all the European Union' s institutions towards the public. It is for the public, therefore, that we are developing the area of freedom, security and justice. The progress made will not be due to the Commission nor to the Council, nor even to the European Parliament, but to a combination of European institutions and to the Member States themselves, in as much as - as has already been pointed out here - specific tasks on the scoreboard will be entrusted to the Member States under the principle of subsidiarity. In the coming weeks, I shall be making a tour of capitals to sound out the opinions of the various ministers for justice and home affairs. I hope to have a debate with the European Parliament and with civil society on this scoreboard project. And we hope, during the Portuguese Presidency, to present the final version to the Justice and Home Affairs Council, taking account of the soundings that I have just mentioned. It is my intention that this scoreboard should become an instrument providing political and strategic guidance to all the institutions, and that it should also be an instrument for public scrutiny. For this reason, and I believe that this is a challenge we are all facing, I recognise the need to develop a communication strategy which will allow us to make the real added value which the Union brings to daily life accessible and visible to the public at large - in areas which are essential for citizenship, for legality and, ultimately, for democracy itself. In addition to the scoreboard, I would like to anticipate the following initiatives that the Commission intends to present during 2000 - and I would like to emphasise that I am delighted the Portuguese Presidency is treating progress in the area of freedom, security and justice as a priority in its work programme. I hope that in conjunction with the Portuguese Presidency it will be possible to achieve a clear spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, which is also the political message of Tampere, and that this spirit of interinstitutional cooperation will be carried forward by subsequent presidencies. Regarding immigration and asylum, the Commission intends to present proposals for creating a Community instrument on the temporary protection of refugees; to initiate an analysis of criteria and conditions for improving implementation of the Dublin Convention and consideration of a possible change in its legal basis, in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam; to continue the debate on the basis of the communication already published concerning standards for a common asylum process throughout the Union; and to present proposals with a view to preparing legislation on the granting of residence permits to victims of trafficking in human beings who cooperate with judicial action against networks of traffickers.	fr
Mr President, we have listened to the statements by the Council and the Commission and I would like to make the following observations. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I appreciate the sensitivity with which you are addressing the issue and your effort to establish contact with the Turkish Cypriot side, but perhaps it would be more clear and more correct if the vocabulary you use did not leave one suspecting that you might be attempting some kind of indirect recognition, even though you stressed that this is not the case. For example, I would not refer to the government of Nicosia. It is the Cypriot Government, Mr President-in-Office, not the government of Nicosia. That government has proposed a way in which the Turkish Cypriot side can take part, and I think it would be right for the Council and the Commission to urge the Turkish Cypriot side to take part institutionally in the framework of the negotiations conducted by the Republic of Cyprus. On the other hand, the way that the issue of the end of the protocols and the pre-accession strategy has been addressed so far creates some doubts for us. I cannot understand why the two small countries must be treated differently, nor why a clash was necessary between the institutional bodies. Nor can I understand the pressure applied by Parliament to include the funds in Chapter 7 for the pre-accession strategy. How can the whole of the European Union treat, in this way, two small countries situated on its periphery? Not only are they countries which the European Union needs, but they are also countries which are fully qualified to operate within the Union and are already considered capable of participating in economic and monetary union. As the Commissioner said, and I agree with him, it is a matter of political decision. This is a small political decision which would bring major benefits, especially in helping the two communities effectively to constitute one state, to achieve effective rapprochement - because the two communities were once close - and for the Republic of Cyprus, genuinely, to be rid of occupying forces. Mr President, we are required under the advisory procedure to debate a proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations within the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta. This proposal is similar to the proposal submitted for other candidate countries and, once it is implemented, will replace the financial protocols which have now expired. Pre-accession instruments are designed to provide technical and financial support for efforts by candidate countries to meet the demands of the Community acquis. The Commission' s analysis has in fact shown that, although classified as high income countries by the World Bank, Cyprus and Malta have the same difficulties as the CEECs in transposing Community law due to their lack of administrative and judicial capacity. It was pointed out, during the discussion of Mr Brok' s excellent report in committee, that both countries can also benefit from the MEDA budget line for horizontal projects of regional interest. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could explicitly confirm that.	de
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work. I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes. This is a crucial goal. In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required. . (SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do. In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role. For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission. If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up. My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women. This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field. I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement. I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up. I hope that this will be of benefit. Question No 43 by (H-0045/00): Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence. What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation. How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area? Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area? The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member. The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan. The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive. That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive.	es
In particular, the Commission can accept in full Amendments Nos 6, 16, 21, 28, 31, 33, 34, 44, 45, 46, 48, 52, 53, 65, 67, 68, 75, 76, 78, 80, 84, 85, 88 and 102. The Commission can accept in part Amendments Nos 8, 18, 27, 29, 42, 43, 47, 54, 60, 62, 93, 94, 104 and 105. The Commission can accept in principle Amendments Nos 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 12, 14, 17, 20, 22, 24, 25, 26, 30, 32, 35, 36, 37, 38, 50, 55, 56, 57, 58, 63, 69, 73, 79, 86, 89, 96, 99, 106 and 108. But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. Thank you for your attention. (The President declared the common position approved as amended) Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution)President. That concludes the vote EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) . (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE. I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council. As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following: LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment; Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients; The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere; The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation. I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries.	fr
"We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries. The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund. In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the ""communitisation"" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice. We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment. In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering. In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust. In 1999, the Commission also presented its contribution towards a European action plan to combat drugs, which underpins the strategy approved by the Helsinki European Council. This list of actions, which is not exhaustive, should, here today, in the presence of the Council Presidency and of the Members of this House, help to make it clear that, while 1999 was a year of consolidation for EU action in this key area, it also - I very much hope - represented the start of a new phase, marked by the desire to speed up the establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice. For this reason, 2000 will no doubt be a year for testing how the EU' s institutions respond to our citizens' demands for guaranteed freedom of movement, with respect for their rights and guarantees of security and stability though appropriate judicial protection. In other words, 2000 will be a test of the political will to take Amsterdam seriously and to help to build the foundations for an enlarged political Union for the next decade - a test for the Council, for Parliament and for the Commission."	fr
Packaging still accounts for a mountain of rubbish in Europe and is a burden upon the environment. Some of the socialists under the direction of Mr Bernd Lange say: yes, we approve of this principle but we need not implement it until 2010 or 2012 according to Amendment No 45. The common position stipulates 2006. According to the group of the Greens, this gives the car industry ample time to make the necessary preparations. I would therefore urge my colleagues not to support Amendment No 38 of the Christian Democrats and Amendment No 45 of some of the socialists. If car manufacturers need to bear the cost of recycling their cars, they will design these cars in such a way that they can be re-used more easily and more cheaply. The problem of plastic and PVC will then no longer exist in cars and these products will be replaced by plant-based bioplastic. This is ultimately cheaper, also for the consumer. For twenty years, the majority within Parliament has attempted to make European environmental policy greener. Today, this green position is being threatened under pressure from, in particular, the German and French car industries. That is why I urge you to vote against Amendments Nos 38 and 45. We, the Green Group, by and large support the common position. Mr President, the waste from end-of-life vehicles is one of our really major environmental problems in terms both of the quantity of waste and of emissions of environmentally hazardous substances. We in the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left therefore want as comprehensive and consistent a set of regulations as is humanly possible in this area. With this directive, we have the chance to take a big step forward, but this presupposes that the Council' s position is not torn to shreds and weakened in Parliament' s reading of it. If they were adopted, many of the amendments which have been tabled would considerably weaken the directive. This applies, above all, to amendments from the Group of the European People' s Party but also, unfortunately, to some of the amendments from Mr Lange, as I see it. It is easy to see that the car industry in certain countries, for example in Germany, went in for some pretty tough lobbying before the present directive was adopted. For ourselves, it is crucial that the following principles should apply. The polluter should pay. This means that it is the manufacturer which should take full responsibility, financial as well as otherwise, for recycling vehicles. There must be rules governing existing vehicles too. Where this aspect is concerned, we cannot accept any weakening of the Council' s position regarding the date from which the regulations are to come into force. There should be no falling-off in the percentages concerned or in the requirements for recycling vehicles from particular years, and it is important to limit the use of dangerous substances such as lead. We shall vote against any amendments which run counter to these considerations. If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues.	es
A paper this short is a farce. A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand. A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard. It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard. We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme. What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand. We want instruments to prevent abuse. We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime. We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Commissioners, I rise to speak on the subject of the World Trade Organisation, on which there is a broad convergence of views between the Commission documents and the positions of the Socialist Group. This is not the case in other areas, as has already been pointed out. We share these views because we are in favour of world trade, but we want this trade to be conducted according to common standards, common rules which would regulate world trade with one aim in mind. This aim is that trade should benefit development, and particularly harmonious development in which the values of citizenship do not only apply to the world' s most dynamic and competitive regions. On the other hand, what does this statement tell us about principles? This regulation and these standards have brought an increased volume of trade for the World Trade Organisation, in other words, increased wealth, but when we look at how this wealth is distributed, we see, unfortunately, that the gulf between the world' s richest countries and blocks and the poorest and least developed countries continues to increase. It is therefore quite legitimate and even imperative that we ask ourselves, what purpose do the current common standards and rules serve? What good are the current way in which we negotiate and the way in which the World Trade Organisation works, if they cause trade to increase on the one hand, but on the other, they create problems and above all cause this gulf between rich and poor countries to grow? That is why we said that we were in favour of the strategy that the Commission outlined here for the Seattle negotiations and for later ones. We are certainly in favour of this strategic vision but we need to be brave and ambitious. We need to be demanding and ensure that social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection are incorporated into the forthcoming negotiations.	de
This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs. Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted. The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources. We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business. We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation. There is one point about the impact for firms which is of great importance. This was raised by Mrs Thyssen, Mrs Peijs and Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: the issue of SMEs. Many speakers have underlined this. The Commission is paying particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs. We are proposing a system which considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs. Why? Is this simply a political gesture? No. In the system we propose reforming our substantive rules in such a way that most SMEs will be covered by block exemption regulations, as in the field of vertical restraints. Most SMEs have in fact less than 30% of the market share. We have a de minimis notice which contains a declaration that since SMEs are not involved in market dominance they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition under Article 81(1). We are working on further block exemptions and guidelines which will all take into account the particular situation of SMEs, and our White Paper on modernisation will also improve the situation of SMEs, first by eliminating the bureaucracy resulting from the present notification system, and secondly, by making Article 81(3) directly applicable, which will benefit SMEs in particular. The fourth group is legal certainty. Mr Evans, legal certainty is, of course - and I am the first to acknowledge this - important for businesses, not just for the legal professions, although the latter do play an extremely important role in the construction of Europe. Legal certainty is important for businesses: this is a subject, the importance of which the Chair of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, emphasised in her last intervention - and I am very grateful to her for the way she always takes the widest interest in subjects regarding the single market, including, in this case, competition. I am convinced that this proposal will increase legal certainty for businesses for three reasons: by virtue of the direct effect of Article 81(3), it will permit authorisation, without a prior decision, of all restrictive competition agreements which meet the exemption conditions; it will create the opportunity to help businesses in the event of doubts over interpretation through the publication of reasoned opinions; it will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines which will clarify the rules and ensure certainty. (FR) Mrs Thyssen also referred to the matter of legal privilege for company lawyers. Let me simply remind you that the Court of Justice pronounced a ruling on this in 1982, as you know better than I. This ruling remains valid and there is nothing to justify any reconsideration thereof.	de
The free recovery system, for example, for old vehicles and raising the percentage to be recycled will increase recycling activities and the number of jobs this generates accordingly. Thus, for the consumer, for the environment and for the new jobs to be created in recycling, the Council' s common position definitely must not be amended. It is, as it stands, perfectly acceptable. Mr President, like so many others here today, I believe this is a good measure. This is a useful measure and it is one which we all need. Most of the technical issues have been resolved. There are some details to be finalised but most of the technical issues have been resolved. We have arrived at the final question. In the first reading debate it was only the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee which asked this question and it was only myself as the draftsman of the opinion of that committee who posed that question in Parliament. That is quite simply: Who pays? The Council common position reached a reasonable compromise in that the manufacturers should pay a significant part of the cost, not all of it as Mr Bowis has mistakenly said. In fact perhaps as little, the lawyers tell us, as 20% or one-fifth of the cost. That is not unreasonable. If you look at the UK consumer for example, who buys a Rover, as Mr Lange has indicated or for that matter any other make of car in the UK and who has for years been paying excessive prices for those cars, over and above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should they pay? They have paid already. Why should the very same people as taxpayers or as future car buyers, pay again to dispose of the vehicle that the manufacturer has made the profit from? I cannot accept that. There are amendments here today that are proposing that should be the case. I cannot accept it and I will not vote for it. The responsibility for these cars lies with the manufacturer. It is the manufacturer who has to provide the infrastructure and provide a reasonable part of the cost of disposal. The common position does not preclude the possibility of contributions being made by government. The common position is a reasonable compromise. Some of the amendments today are totally unreasonable in that they take away completely the responsibility from the car manufacturer of paying a little if any of the cost of disposal of cars on the road. I cannot accept that and on behalf of the taxpayers and the consumers of Europe I am voting against those amendments. Mr President, there is agreement that we must give some thought as to how we in Europe will properly deal with end-of-life cars, although in this instance the Council has not provided a model for a suitable European environment policy. It is disgraceful the way in which the German Presidency handled this matter. Firstly, Herr Trittin, the Environment Minister, was not in tune with his colleagues in the Cabinet, then Chancellor Schröder blundered in like a bull in a china shop, having no expert knowledge of this process.	fr
Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out. This is the crux of the matter. The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December. With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money. The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned. Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is. It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full. But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough. The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future. In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island. The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes. I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved. Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter. What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years?	es
And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court. We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway. We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter. We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States. We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice... (The President cut the speaker off) Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate. We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich. We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union. My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well. Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected? Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament. I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government. Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country. Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected. Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union. Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria. My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy. Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly.	es
On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion. That concludes the explanations of vote. (The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation) The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China. Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate. I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House. Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see. At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them. Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails. I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights. With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union. In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations. Mr President, in a world such as this, which is increasingly dominated by the phenomenon of globalisation, and not only in the economic field, our responses, in order to be effective, must be concerted and coordinated. In order to make our actions effective, we must implement a type of coordination in practice which does not exist at present. This Parliament therefore advocates the principle that we need to participate in the Commission on Human Rights and other international fora which deal with these issues and, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate in this type of meeting as soon as possible.	it
Madam President, great importance has been attached to the reform process, which deserves to be acknowledged, although this may be somewhat premature. My question is this: there is a need for reform, due not least to the accession of new countries, and thus to the enlargement of the Union. How can we - the Commission, Parliament and also the national parliaments of the applicant countries - meet this challenge more effectively, taking into account the ideas and considerations of the applicant countries? The delegations are actively engaged - as am I in my delegation for relations with the Czech Republic - but it is clear that there is often a pronounced schoolmasterish tone to our dealings with one another. How can the reform process help make the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and also the Commission, and the work they perform together, more effective? I am grateful to the honourable Member for underlining the fact that, apart from its own inherent merits, reform will be made necessary by accession, the enlargements, and particularly the kind of enlargements that our Union will shortly be engaging in. It is essential that we have that reform, both for the sake of the current Union, and certainly to facilitate accessions. In the course of the coming years I will be continuing the practice I have already started, together with several of my Commission colleagues obviously, of very profound discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States. We are doing it in order to try to explain in the fullest terms the system into which they will be entering. I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken both by current Member States and by the Union generally to ensure that as new officials come in to the Commission and officials and administrators in the Member States have to deal with the realities, the complex realities of membership of the Union and the single market, it will be difficult to see the joins. That is the level of sophistication and provision I would like to see. All I can do now is to promise to strive for it. Can I start by wishing the Commissioner a very happy St David' s Day. Thank you for the presentation. It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a complete waste of time unless it reconnects with the European public. That really has to be the sharp focus the whole time. It has to give a service to them and certainly the recommendations on cutting down on payment delays I am sure will be very welcome, but the other major complaint we get from the people we represent is paperwork. Excessive paperwork. Is there a reference to cutting down paperwork and bureaucracy for applicants to European funding whilst ensuring financial control? That is a clear complaint that we get. That needs to be addressed. The other question I would like to ask is on the audit progress committee. This, of course, is welcome, but it is essential it include a reference to the monitoring of recommendations that come from the European Parliament within our discharge procedure. Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words.	de
"The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings. Nevertheless, I do not think that this is the time to call into question the agreement obtained in the 1995 Convention which was, moreover, based on a timescale for negotiations of approximately thirty years. Consequently, the Commission has refrained from presenting an amendment. Instead, it has limited itself to focusing its opinions on institutional issues. The Commission feels, for this reason too, that it should not present a modified proposal for amendments to the regulation, but I would nevertheless like to convey to you the Commission' s opinions on the amendments under discussion. The Commission therefore accepts Amendments Nos 1, 2, 3 and 5 proposed by the rapporteur, Mr Lechner. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendment No 4. Indeed, the Commission feels that Parliament should instead support Amendment No 4 by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, which would allow the annexes to the regulation to be modified by the Commission, assisted by a regulatory committee, in accordance with the on-going procedure of Article 5 of Decision 1999/468/EC. Therefore, with regard to the amendments proposed by the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, the Commission accepts Amendments Nos 3 and 4. On the other hand, it does not accept Amendments Nos 1 and 2, on the idea of ""centre of the debtor' s main interests"" . With regard to the centre of main interests of a company or of a legal person, this idea is clearly defined in Article 3. In all other cases that have not been specifically addressed, we feel that the reference made in Recital 13 should be sufficient. Thank you very much, Commissioner Vitorino. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. (The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.) Shipwreck of the Erika The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today. Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments. He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this. On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika. There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue. Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident."	de
Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi. Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them. Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors. And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe. Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months. Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this. We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice. Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems. This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres. For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged. A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements. We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees. The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable. All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect. Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry. They were treated like the worst criminals. They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police. The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour. Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships. The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed. Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up. The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis. Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action. The laws against racism must be harmonised. What direction do you intend to give to Article 13 of the EC Treaty? What do you intend to do to promote equal treatment in wages for men and women? How do you aim to eradicate homophobia, racism and sexism?	fr
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency. As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated. We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us. I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda. I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate. Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines. We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label. I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does. It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth. As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now. They are the first but they are not the only subjects, Mr Seguro, that the conference must deal with. We have dealt with other subjects and we have mentioned our idea that other subjects may be dealt with in this conference, if the Portuguese Presidency firstly, and then the French Presidency, so wish, in view of the serious nature of the present juncture prior to enlargement. We are ready for it, whether it is a matter of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, on which work has started, the CFSP and the consequences for the institutions of the current defence policy negotiations, or an extremely difficult subject on which we are continuing to work: reorganisation of the Treaties. I have heard many comments on the Commission' s opinion, which mentioned all these subjects and dealt with many of them in depth, with specific indications of new draft articles, but no one has said that we were going beyond the Helsinki mandate.	de
Mr President, Commissioners, when this House is called upon to debate human rights it is taking a chance, if you will, that is reinforced by the conditions that prevail when we are called upon to discuss such a crucial issue. The absence of the Council, as well as of the majority of MEPs, shows just how great the divide is between our noble, elevated and worthy formal statements and the concrete reality in terms of our day-to-day policies when it comes to human rights. I believe that, as a beginning, Parliament is called upon to use the opportunity provided by the Geneva session to narrow that divide. It should adopt an approach that is not just a statement of principle but is an acknowledgement of the true situation and possibly even a pledge of support. We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished. The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention. In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law. It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed. Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts. The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed. I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court. In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally. We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual. By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations. In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded. Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process. Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world.	fr
I therefore believe that it is necessary to act in two ways. On the one hand, by asking the Commission, within the scope of aid to the fishing industry, to implement special measures to compensate for the effects of this catastrophe on the industry in the areas affected, and also by asking them to demand, of international bodies and of themselves, tight controls on ships which sail under flags of convenience. In this regard, the current process of negotiations on Malta' s accession to the European Union must be used to ensure that this country rigorously monitors the oil tankers which sail under its flag. On the other hand, prevention is essential. Portugal is a country which has clearly demonstrated its sensitivity to issues relating to the sea. I would ask the Portuguese Presidency to study the possibility of implementing a complete strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, using all the means at our disposal - technological, structural and socio-economic - to prevent a disaster such as this from happening again in the future. Lastly, Mr President, I would like to highlight the work carried out by the volunteers and local authorities, who reminded me of old times when, as the then Mayoress, I lived through similar situations. We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks. Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe. We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication. In addition, I should like to make a number of comments: First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied. That should be the starting point for our efforts. Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage. Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified. However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct. I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact. This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied.	de
It is my great pleasure to give the floor to the Prime Minster, António Guterres. I would like to thank the President-in-Office of the Council, Mr Antonio Guterres, and immediately give the floor to Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission. Madam President, I would first of all like to extend my warmest congratulations to Prime Minister Guterres for his initiative for the Lisbon Summit, and congratulate him on the quality of the preparatory work. We fully approve of the breakdown he presented to us, which received such an ovation, and we support his initiative. Together, we can make the Lisbon Summit a success. I will restrict myself in this speech to presenting the Commission' s contribution to Lisbon - our long-term strategy and our vision for this Summit. In Lisbon, very simply, we will have to decide whether Europe will be able to regain its leading role in the economic and technological worlds, relinquished long ago. This will depend on us, on whether we are able to boost the economic growth of the European system sufficiently, on the extent to which we are able to generate employment, on the level of education of our citizens and on the training we give our workers. These are familiar topics, as Prime Minister Guterres has said, but this summit is not going to be another Luxembourg, Cardiff or Cologne: we want to take a completely new approach to these issues, which we have already tackled in the past, and, rather than taking each one in isolation, deal with them collectively and, at last, create an intervention system. Now is the time to do this because there is currently a good chance of succeeding. In fact, this is a unique opportunity, and it is the result of the recent, successful implementation of a wise policy: inflation is low, the balance of payments is in a generally healthy state, public finances are in order and there is, at last, a unanimous forecast of strong economic growth, although, as the Portuguese Prime Minister stressed, this does not mean that economic growth is guaranteed. Never has this generation witnessed such a consensus of all the economic experts in Europe in forecasting strong and sustained growth. Even the rise in oil prices did not cause an increase in inflation or halt this economic expansion, as might have been expected. There are, nevertheless, a number of warning signs, but these are not of a nature to stop us proceeding with a development policy as we had intended and planned to do. The challenges awaiting us in Lisbon are therefore very simple: we must meet the challenge of technology by regaining lost ground in the areas of knowledge and technical skills, especially retraining technologies. This will put us back in the lead, and this is why we adopted the e-Europe initiative, which prompted the Commission to set a practical example in its administrative reform. We committed ourselves, and I confirm this commitment before this House, to creating a Commission, or perhaps I should say an e-Commission, in which all correspondence regarding supplies, research etc. relating to this institution will no longer be dealt with on paper but will all be carried out directly by e-mail.	it
There was a great deal of public investment at Federal, State and local levels. These were huge investments, and they were in modern infrastructures. I warn you that here our direct, and I stress, direct commitment at public and the other different levels is to build telecommunications highways, the roads for these new vehicles to run on. The market, private individuals and companies will build the vehicles, but it is our responsibility to build the new highways. With regard to what Mr Guterres has said about Internet access in every school, on the network connecting all the peripheral areas, this is not an obligation which can be left exclusively to the market because, quite simply, the market does not operate like this and, on the other hand, without this we will not attain the new and requisite targets for production development. Our problem is therefore that of avoiding a crisis in peripheral economies, which does not mean centralisation, nor a centralised programme, but giving peripheral economies the same chances that we give centralised economies. This, therefore, is why the programme must be directed at schools; this is why we must take an entire year group and insist that in that year there is no-one who does not receive Internet training. There is therefore a very clear strategy for Lisbon. Basically, in Lisbon, we need to revitalise employment and growth, confident in our ability to succeed, and we must therefore move towards this model which is based on stable balance. To return to today' s debate, I would like to pick up on an expression which was used by one of the MEPs, Mr Goebbels, who, if I am not mistaken, said that Europe is suffering from a 'deficit of the future.' The problem is simple. We cried on each other' s shoulders for such a long time, but during this time the seeds of what we had sown with such sacrifice in the early days of Europe were preparing to bear fruit. Now, let us please endeavour to make good the deficit of the future and give the coming generations a sense of direction, in the knowledge that we are working together, slowly but surely, to achieve something which will last. It is clear that, at this point, the three processes have to be combined. Unfortunately, our terminology is nightmarish, but let us genuinely group macroeconomic issues and labour and structural problems together, right now, and we will then be able to achieve the results we desire through very simple, specific measures. Remember the European company: we have not yet reached unanimity over the European company, but hundreds of thousands of companies are demanding it. It must be accomplished at all costs, because, quite simply, the idea of operating in fifteen different countries which, at this stage, are in any case metamorphosing into one single country, with different rules governing basic business principles, is not viable: we will not be able to sell it because it does not make sense. The same applies to the Community patent - for we will not be able to sell that either - to procurement rules and the capital market and to the beginnings of the coordination of social security, because there is no point in us dreaming up great expectations of mobility or developing such successful programmes as ERASMUS or SOCRATES to make people more mobile, if our social security rules do not then support this mobility.	es
Commissioner, it is impossible to overstate the importance of this reform. It transcends competition, it transcends the cohesion of the internal market. I believe that it profoundly affects the meaning of European integration, the meaning of the legitimacy of European integration. Therefore, Commissioner, we are relying on this interinstitutional dialogue to put the finishing touches to a reform which we are all hoping for and which we believe will lead us to a successful conclusion under your direction and with our cooperation. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I heartily congratulate the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs and the entire European Parliament for the great deal of interest shown in competition-related subjects. In my opinion, Mr President, this joint debate fully bears this out. We have heard some very thorough observations which both concern the philosophy of economic policy and are important for the institutional order. Our common aim is to reform and strengthen competition policy, a pillar of the social market economy and of European construction. The guiding thread running through all the aspects of the reform of competition policy, which we shall have the opportunity to address together, aims to ensure more effective protection of competition, reduce the bureaucratic burden weighing down businesses and take decision-making processes closer to the European people. I, personally, would sincerely like to thank Mr von Wogau for his commitment in examining the dossier on the White Paper and for the quality of his report. I would like to divide the considerations raised during this debate on the von Wogau report into four groups. I do not consider these considerations to be criticisms of the Commission, but, on the contrary, fundamental contributions, since justified concerns have been expressed that we both want to overcome. The groups are: the efficiency of the rules, the risk of renationalisation, consistent application of the rules and legal certainty. I will take these very quickly one at a time. Efficiency: I am convinced that this reform will strengthen the protection of competition within the single market rather than weaken it. The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter. The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals. The question of renationalisation: first of all, although it is not really necessary, I would like to point out and stress, several times if I may, that the White Paper does not affect mergers or State aid in the slightest - we are not looking for devolution in these areas - but that, as far as Regulation 17 is concerned, there is a risk of renationalisation.	es
"We know what actually happened. Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old. We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea. This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium. Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the ""polluter pays"" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate ""natural disasters"" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds. I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning. It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time. We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation. However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that. In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response. Many thanks for this. This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best. The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money. Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members. During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more."	fr
The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question. By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases. The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services. Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service. Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts. The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland. It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that. I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so. I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece. But they might accidentally do great damage. The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place. If too low a limit were set for the continuing monopoly right of the postal service, it would become uneconomical to maintain in the outlying areas universality of service at what would remain an affordable rate. The critical thing is to balance universality and affordability. The message that is coming very clearly from all sides of the House to the Commission today is that the Commission should tread warily. The Commission should not, for example, take a stepwise jump from 350 grammes to, as some have suggested, as low as 50 grammes. On the contrary, it should proceed cautiously. I imagine anything less than 150 grammes would be extremely unwise in these circumstances. The solidarity and cohesion of people all over Europe depend on the thought that you can post a letter anywhere and it will be delivered anywhere else, at an affordable stamp price. Stand by universality and affordability! Mr President, the only way to guarantee a high-quality universal postal service is to keep this as a public service. A universal service offering high-quality postal services at affordable prices throughout the country forms the basis for the operation of the whole postal system and must lead to a uniform nationwide tariff. This service must therefore be kept public. This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators.	es
Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity. But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support. Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed. The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system. Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce. Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system. Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are. In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties. On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States. Therefore, on behalf of my group, I would like to say that we support the Theato report; I nevertheless think that this is essentially a subject that should be included on the IGC agenda. Mr President, Mrs Theato' s report on the protection of the European Union' s financial interests proposes centralising criminal proceedings by initially creating a European Public Prosecutor. This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state. But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters. Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms. According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF. At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court.	es
I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility. In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies. I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal. The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing. The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition. As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes. Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business. Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period. With what aim? Not to save jobs. All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies. Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse. Did these firms need state aid to survive? No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years. State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders. It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed. In voting against the Jonckheer report, I wish to assert the need for another policy, to wit, ceasing all aid to private firms and utilising the money thereby saved to develop public services and recruit staff. Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market. In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition.	fr
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand. I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about. May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly. If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen. Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates. What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible! Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones. A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view. Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times. This time, however, it is true. We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement. The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not. Will we enlarge with or without deep reform? That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method. It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place. That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand. The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	it
The crisis in the Commission was, in fact, a crucial point in the relationship between Europe and its citizens, and the low turnout at the European elections was a worrying indication of this. Even stronger still, however, is the sense of insecurity, the feeling of being unprepared in a new world that is moving forwards, a world which is completely changing, where globalisation will even end up changing our points of reference. This is not the first time this has happened: Europe was once confronted with a similar transformation, an explosion of its markets, a change in its points of reference and a different view of the world. I am referring to the sixteenth century when the discovery of America turned everything upside down. Some countries - such as France and Spain - managed to meet the challenge, giving rise to great nation States; other countries - such as Italy - did not meet this challenge and lost all the headway that they had accumulated during the first part of that millennium: headway in science, technology, economic progress, defence structures and military organisation, philosophy and literature. Today, Europe is facing a similar challenge, and we know that, just as history has been unforgiving in the past, it will not be forgiving in the present. In this context of wholesale change, and in order to prevent our nation States vanishing again, in the wake of globalisation which is creating hitherto unprecedented scales and challenges, Europe needs to be economically strong, because globalisation demands unity, because every day we hear news of new agreements at world level and news of changes at European level too. But more vital still is a Europe that feels strong in the political arena. In years past, the single market and the single currency have been the pivotal point of our actions, the mainstay of European life. Today, the new frontiers of European integration are political frontiers: common foreign and security policy, justice and internal security, and - to a lesser extent - the crucial question of the fundamental political values on which our coexistence is based. The Commission has therefore adopted the strategic programme for 2000-2005, a programme that was immediately sent to the European Parliament and with which you are already familiar, so I will not go into detail about it now. Some of you may find it lacks detail, but no political structure sets out detailed five-year programmes. This is the European Union, not the Soviet Union. Our programme highlights the major points of reference, the major areas for action: firstly, the development of new forms of governance for Europe; secondly, extension and enlargement of the area of peace, freedom, and security; thirdly, the launch of a new stage in the growth of the economy; fourthly, safeguarding and improving quality of life. These will be our major guidelines for action over the next five years. With regard to the first area - new forms of governance for Europe - you already know that the Commission has undertaken to produce a White Paper and not a full legislative text since, in the light of major issues which are changing the structure of the way we interact, the Commission is first of all preparing for a debate; we will subsequently discuss the content with you; this will give rise to a policy document, and finally, a legislative document.	it
For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies. In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle. . I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate. I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion. We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence. This discussion is not new. We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence. I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda. This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission. I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything. I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them. Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate. I would, however, warn against the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of a mechanical deficiency in the system. This exists, but it is only a small part of what we are discussing. The major part of it has to do with well known established differences of interest between sexes and so on, and this is the problem. Mr Mulder mentioned that no farmer will start producing anything if the price is too low. This is true in our part of the world, but our partners and beneficiaries in Africa have a slightly different perspective. They farm, not just for a living, but in order to live, and this makes a difference.	fr
We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas. It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health. So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it. Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence. Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power. We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for? The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists. I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority? How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority? If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way? These are my three questions. . Yes, Mr President, that is true. There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management. They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case. However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle. It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete. That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science. It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base. We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future. You have to see this as a tool for risk management. You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available. You have to assess all that and evaluate the science. Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not. So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today.	it
"As Amendment No 18 refers to Directive 96/71 concerning the minimum wage which is already in force, no change is necessary. Acceptance of Amendment No 17 by the Commission would mean that a simple duty of notification would apply if no valid card is issued. Surely this is contrary to interests of public order within the Member States. Amendment No 19 is also unacceptable, given my thoughts on Amendment No 10. The Commission has the same opinion of similar amendments to the second proposal. I would like to add that Amendment No 10 to that proposal is wholly acceptable. As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term ""self-employed"" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged. I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark. He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders. This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance. With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country. The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries. The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way. In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate. On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point. I will keep myself free in this connection. Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger. Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m. Court of First Instance Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision. However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts. For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho. Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon."	it
Mr President, the Commission's proposal on further gradual and controlled liberalisation of postal services has been delayed mainly because of the reorganisation and reallocation of duties within the Commission and the fact that the new Commission needs to re-examine the issues involved. With regard to Parliament's various resolutions on the postal sector, my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, has already responded to some of the main points at the hearings which Parliament held last year. Furthermore, as regards consultations with Parliament, Commissioner Bolkestein will meet the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism next Monday. The studies were sent to the committee and to the MEPs who requested them, in September 1999 and are, in any case, still available. They can also be consulted on the Commission's Internet website. I am sure Commissioner Bolkestein will listen carefully to all Parliament's comments. The Commission is firmly convinced of the need to prepare a new proposal on developing the postal sector. Furthermore, the submission of a proposal is a legal obligation. I can confirm that it is Commissioner Bolkestein' s firm intention to present a proposal to the Commission by the middle of the year, to be forwarded to Parliament and the Council. The date set for completing the next phase, which the Commission intends to keep to, is 1 January 2003. The proposal will take account of the studies and, in particular, the need to maintain a universal service, to develop efficient safeguards for consumers, to create a climate favourable to new jobs and to solve any problems relating to competition. The role of liberalisation in modernising and improving postal services throughout the Union with the help of new technologies will be examined in order to identify potential benefits for the industry as a whole. The proposal, when it is put forward, will take account of the points of view of Member States, Parliament, users, universal service providers and their competitors and by other interested parties, all of whom have been involved in an in-depth consultation process. The aim is to ensure that the internal market in postal services functions smoothly in the interests of consumers and businesses throughout the European Union. Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak. I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members. Mr President, there is a mystery. What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997? There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now. I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today. I am very fond of him. He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners. It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues. There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive. Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties. That has only happened recently.	it
This second option has won the day and I am pleased about this. However, in the future I hope that the coordination between these two institutions and the Council can be improved so that our work is more understandable and more productive. Mr President, our objective in setting a framework for unit trusts and other UCTIS is to secure the highest possible safe return for our savers, which is why I want to address the issue of derivatives in my remarks today. I firmly believe that the prudent use of derivatives can help fund secure, safer, higher returns. Despite their image of danger, derivatives are usually used by asset managers as insurance. A contract that, for example, pays a substantial sum if, say, the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index falls, causes an extra payment by the investor if the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 share index rises. Is this speculative? Not at all. Imagine you have spent some months building up a portfolio of shares in companies in which you are confident: they have good management, good prospects and they are good investments. Then you become worried that the whole stock market is going to collapse, as it did in 1987. You have the option of selling off everything and getting into cash, but that would be to waste your research into the winners. It would also incur all the transaction costs of selling your shares and then buying them again after the fall. The solution is to take out a derivative which pays off if the NASDAQ or CAC 40 falls. But even with a tailor-made derivative or OTC derivative which would be cheaper, perhaps insuring you against a relative fall in your portfolio against the index, you would still have the portfolio and the shares, but you would have protected yourself against the risks of a collapse. In exchange, you might also have given up some of the upside of the markets. In this case, which is perhaps the most common use of derivatives by asset managers, you reduce your potential reward but you also reduce your potential risk. That is a desirable development in a soundly managed fund. History demonstrates that investors benefit from a liberal and light-handed approach to regulation. Heavy-handedness - a prescription of how private sector managers should invest and where they should invest - will merely reduce returns to savers. Pension funds which suffered from rules on where they could and could not invest, as required by of our government bonds, made returns of 5.2% a year, barely half the 9.5% annual returns made by free funds between 1984 and 1996. These are of course the returns after deducting all losses. Do not confuse a real concern for the interests of investors with a populist fear of the new and the innovative and liberal approach that pays off. This is what we should be concerned about here today. Mr President, the report presented to us today seeks to complete the free movement of financial investments in Europe, including the most sophisticated forms of investment.	es
What can the European Union do, without interfering in internal affairs in Cyprus, to promote a fair and viable solution to this drastic problem in a country which has been associated with the European Community for nearly 30 years and which is due to join the Union within the next few years? I have listened to the somewhat equivocal talk and silences on the part of the Council which, in my view, need clarifying. I think that we need, first and foremost, to bear the main point of reference for any international community in such cases in mind, i.e. the resolutions of the United Nations. The Security Council feels that the solution to the Cypriot problem should be sought within the framework of a two-zone, twin-community federation, in other words a single state, as Mr Verheugen mentioned, consisting of two local administrations elected by the two communities. Cyprus should be one sovereign state, with a single international personality and single citizenship and this state should be demilitarised. The international community has thus indicated that it rejects any act accomplished by force. Secondly, the European Union stands to gain, in my view, by minimising the scope for interpretation of the position laid down by the Helsinki European Council. The solution to the Cypriot problem cannot be a precondition to Cyprus' s accession to the Union, as Mr Poos has reminded us. If it were, Turkey would have a sort of right of veto over the accession of Cyprus to the European Union, which is, of course, unacceptable. Thirdly, we must not, in turn, allow the position taken by the Helsinki European Council to temper our efforts to resolve the Cypriot question before Cyprus joins the Union. From this point of view, the other decision taken at Helsinki, namely to grant Turkey candidate status, gives the Fifteen new responsibilities as well as new possibilities and its dialogue with Ankara can and, in my view, should, include a determination to ensure that Turkey demonstrates a constructive attitude towards dialogue between the two Cypriot communities which respects international law and which will ultimately lead to a united Cyprus and peace in the eastern Mediterranean. Mr President, there is a general consensus of opinion that financial aid to Cyprus and Malta is important. The big question, however, is from what budget heading should this aid be financed? The Council and Commission have suggested deleting the protocols under category 4. This is in line with the budget order issued by Parliament in December last. The rapporteur is now making reference to this and proposes classing Cyprus and Malta under category 7. The Committee on Budgetary Control has even suggested postponing approval of the Brok report until the Council agrees to increase the financial ceilings for category 7. This is an extremely risky strategy. In fact, the financial protocols cannot go ahead without a vote in Parliament. Cyprus and Malta will thus become the victims of a political game between the Council and Parliament regarding the height of the ceilings.	it
We note your concern and will pass this on through the appropriate channels. Violence between ethnic groups in Mitrovica and Albanian prisoners in Serbia, notably the plight of Mrs Flora Brovina  Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons. First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender. I have no doubt, and I am sure that you have no doubt, that this is a major new contribution on his part to the fight against racism and intolerance. The other reason is that this text does not, unfortunately, go very far. I think that it manages, through a series of clever devices, to carefully avoid addressing the central issue, i.e. the final status of Kosovo. I doubt that any of you still believe that Kosovo can one day become part of Yugoslavia. I also doubt that any of you can believe that Milosevic could resist for very long if the international community eventually resolved the question of the final status of Kosovo. I also doubt that any of you think that, as things stand, it is not in Milosevic' s interest to pull out all the stops and destabilise Kosovo, as he is doing and as we have seen. Finally, I do not think that any of you believe that the present status quo will bring minimum stability and hence minimum development to Kosovo. I also noted a mistake in the compromise motion for a resolution, which you no doubt overlooked. You condemn the first direct attack on the KFOR troops. I would not want you to be birds of ill omen, but I fear that, by failing to confront the real issue, you will end up being just that and I shall hold you entirely responsible for what may happen. On the contrary, I think it is our duty to call on the Commission and the Council, which unfortunately is not present, to insist that the United Nations consider the question of the final status of Kosovo, of the multiplicity of micro-states in the region, of what happens post-Dayton and, finally, the question of real stability which can allow democracy to be built up in these countries and give the European Union a policy in this region. Finally, I would stress that we have been asking the Council and the Commission since July to take forceful action to secure the release of the 3 000 Kosovar prisoners and Mrs Brovina, Mr Jurti and Mr Hoti. I note that the Union is preparing to lift certain sanctions and that we have not seen even one of these prisoners released in exchange. Why not? Mr President, what is happening in Mitrovica in Kosovo is appalling and reprehensible. Violence begets violence, and revenge begets revenge. The police forces which have been sent out do not have the manpower to stop what is going on. The Chief Commissioner of Police, Svend Frederiksen, has expressed his desperation at the fact that he constantly has to make do with less than half the manpower which was agreed.	de
I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals. The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals. The virus harms cold-blooded animals. It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested. In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption. As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee. During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation. I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry. You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture. The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument. Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks. I must emphasise, however, that there are serious constraints. Budgetary resources are very limited and priorities with other diseases have to be set. So further thought is necessary. I regret therefore that I am not at present in a position to accept amendments that refer to compensation through Decision 90/424. This is in particular the case for Amendments Nos 3 and 5. I agree, however, with the statement in Amendment No 2 saying that no compensation has been made payable to salmon farmers. I am not able to comment on the availability of commercial insurance. The Commission included in its proposal a possibility for vaccination of salmon. The intention of this proposal is to introduce a tool for combating the disease in emergency situations. I believe a vaccine should not be used for preventative purposes as suggested in Amendment No 4. Experience in other areas has shown that preventative vaccination has the adverse affect of creating healthy virus carriers. Those could perpetuate an infection. I therefore am not able to accept Amendment No 4. You also referred to the need for further scientific research on the nature of the disease. I agree that such research is needed and I understand this is at present being organised in the United Kingdom. I will follow very closely the results of this research and take it fully into account in future legislative proposals. It must be further examined whether and how scientific research in other parts of the Community must be organised. In this context I am happy to partly accept Amendment No 1, taking into account, however, that scientific investigations are not done by the Commission but that the Commission relies on results of investigations carried out in the Member States. I also can partly accept the part of Amendment No 6 saying that Directive 93/53 should be amended as a result of scientific and technical evidence. As I pointed out earlier, the available scientific evidence is that ISA is not a threat to health.	es
Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end. All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference. This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States. In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing. The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us. Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki. It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions. In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary. The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States. It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform. We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union. Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference. In theory, we could have done so. We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th. However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement. Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly. The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues. Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself. However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority. Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase. It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament.	it
That cannot continue. When we have a crisis we have to clearly identify in advance that if there is a problem, those responsible are liable. Mr President, it is a very worthwhile White Paper and you will not hear a word from me on the food safety authority. My questions relate to the positive list for animal feed. You are unclear about this in your White Paper. What is your schedule, how long will it take you to produce a positive list? When will the same requirements be applied to animal feed and the production thereof as apply to the production of food and the monitoring thereof? The final part of my question is as follows: when will BSE testing be binding in all Member States? That is another point, i.e. the question of obligation, which you were somewhat unclear on in your White Paper. Thank you, Commissioner, for your statement. I think the lines that you have set up regarding the Food Safety Authority are a recognition of reality. The Member States would not accept a regulatory agency, so there is not very much point in your proposing one. Some sectors of the food industry clearly need better regulation and that is clear on the issue of feed and animal feedingstuffs. However, as chairman of a committee which looks as though it will be concerning itself almost entirely with food over the next three years, I have to ask: if Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new directives and regulations and 20 new amending directives? Secondly, will this not compound the problem of over-regulation from Brussels and under-implementation in the Member States? We look forward to a fruitful dialogue with you on this. Regarding enlargement: what plans does the Commission have to involve the applicant states in debates on these new laws, given that the Commission clearly expects the laws envisaged in the White Paper to form part of the acquis communautaire by 2003? President, first of all I would like to thank Mrs Ahern, Mrs Roth-Behrendt and Mrs Jackson for their words of support in relation to the White Paper. I find that encouraging and I look forward to further discussions with them and other Members of Parliament in relation to the issues that they raised. Mrs Ahern raised the issue of liability. That of course is not specifically addressed in the White Paper except for the reference to the fact that we will be putting in place provisions - and there are already some - relating to the issue of traceability. Once that is done, issues such as liability can be addressed. I have not given full and detailed consideration to issues relating to and surrounding questions of liability despite my background, but it seems to me that there may very well be subsidiarity issues involved. But I have taken on board your suggestion and I will give it further consideration. Mrs Roth-Behrendt asked me about establishing a positive list. That is one of the issues that we address in the annex to the legislation, and the intention is to establish a positive list for feed material. At the moment the list is, as I say, a negative list and it is added to as required. The establishment of the positive list is one of the issues set out in the annex with a date attached to it, 2002 in fact. The rapid alert system for feed is something that we have identified as a gap in the legislation. Rapid alert is there for food but not for feed. This is unfortunate and it is wrong, and we believe that it is important to identify it and to establish legislation to close that gap and that will be done.	de
"In other words, there will have to be a quantum leap in development policy if the rich countries, including the EU countries, are not to surround themselves with barriers to prevent immigration on a massive scale. In a global village, major discrepancies in the world will not, in the longer term, be tolerated by the poorest section of the village. At some time or another, there will be a revolt, and it will be fully justified. I would therefore urge the Council' s Presidency to set the promised debate in motion as quickly as possible and, above all, to conclude it in such a way that we all of us, including the people of Europe, realise what globalisation means and understand that a central element will have to be radical changes in the nature and the level of the development aid we provide. The EU on average is far from providing the pledged 0.7%. It may well be that others are worse, but that does not place us in any better a light. Above all, however, we should give the countries concerned the opportunity to trade with us. As far as I could hear - but I may have missed something - the President-in-Office of the Council did not mention the word ""trade"" at all. I would just say to the Commissioner that I hope his proposal will be successfully adopted by the Commission and the Member States. I would also ask the Commissioner to give some concrete examples of sectoral interests which are holding matters up, not only in the Commission but also in the Member States. I should also like to say that, in my view, what would be most effective would be for Parliament to call for proposals from, respectively, the Development Council and the Commissioner for Development. In that way, we should perhaps have a basis for discussion, instead of receiving proposals from all the governments and from all over the Commission, which is scarcely likely to produce results. I shall conclude with a few words about the Internet revolution. As Commissioner Liikanen keeps saying on his travels, we have a head start here in Europe in the area of mobile telecommunications. Let us use this not only for the benefit of our own populations but also for that of the developing countries. This technology can facilitate that necessary quantum leap forward in development policy to which I referred and, in this connection, the EU can set the agenda, leave its mark on development and honour its global responsibilities. Mr President, ""The EU' s development cooperation leaves a great deal to be desired"" . This is just a quote from a newspaper article which appeared last week, commenting on the Union' s development policy. This is not new. Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question. Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror. Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally? One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict."	it
But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive. We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender. In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies. I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them. They also play a major role in maintaining links between people. As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities? Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas. Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation. The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs. We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe. Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999. That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved. These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects.	es
We are, therefore, in agreement with the report, Commissioner, as well as the broad outlines of the White Paper. Since the Treaty entered into force, Community law on competition has been one of the tenets of Community policy. After almost forty years of being in force, these rules were beginning to show signs of exhaustion. For this reason, modernisation was essential. That modernisation came to be particularly necessary for five reasons. Firstly, the authorisation system; secondly, decentralised application; thirdly, procedural rules; fourthly, judicial application; and fifthly and finally, excessive red tape. The system of individual approvals needed urgent reform, as was unanimously requested by specialised companies, academics and lawyers. I have not attended a single forum of specialists in competition law which has not requested a change to the system. A system, such as the current one, which is capable of making so few decisions, be they approvals or prohibitions, is something less than a valid system. National competition authorities were able to apply Articles 81(1) and 82 for some time. However, they could not apply Article 81(3), which, to a certain extent, prevented the coherent application of Article 81(1). You will know that there are currently two preliminary issues before the Court of Justice, both brought by German courts, which question the feasibility of applying 81(1) without being able to apply 81(3). A reform of this point was therefore also necessary. The procedure in the field of competition is basically contained in Regulation 1762. The voices in favour of its amendment were unanimous. The fact that it did not establish a genuine procedure, that it did not establish time limits, that it did not regulate access for interested parties to the files, or that the right to defence was not properly recognised, were factors which led to the unanimous demand for reform. The Court of Justice accepted some time ago that Community competition law could be applied by the legal bodies of the Member States and in 1994, the Commission published a communication on this subject. It was therefore necessary to facilitate this approach. One of the most frequent criticisms of Community competition law is its excessive red tape. As a consequence of the continental legal tradition, consideration of whether certain agreements are anti-competitive or not depends more on an analysis of their clauses than on their effects on the market. It was therefore necessary to introduce an economic analysis. The White Paper intends to resolve these problems and we therefore support these proposals. It is also true that we note certain deficiencies which have come to light in the report. Amongst these, firstly, is the fact that, despite trying to modernise Articles 81 and 82, Article 81 and not Article 82 carries exclusive weight. At the moment, with inter-company agreements and the privatisation of monopolies preserving dominant positions and even consolidating them, the combating of abusive conduct is becoming particularly important. Secondly, Regulation 1762 must be repealed and replaced with a new regulation. For these reasons, we are going to vote in favour of the report.	it
After all, it is responsible for technical measures to protect against counterfeiting. As has also been pointed out, in summer 1998 the Commission submitted a communication listing a very wide variety of areas where measures need to be taken, such as information, further training - an important area, cooperation between the euro-states and of course even beyond them, and measures under criminal law. That is what this framework decision is about. Mrs Cederschiöld, let me offer you sincere thanks on behalf of the Commission and, above all, let me also thank Parliament for being prepared to give its position in the space of such a short time. I certainly appreciate that. The framework decision aims to ensure that the Member States apply the same definition of counterfeiting offences. Of course the first condition for uniform action is always to have uniform definitions and, as was emphasised, what we are basically trying to do is to ensure that the euro is protected even before it is physically introduced. Naturally, the Commission is also glad that the European Parliament' s prompt decision - and I hope the vote will be in favour - means the framework decision can enter into force very rapidly now, so that we can begin to transpose it. For the Commission has been asked to report, as it will in the first half of next year, on the progress in transposing it in the Member States, on whether the serious nature of this issue is being matched by serious action. It has been pointed out that this framework decision is in fact a decision in the area of criminal law. In that respect we must recognise this innovation, this step, even if, as Mr Schulz just pointed out, simply supplementing a rather old convention is not really a particularly bold step. In reply to the question whether the Commission considers that the framework decision has an adequate legal basis under the Treaty, the Commission believes that the right basis is being applied here. The framework decision will, however, have to be supplemented by other legal acts in future. The Commission will submit a proposal for a regulation on cooperation between all the responsible authorities and on cooperation with Europol. That proposal will establish a duty to cooperate, and a duty on the part of the national authorities to notify Europol of cases of counterfeiting and to present any confiscated counterfeit money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, so that effective measures can then be taken. On the question of coordinating the various measures, since early 1998, the Commission, followed now by OLAF, has been working with experts on the subject from the Member States, the European Central Bank and Europol on means of effectively combating counterfeiting of the euro in advance. As Mr Karas just pointed out, a few weeks ago the Commission submitted a proposal for an information campaign on the euro, to which it proposed allocating as much as EUR 32 million. That is a volume of funding that can be put to very effective use, a large amount; and of course the information campaign will also focus very strongly on protecting the euro against counterfeiting.	fr
It therefore follows that any proposal which suggests major reform of the machinery for competition policy enforcement must be closely and carefully examined. The truth is that the single market is not yet complete. During my six months as a Member of this Parliament, I have become acutely aware of the determination of many Members to drive forward what is described as the European project. We daily hear the need to promote a wider and deeper Europe. But all this, in effect, is so much rhetoric when we look at the national, regional and local obstacles which continue to block the operation of a true European single market. That is the context in which I want to consider the Commission's proposals. I should like to make it clear that we have the greatest confidence in and respect for Commissioner Monti. We look to him as the man to root out cartels. But he would recognise that, as for everybody else, we have to consider his particular proposals and subject them to rigorous examination. That is something that has been done by our rapporteur on the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, Mr von Wogau. I want to congratulate him, sadly in his absence, for the thorough and rigorous way in which he has undertaken the preparation of his report - and also for putting up with my being such a thorn in his side! He mentioned earlier that the report was carried with a significant majority but not with my support. So although I may not share his conclusions, I believe he has illustrated in his report many of the issues which the Commission must address. The first is the potential for renationalisation of competition policy. I know that the Commission is set against this, but the potential exists. I remain worried about the capacity of national courts and the capacity of the national competition authorities. I remain worried about the whole operation of the judicial process. I asked Commissioner Monti the other day what happens if he proves to be wrong and there is an effective renationalisation. Mr von Wogau said we can look to the European Court. Well, we in Britain are looking to the European Court at the moment. We find that the European Court is not able to provide us with interim measures in a certain dispute that we have with France at the moment, in which we have the support of the Commission. Unless anybody thinks that this is merely a nationalistic point, in the Factortame case, in which the British Government was the defendant, it took ten years for the European Court to give a ruling. So, judicially, something needs to be done. I ask the Commission what can be done to speed up implementation in this particular area. In relation to legal certainty, I endorse the point made by Mrs Thyssen. It is important that business has legal certainty. I mentioned this again to Commissioner Monti recently. He said we must not always be carried along by lawyers.	fr
"Finally, it needs to be borne in mind that - whatever happens - the real solution to the problems of comitology for the European Parliament is still to change the procedure for implementing legislation laid down in the Treaties, and gradually to dismantle the committees whose existence represents an anomaly that severely restricts the Commission' s executive power and may prejudice the European Parliament' s legislative powers. Mr President, comitology is a concept most people do not know how to handle and hardly anyone knows what it means. It makes them think of secret societies and conspiracies, which is the way things used to be. In fact, it implies nothing other than fixing the procedures for the exercise of the implementing powers conferred on the Commission. The procedures for exercising these implementing powers take the form of a limited number of committee procedures. Up until the Amsterdam Treaty, there were about 20 variations of these committee procedures, which created neither clarity in the implementation of legislation nor transparency for the citizens. On the contrary, for a long time even the European Parliament was not informed. For the European Parliament, the first step in the struggle for more transparency in this jungle of committees was to be informed, at least, of all that the European Commission intended to regulate in the context of these various committees. Agreement was reached in 1988 in the form of an exchange of letters between Lord Plumb and Mr Delors. A further step towards transparency and the involvement of the European Parliament came with what is known as the modus vivendi of 20 September 1994, which granted Parliament the right not only to be informed but also to intervene in certain cases. It also gave it the possibility of scrutiny. With the Amsterdam Treaty, the situation improved decidedly when the number of committee procedures was drastically reduced - as the European Parliament had long wanted - to three procedures, the administrative procedure, the regulatory procedure and the advisory procedure. Now, following the Amsterdam Treaty, the rights of information and control granted to the European Parliament in the past need to be enshrined anew in an interinstitutional agreement. Mrs Frassoni, our rapporteur, has done very careful work and identified the questions that have to be clarified in the context of that interinstitutional agreement and the administrative procedures that may have to be changed within Parliament. A key problem is the time factor. When the European Parliament is informed, it generally has to adopt a position within the very short timeframe of four weeks, should it so wish. In matters relating to the health and safety of the people of the European Union, the European Commission, as guardian of the Treaties and the only institution with the right of initiative, must be in a position to react very rapidly, if necessary within a few hours or days. Nevertheless, the European Parliament must retain the right to be informed and where appropriate also to react. Our rapporteur identifies very useful solutions to these difficulties, which I and my group can only support in full. I just have one more request. In the German version, paragraph 2 of the resolution has been translated rather misleadingly and I urgently ask for clarification, which I would also like to see in the printed version later. In my view, instead of ""weitergeführt werden müssen"" the wording should be ""erhalten bleiben müssen"" ."	de
This proposal is radically opposed to the spirit of the current system in which the criminal law and criminal proceedings that lie at the heart of the national legal systems must come under the sovereignty of each nation and lie within the exclusive competence of each state. But the idea of a European Public Prosecutor, on the other hand, aims in the long term to confine the national states to a subordinate role in these matters. Moreover, this proposal is liable to set off a chain reaction of totally unforeseen reforms. According to the Theato report, the European Public Prosecutor is needed, in particular, in order to better support the inquiries of the anti-fraud office, OLAF. At the same time, however, we see from the van Hulten report under discussion today that the European Public Prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a European Union court. In this way, a small European reform may hide a medium-sized one, and a medium-sized one may hide a large one. Not to mention that the large one may hide a gigantic one, as the very next thing we will see is a proposal for a European criminal law and then, why not a European Minister of Justice, supervised by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament? I therefore feel we must carefully consider the balance of power that we are in danger of upsetting if we put forward this type of reform, which appears to be quite specific. In the final analysis, we feel that proposals such as the proposal for a European Public Prosecutor demonstrate an inability to conceive of a Europe in anything other than a centralised and hierarchical form, organised around a superstate. The Union for a Europe of Nations Group, on the other hand, wishes to see a polycentric Europe with nations linked in a network. And such a network could take the form of improved coordination between national public prosecution authorities, for example, and the creation, if necessary, of national teams specialising in offences involving Community finances. So the legal framework, Mr President, is already in place. It is fine, in principle. It need only be fine-tuned. Mr President, Mrs Theato is proposing institutional revolution for a twofold reason. Public opinion, although indifferent to 20 million unemployed and thousands of mad cows, is now supposed to be worried about the fraud endangering financial interests and these two reasons are supposed to justify a twofold solution: a European criminal code with crimes against the Community and a European Prosecutor-General. Mrs Theato probably forgot to include a European prison now that we have the FBI, the European police, in the form of OLAF. All this would be established by two regulations, one for the Public Prosecutor and another for the criminal code. The regulations would be adopted pursuant to Article 280 of the Treaty, i.e. based on secondary law, whose characteristic feature is that it makes any sort of secondary shift of emphasis possible. And indeed there is a twofold shift. Firstly, the classic Eurofederalist ideological shift, a single market, a single VAT, a single diplomatic service, a single army and now a single criminal code and a single public prosecutor. All this to combat fraud worth less than EUR 1 billion, while disregarding the tens of billions of euros lost due to the Generalised System of Preferences, free trade areas, customs presents to Chiquita and the billions lost to the fourth resource, GDP, as a result of the budgetary rationing pact.	de
Things could well continue in the same way. Commissioner, as time is very short, I would like to pick out the seven points which we feel, and you have already mentioned some of them, are essential to work on: double-hulled vessels in our waters as soon as possible and the strictest possible state control of ports. In particular, we must ensure that classification societies are compelled to make their reports public, as currently, we do not have access to them. Then, sanctions must be harmonised between the 15 Member States; they should not be different, but the same throughout the Union. We must be tougher on vessels flying flags of convenience, not because they are necessarily bad boats, but because amongst these boats there are many bad ones. We must improve information on all of the world' s ships, but provision has already been made for this. We must also target those responsible and take a tougher line with them. With regard to this matter, I would like to know who owns the Erika, because the idea of a legal person under our law is one thing, but there are always real shareholders in the background. Where are the Erika' s owners? Perhaps they are in lovely villas by lovely beaches, getting a nice tan. We would like to know their names and their faces. Finally, there must be improvements in the training of crews. In our society there is no such thing as zero-risk, but we must at least ensure the greatest possible levels of safety. Mr President, I welcome the statement from the Commissioner. Having spent a lot of time at sea myself I am well aware of the sea's power and destructive force, which make a proper design and maintenance of ships and boats essential. I would like to express my sympathy with all those who are dealing with the consequences of the breaking up and sinking of the oil tanker Erika. This has been an environmental disaster as well as a deplorable waste of resources. It should be noted that the oil industry, through the International Oil Pollution Compensation Funds, regards itself as liable under the 1969 Convention and its 1992 Protocol, for over 90% of the estimated cost of this incident, or some USD 170 million. This suggests to me that we should also look to the shipowners, to the flag state and the inspection authorities to shoulder their share of the responsibility. However, before we rush in with a whole raft of new measures and new regulations, let us look carefully at the existing arrangements to be sure that they are being properly implemented. Better to heed calls to amend and improve existing legislation than to embark on new proposals. In that context I support calls to strengthen port state control to ensure full and effective inspection. I support calls to ensure that the classification societies effectively monitor vessels' structural conditions and are held accountable for their actions. Calls for design improvements in hull construction, especially double-hulled vessels, are sensible but take time to be implemented throughout the fleet.	it
We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians. I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life. These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated. I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again. It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo. What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together. We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough. We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights. All of this needs to happen, and quickly too. If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise. That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available. Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary. . (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue. This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned. I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate. Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward. However, in moving forward, what should we be financing? This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement. In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5. In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are. We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties.	de
"Let us not forget that, in 1999, 717,000 people came here to compensate for our low birth rate. In social terms, it is therefore absolutely essential that we have an immigration policy with a social conscience, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain. We must be very aware of the situation of those people whose prospects of finding work are threatened or reduced by economic changes, mergers, take-overs, new technologies etc. What is required here is a training policy to qualify and prepare people for new jobs, for those who already have a job and for those who need a second opportunity, because sometimes, as the title of the film states, the postman always rings twice. In my humble opinion, it is the responsibility of all European, national and regional governments to ensure that he rings on more than one occasion. It seems to me, Commissioner, that the Commission has the responsibility to promote and coordinate these opportunities. Mr President, I should like to congratulate Mr Andersson on his really excellent work, which is the reason why there is broader agreement, and I also thank the Members of Parliament involved for their contribution. I would like to make a number of comments about what has been said. First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: ""The future of social protection"" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk. Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson. I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection. The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate. You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States. The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies. The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken. As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June. The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession. I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group. Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion."	de
TOPICAL AND URGENT DEBATE The next item is the debate on topical and urgent subjects of major importance. Racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain) The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0149/2000 by Mr Galeote Quecedo and others, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, on outbreaks of racism and xenophobia in the El Ejido area in Spain; B5-0159/2000 by Mr Gasòliba i Böhm and Mr Sánchez García, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, on racist and xenophobic incidents in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0162/2000 by Mrs Díez González and others, on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, on the outbursts of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0169/2000 by Mr Puerta and others, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, on outbursts of xenophobia in El Ejido (Spain); B5-0175/2000 by Mr Bautista Ojeda and others, on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, on xenophobia-related incidents in El Ejido (Spain). Mr President, I am reassured by the fact that the first three speakers in this debate are intimate with this situation given our African origin. I must firstly congratulate the groups in this House on the high degree of consensus achieved in the motion for a resolution. I am aware of the efforts made by Members to avoid using an issue such as this for electoral purposes. Secondly, I must also assert my total conviction that neither Spain nor Andalusia is xenophobic or racist. Of course this does not mean that I do not totally condemn the violence used by individuals or groups who deserve to be prosecuted firmly and rigorously by the law, and by the law alone. We should be tackling the issue of immigration in a comprehensive and rigorous manner. These events, which are unfortunately overshadowing the political decisions in this area, confirm without doubt that the development of the Tampere Agreements and Title IV of the EC Treaty must be an urgent priority. Today' s problems cannot be solved in five years. They will take a long time, as we are finding out. The legislation of the Member States must be brought into line with the agreements of the governments in Tampere, as paragraph 7 of the motion states. Legal immigrants must be integrated socially without any excuses or delays. Furthermore, the labour market must be organised realistically so that jobs held by third country nationals are subject to labour legislation on wages, social security and social protection in terms of equality. This will eradicate the labour exploitation and markets in marginalised people, which are resulting in the events condemned by the motion, and which are the real basis of the current social problem. Solidarity, dialogue and agreements between local, regional, national and European institutions and employers, unions and the immigrant communities themselves, whose countries of origin must also undoubtedly assume some responsibility, are essential.	es
In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand. I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about. May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly. If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen. Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates. What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible! Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones. A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view. Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times. This time, however, it is true. We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement. The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not. Will we enlarge with or without deep reform? That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method. It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place. That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand. The Council must realise that, if we want the future of the European Union to involve a form of enlargement built on firm foundations, the next Intergovernmental Conference must go much further.	fr
We are left with Article 11(1) which says that the appropriations of the funds may not replace public or other equivalent structural expenditure by the Member States. Very well: that is to be the unchanging rule. Does section 11(1) conceivably authorise the following practice. When an autonomous region's or country's funding from European structural funds increases, the state makes a concomitant reduction in central funding to that region, so that the total funding package available matches a formula set nationally without regard to the quantum of structural funds granted by the Union. Is that really authorised? - Additionality is a major issue too in Wales, which I represent. Just last week it was one of the issues that brought about a vote of no-confidence and the resignation of the First Secretary of the National Assembly of Wales. As recently as 1991 and 1992 the Commission won a battle with the UK over additionality, at that time linked to the RECHAR funding. This led to an agreement being signed whereby the UK Government agreed to introduce procedures to ensure that EU spending reached the areas for which is was intended and was actually additional. And yet we still have these problems in Wales and in Scotland. Could the Commission look at this particular situation in relation to the agreement that was signed with the UK Government? I take this to mean that the debate of which I was aware in Scotland is also occurring in Wales. I will verify this point and, if you wish, I will give you a written answer at the same time as the one I have promised to Mr MacCormick. Mr President, I will try to be brief in answering the Member' s question. The regional development plan submitted by the Spanish authorities on 29 October does not indicate how the Community funds will be allocated among the Spanish Objective 1 regions and therefore what your region of Andalusia will receive. As I did not fully understand the plan, I contacted the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs, Mr Rato, in a letter of 14 December which I have here, to ask him for more information on the document submitted. In the coming weeks, the Commission will start negotiations with the Spanish authorities with a view to drawing up the Community support framework for the new period of 2000-2006. During these meetings I can assure you that the Commission will obtain the clarifications required on the regional allocation. Therefore, if you wish, as soon as I have this information by sector and region, I will personally send you the information on Andalusia. Mr Commissioner, the problem is that when Mr Aznar comes to the European Union to receive money for all the people of Andalusia, he counts all of them, but when he goes to the Andalusia Council to pay for services, he fails to notice 400 000 Andalusians, and this is very serious, because 400 000 children are the equivalent to the whole of Strasbourg or a city larger than Granada, full of children.	it
The text of the proposal for a Regulation has been amended quite extensively in the Committee on Fisheries. All the members of our Group voted in favour of these amendments, both in committee and in Parliament. Amendment No 1 serves to clarify the text considerably. Specifically, the data collected must not be intended for purely scientific use. Scientists must process this data and pass it on to the relevant political decision-making authorities. It is, however, crucial for the data collection method to be carried out in a scientifically justified manner. Amendment No 2 amends the initial Commission proposal. What the Commission proposal suggests is drawing up extremely detailed studies of individual vessels and individual businesses. In addition to the extremely high cost of such a proposal, the cumbersome nature of its management may cause some administrations to use its complexities as a pretext not to provide the information in due time and may give rise to a certain feeling of suspicion among the people working in the sector if they have onerous additional bureaucratic constraints foisted upon them in this way. Regarding the second part of this amendment, it is important that job losses in the industry are counted and identified much more clearly. Let us not forget that in the administration of a common fisheries policy the statistical analysis used must include the social aspect. Amendment No 3 makes it possible to add an important aspect: the collection of environmental data. The value of this can be gauged from the particularly serious effects caused by failing to take data of this type into account, for example, in the case of the decision on the prohibition of drift gillnets, which is totally unjustifiable from the environmental standpoint, since they are one of the most selective types of fishing gear that exist. If this environmental dimension were not incorporated into the management of data, then the Commission would be able unilaterally, just as it pleases, to prohibit the use of any particular type of fishing gear. Amendment No 4 specifies the obligation upon scientists to process all the data and pass it on to the relevant authorities, including national and regional authorities, in order to contribute to the decision-making process. Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal. Effectively, the information requested from the authorities must be reasonable in order to allow an operational overview of fishing activities without compromising essential rights to confidentiality, for example, in fiscal matters, where the Community has no jurisdiction. Amendment No 6 is intended to tighten up the Commission' s participation in the inspection procedure. It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results. Finally, Amendment No 7 requires the Commission to produce a report by the end of the year 2001. In fact, because the reform of the common fisheries policy is scheduled for 2002, it is essential that all the political participants should be given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the information which will form the basis of the Commission proposal. Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000) - (FR) The amendment to the directive as presented by the Commission is an important one since it deals with a specific disease, i.e. infectious salmon anaemia, a contagious viral disease. It is a water-borne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood, faecal matter, mucus, etc. There is no scientific proof of the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through roe. It is, however, recognised that other species such as trout, eels or herring, may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it.	de
"We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date. We have voted against Amendments Nos 25 and 72 which would require the achievement of minimal anthroprogenic pollution in all groundwater. We believe this requirement is unrealistic in view of the very high cost and extremely long timescales involved in restoration to a near pristine standard. The foregoing is the reason for our vote. . (FR) Water is a renewable but limited natural resource and needs to be properly managed. The framework directive on water policy will become the cornerstone of Community policy in this area. It has clear, ambitious objectives. We share them. It sets environmental parameters close to zero. But we feel that it would be wiser not to set unrealistic deadlines which neither our governments nor our industries will be able to meet. We need a timetable, by all means, but a more gradual timetable. The legal obligation to achieve a zero input situation, i.e. to stop discharges within 20 years, would in fact mean a ban on all identified substances. Such provisions may well cause serious problems in cross-border areas and in candidate countries, thereby complicating enlargement. I should like, naturally, to refer to a specific sector to which I am very closely attached, i.e. agriculture, the main water-consuming sector. Agriculture must accept its share of 'polluter pays' charges, and has in fact already started to do so, but account must also be taken of its special characteristics and constraints, especially in arid regions. As regards the amendments concerning radioactive substances, I am of course in favour of controls, but the question arises of the legal basis, which comes under the Euratom Treaty. Andersson report (A5-0033/2000) The Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities has not been able to vote in favour of the Andersson report. This does, of course, contain a number of good observations. For example, it is acknowledged on page 15 of the explanatory statement that ""the different levels of development and traditions in the field of social security in the Member States make it impossible to bring about uniform harmonisation of the Member States' social security systems"" . Now, the concept of ""uniform harmonisation"" is one of those muddled expressions which totally obfuscates the integration process in question. It is also true, as it states in the explanatory statement, that harmonisation could be damaging as ""it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time as competitive considerations might exert pressure on more socially developed countries to cut back on social security. No-one would benefit from this type of harmonisation"" . The situation, however, is that a social model is being established whose real purpose is harmonisation, and uniform harmonisation into the bargain. Paragraph D points out that ""the Union may provide added value by adoption of proper binding and effective convergence criteria"" , and the report goes on to emphasise that the development of this convergence process is to be promoted by means of joint talks between the Ecofin Council and the Social Affairs and Employment Councils. Finally, paragraph 7 emphasises that ""the social convergence process must be accompanied by an effective and ambitious fiscal coordination"" . And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter. This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy."	de
(The sitting was suspended at 11.50 a.m. for a formal sitting on the occasion of an address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic and resumed at 12.50 p.m.) VOTE (continuation) We shall now continue with the vote on the Stenzel report on the EQUAL initiative (A5-0034/2000). (Parliament adopted the resolution) Recommendation for second reading: (A5-0027/2000) by Ms Lienemann, on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy, on the common position adopted by the Council with a view to the adoption of a European Parliament and Council directive on establishing a framework for Community action in the field of water policy (9085/3/1999 - C5-0209/1999 - 1997/0067(COD)) Before the vote: . (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE. I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council. As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following: LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment; Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients; The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere; The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation. I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries. The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million. I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance. The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement. If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme. This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions!	de
So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success. It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures. Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States. Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement. What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this. For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States. After five years only four have done so. This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office. There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity. We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised. The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process. We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals. In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established. I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment. The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings. The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF. The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency. The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities. There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States. The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts. In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared.	fr
These disasters are in fact the result of extreme climatic changes with which we should be quite familiar, since they are precipitated by human activities, notably those of developed countries. The greenhouse effect and deforestation also have a considerable impact. As regards this regulation on the environmental dimension in the development process in developing countries, the Council has broadly taken up the amendments that we presented and voted upon at first reading. From this perspective we cannot fail to be satisfied. I would nevertheless like to stress one point that the Council has overlooked - inadvertently, I believe and hope - but which is absolutely fundamental: coordination between European operators and local partners, which is to say local NGOs, grass-roots communities and people with a time-honoured understanding of how to harness biological diversity. No programme can be truly effective unless it is conducted in close collaboration with the communities concerned. One last point: should we be successful in setting up steering committees, I believe it would be necessary to re-emphasise the importance of establishing a complaint procedure which is open to civil society in developing countries with regard to measures that run counter to legitimate concerns in the field of social welfare. Mr President, the key to the development of the less developed countries is that they should have the chance themselves to participate in their own development programmes by identifying the problems themselves and seeking solutions to them. Whenever I have been involved in development work I have observed that this approach has, thankfully, over the past few years been taking the place of the old paternalistic aid-oriented ideology, where the so-called developed countries thought development was a matter of transferring our way of life to the less developed countries. The new paradigm for development cooperation stresses the notion of partnership, in which the so-called donor of aid is a consulting party. It must allow scope for the countries concerned to determine for themselves what their problems are, and let them draw up a plan to improve the situation and find a solution themselves. The most important task aid agencies have is to make themselves unnecessary, all the while ensuring that the work is leading to local action and prosperity. My colleague, Mr Wijkman, has produced a good report in this respect, one that emphasises this paradigm that is the only successful and morally tenable one. However, at present, this approach is being applied scandalously badly by the EU as far as scientific and technological projects are concerned. The EU' s framework programmes do not extend to developing countries. In other words, our North African partners, for example, cannot become involved in scientific and technological projects concerning the environment. Nothing is actually preventing them from doing research but there are simply no facilities for financing projects, as the developing countries do not have access to the consortia as a party applying for funds. But why not? It has been made easier for Eastern Europe to participate. The matter is even harder to appreciate, when we think of how much we are affected by the problems of desertification in North Africa and the problems that are associated with the Mediterranean area.	it
Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular. This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances. In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions. Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules. It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts. This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities. Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies. Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed. We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world. The principle of competition must now be universal in its application. We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery. Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors. First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly. Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group. For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this. Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources. The form the aid takes is important. Forms of state aid that require an effort from the beneficiary are to be supported. For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies. The report on competition policy further stresses the Commission' s confidence in hard and fast rules instead of putting the emphasis on economic arguments regarding efficiency, which affects competitiveness.	fr
"I believe there are circumstances when the question of principles and institutional regulations is obliterated. I urge the Council and the Council Presidency to continue to protect the fundamental values of the Union. I urge the Commission to be less cautious. In this resolution, Parliament is assuming its responsibilities. Having said that, in my opinion, the resolution adopted today is the absolute minimum, the very least we could do. Personally I argued in favour of a rather harder line, and I supported Amendments Nos 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral amendment tabled by the Socialist Group. In fact I consider it essential for the Council to accept only purely technical relations with the representatives of an Austrian Government which includes members of the Austrian Freedom Party. Including Jörg Haider' s party in a coalition government makes the presence of the extreme right an everyday fact of life in Europe, and sets an extremely dangerous precedent which may generate a serious aftermath in other Union Member States or in candidate countries. The Austrian People' s Party must accept some historical responsibility for this. It is our fundamental values which are at stake here. As the democratically elected representatives of the European people, we have no choice. We must reject what is unacceptable, as our constituents demand. Because, when the spectre of barbarism resurfaces, failure to oppose is tantamount to capitulation. I abstained in the vote on adopting the resolution. I condemn Jörg Haider' s racist and xenophobic policy. However, I cannot accept that an EU body should intervene politically in the internal policy of one Member State. I cannot therefore accept paragraph 4 in the joint resolution, and I cannot vote in favour of the resolution, even though it would be a vote against the extreme right. - (SV) Obviously, the political leaders of Europe have a right and a duty to react against Mr Haider and his party. The political leaders of Europe are entitled to express their view of political developments in another Member State, just as a prime minister can express his opinion about racist politicians in a local authority. Finland' s experience, however, is that integration, rather than isolation, is the better way of combating antidemocratic forces. I therefore voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution, which presupposes that all parties have respect for human rights. The EU Presidency' s ""common reaction"" against the formation of the government in Austria is legally unjustified. The treaties do not authorise this reaction by the 14 Member States. Nor should we isolate the forces in Austria which wish to work for human rights. Despite these objections of mine to the Council' s action and despite my view that it is better to work for integration than to employ isolating tactics, it was important to show clearly where the European Parliament stands on questions of racism, which is why I voted in favour of the resolution at the final vote. That concludes the vote. Adjournment of the session"	fr
Of course, if consensus could be reached on this issue at the Intergovernmental Conference, there might eventually be progress. It remains to be seen whether or not there is a consensus on this. We will soon see, and for our part, we will bear in mind any suggestions on this issue. Mr President, I join others in wishing Portugal every good wish for a successful presidency. I notice that you said this particular issue was not currently on your agenda for the next IGC but if some people wished it, you would consider it. Well, I, and my fellow 35 British Conservative MEPs wish it and would like you to please consider it. I appreciate that it is a provocative question. It is meant to provoke because there is a very serious issue here that some countries do not hold EU law in the respect which it deserves. We have to find some way of putting pressure on such countries to do just that so we can reconnect with our citizens. I cannot think of a better way to do it. Can you? The issue is whether the European dimension will become stronger or weaker as a result of being specifically integrated into the Treaties. This is an issue which, as you will understand, will have to be addressed at IGC level and is an issue that only a Special European Council can authorise the Portuguese Presidency to pursue, because this kind of issue falls outside the institutional framework in which the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will take place. Intergovernmental Conferences are a kind of event in themselves and could also be a type of Christmas tree. It is therefore not out of the question that these issues, which crop up again and again, and which are passed from one conference to another, may be addressed. The problem facing us at the moment is whether there is currently a consensus within the European Union on this issue being included, particularly bearing in mind that if one such issue is included, other issues of a similar nature will probably be added to the conference' s agenda. Mr Dimitrakopoulos has the floor for a procedural motion. I would ask him to be brief. Mr President, I understand that I have to do this very quickly. I liked what Mr Seixas da Costa said about Father Christmas. In Spain they say a letter to the three kings. I simply wish to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent a letter to the three kings through its reports. Now the Presidency and the Council have to bring the presents which we have asked them for in our letter to the three kings. As I suspected, it was not exactly a procedural motion, but more a closing of the debate. We thank Mr Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the three kings. I would merely say that the festive issue which Mr Dimitrakopoulos has raised is an extremely important one. The problem is that in this case Father Christmas has to follow orders and therefore he can only give presents when he is authorised by others to do so.	de
There is still much to be done, however. The next great challenge is to re-launch the new round of world trade negotiations that failed to take off last December in Seattle. It must be a 'development round' , in which developing countries, effectively excluded from previous rounds, are fully included. For the best way to reduce world poverty is to help developing countries help themselves. Developing countries want trade not aid, a help up not a hand-out. And the best way to help developing countries help themselves is to open up world markets to allow them to sell their products. In this way, the power of globalisation can be harnessed for the good, to benefit the poor not just the wealthy, the many not just the few. Thus, whether through the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in Freetown, Labour' s aim of opportunity for all remains the same. Swoboda report (A5-0031/2000) . (FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War. Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s. And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community. In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case. Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements. Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement. The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion. The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone.	es
"In my capacity as a representative of the Commission, I will ensure that the charter and the actions stemming from it represent an affirmation of a Union based on a set of fundamental rights which are an integral part of Europe' s common heritage. That is the only way in which we can help to restore the legitimacy of the project of an enlarged European Union in the eyes of every European citizen, an enlarged Europe based on respect for rights and freedoms, with a guarantee of personal safety and safety of property and with effective legal protection, in other words, a Union rooted in the political values which underpin contemporary democracies. I must not overlook the fact that 1999 marked the beginning of the 1999-2004 parliamentary term of the European Parliament, that it was the year in which the new Commission took up its duties and, as a consequence, the year in which a Commissioner solely responsible for the areas of justice and home affairs assumed his responsibilities. In addition to these events, I would like to remind Parliament of some items that were approved in 1999. In the field of immigration, borders and asylum, the Commission presented a proposal for a regulation on setting up the Eurodac database, and a proposal for a directive on conditions for admitting third country nationals into Member States of the European Union with a view to reuniting families, as part of a vigorous policy of integrating legal residents in the territory of the European Union. We also presented a communication on common procedures concerning asylum and a recommendation for a decision authorising the Commission to open negotiations with Iceland and Norway on an agreement designed to extend the rules applied by the Member States of the European Union under the Dublin Convention to those two countries. The Commission made an active contribution to the work of the High Level Group on Asylum and Migration, and ultimately, in December, it presented a proposal aimed at establishing a European refugee fund. In the field of judicial cooperation, the Commission presented proposals for regulations aimed at the ""communitisation"" of certain conventions. These were the convention on judicial cooperation and the enforcement of judgements in civil and commercial matters (Brussels I), the convention on jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement of judgements in matrimonial matters (Brussels II), and a third convention concerning the service of judicial and extrajudicial documents in civil or commercial matters. In 1999, we also presented a communication on victims of crime in the European Union, which led to discussions that were given greater impetus at Tampere. This communication called for minimum standards for protecting the victims of crime, in particular as regards their access to justice and their rights to compensation, including the cost of justice. We also presented a proposal for a decision on combating fraud and forgery of non-cash means of payment. In the field of European Union legislation on combating financial crime, the Commission presented a proposal for an amended directive on money laundering. In 1999, Europol took up its duties and we in the Commission, echoing the Portuguese Presidency' s statement today, sincerely hope that as we enter a new era in justice and home affairs and discussions start on the implementation of new powers attributed to Europol under the Treaty of Amsterdam, there will also be a discussion of democratic control and of the links between Europol and the relevant judicial institutions, and in particular Eurojust."	it
These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services. The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises. The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts. Why do I think we need the directive so much? Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market. Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible. My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations? How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries? Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them. Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided. There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory. I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low. So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation. The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card. It seems important, in this respect, to underline that the service provision card will be issued in a flexible manner, namely within five days of a simple declaration' s having been submitted to a Member State where the service will be provided; and that, also to prevent misuse, this document will have a restricted period of validity which will not be automatically extended. I have also paid close attention to the concerns raised by the Commissioner. Having also studied the amendments submitted, I concluded that we can go along with these concerns to a large extent and that this will be reflected in our voting behaviour tomorrow. May I, to finish off, thank Mrs Berger for the great care she has taken in studying the different amendments and for having, in that way, added an important degree of meaning to her report?	fr
We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010. We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development. I would lastly like to refer to the amendments on dangerous substances which establish that we must achieve a zero, or close to zero, degree of pollution. In no field of human activity have we ever discovered a zero degree of pollution. We will be doing a general disservice to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee compliance with its provisions. I hope that, once again, this House will vote with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking a suitable balance between the environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements in achieving the sustainable development which we all wish to see so much. Mr President, Commissioner, this is a very important directive. Its aim is to improve the quality of water and the reliability of the water supply and sewage systems. The public must have a right to clean water. It is important not only for the environment but also for public health. I am not speaking so much for myself, as I happen to be one of those few lucky people in Europe who can drink water directly from their own lake at home. We must make sure that we get started quickly with the programme to improve water quality. Action must get under way immediately. We cannot afford to waste time. It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one. In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then. It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious. I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier. I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water. This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive. Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work. Water and air surround us everywhere. We share them with everyone on this earth. Water is a prerequisite for human life. And there are more and more of us in the world. Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal. Nothing could be further from the truth! It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life.	it
Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions. At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue. Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts. But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord. Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example. But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation. Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible. However, since state aid forms the lion' s share of the competition report 1998 I would still like, regardless of Mr Jonckheer' s report, to say one more thing about it. It is certainly possible, indeed it must be feasible for state aid to be given to small and medium-sized enterprises involved in research and development for the purpose of educating them in regional and environmental policy. Indeed it must be permissible for state aid to be provided for such purposes, provided it does not lead to unacceptable distortion of competition. This is precisely the area where it is even more important than it is in monopolies and mergers law for decisions to be comprehensible. It is not just that we should pillory state aid; rather our approach must be one of drawing distinctions and we must assess the different types of state aid in accordance with the extent to which they help to achieve the above-mentioned objectives. My last comment was intended not so much for the Commission as for the Members of the Group of the European People' s Party. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report which I have the opportunity to propose to you today is an opinion on the Commission' s Annual Report on the state aid in force within the European Union and for which the Community is authorised under Articles 87, 88 and 89 of the Treaties. The Commission report is essentially a descriptive report detailing the development of state aid in the manufacturing sector and certain other sectors, according to various typologies, such as the method of financing and the objectives pursued. Let me refer you to the explanatory statement for the quantitative aspects of the report and simply mention at this point that the annual level of state aid, on average, for the period under review, is in the order of EUR 95 billion, corresponding to a reduction in the order of 13 % in relation to the period 1993-1995, a reduction which is essentially due to a reduction in aid in the Federal Republic of Germany. To put it plainly, the level of state aid declared, roughly speaking, is generally stable during the period under discussion and comes to approximately 1.2% of Community GDP or more or less the equivalent, coincidentally, of the Community budget for one year.	fr
"What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making? What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made. When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word ""qualifications"" also crops up. What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined. It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications. Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence. This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers. Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday. In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the ""Women' s World Marches"" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day. This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world. Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother. We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found. Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness. Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics. It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible. In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors. The vast majority of them are not members of any party. In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories. In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected. But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates. Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union. That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities. The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system. On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses. The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women. With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions. It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation. The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs. On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women."	de
In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term. This is the price of the future of generations to come. Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE. I shall therefore reiterate that, as the rapporteur has already said quite clearly, LIFE is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation of the European Union' s policy on the environment. This instrument is absolutely essential since it provides the impetus for truly innovative actions in favour of nature and the environment in Europe, which are adopted and expanded upon by the Member States. This financial instrument is, furthermore, deliberately democratic since it is accessible to both governmental and non-governmental organisations. That is why, ladies and gentlemen, I would urge you not to vote in favour of the amendments which have no appreciation of the spirit of LIFE. Through the associations, then, LIFE is a facility that can be used by the European citizen directly, and for the benefit of actions in the interest of the community. Several million NGO members - millions, I say - recognise in LIFE the Union' s determination to build up an ambitious policy in favour of our natural heritage. LIFE is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe into which the Member States have put a lot, pursuant to Community directives on the habitats of rare and endangered fauna and flora and on migratory birds, and which makes it possible to set up the protection of sites of high biological value in our States. I should like to say that those who run down this policy in their own States bear the responsibility for obstructing European nature conservation policies. This is a pity because everyone within this Chamber knows that LIFE is a financial instrument which is not sufficient to carry out the projects submitted by Member States, a good many of which are turned down due to lack of funds. Let us not forget that, to date, LIFE amounts to only EUR 100 million per annum, i.e. scarcely 0.1% of the budget of the European Union. For the record, the budget for agriculture, which has a real impact on the environment, amounts, as we all know, to EUR 37 billion. Against this background, my group thinks it essential to increase the allocation to LIFE and unreservedly supports Mrs Lienemann' s proposal to increase the budget to EUR 850 million, since we know, and I think it bears saying, how high the expectations of our fellow citizens on environmental matters are and how excessively cautious and unacceptable the Council' s compromise regarding the budget for LIFE is, especially as the LIFE programmes show exceptional implementation rates and have demonstrated the extent to which they made it possible to bring about new environmental practice. The first sustainable development projects are unquestionably those. Mr President, the European Union environmental programme, to which a considerable amount (EUR 613 million) has been allocated, gives rise to many questions regarding the proper use of public funds. A financial instrument of this order ought to be transparent and effective, and this is not the case for the following reasons: poorly defined selection criteria, dubious uncoordinated operations, assessments not made public and the lack of any assessment policy.	de
In order to facilitate achieving this objective, Directive 96/35/EC provided for the appointment of safety advisers for dangerous goods who would have appropriate professional training. This professional training would be targeted at awareness of the terms of the legislation, regulations and administrative conditions applicable to such transport. While this represented significant progress at the time, the lack of specific terms governing the harmonisation of examination requirements proved to be a problem. It therefore seemed essential to make good this omission in order to achieve the standardised, high-level training of safety advisers, but also in order to avoid any disparities between the costs of training, with a concomitant effect on competition between the firms of different Member Sates. The Commission proposal seeks to ensure that the training of safety advisers is standardised. It outlines the minimum content of examinations and defines the role of the authorising body as well as the requirements demanded of the examining bodies. Parliament voted in favour of this text. It did, however, table a number of amendments, most of which were adopted in the Council' s common position, particularly regarding the need to draw up a questionnaire and statements on the authorisation of some document in the context of the 'specification of the examination arrangements proposed by the examination body' . In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force. I shall conclude by emphasising that harmonising the professional qualifications of advisers will contribute to improving the quality of the service in the interest of users, to minimising the risks of accident likely to cause damage to the environment as well as significant damage liable to be harmful to any person who may come into contact with dangerous goods. Koch Report (A5-0104/1999) Last October I expressed my views on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by rail. The views I shall express today are not far removed from those I had then. Essentially, my opinion is as follows: I deplore the fact that, in a field as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we keep putting off the adoption of harmonised standards to the detriment of human beings and the environment. I shall point out that a directive on the approximation of Member State legislation on the transport of dangerous goods by road came into force on 1 January 1997. This included a number of interim conditions valid until 1 January 1999. This is the time when we should have expressed our opinion of the Commission proposal to put an end to the derogations. In line with the usual procedure, it is the European Committee for Standardisation (CEN) which puts forward standards in this area, and they are then integrated in to the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road signed in Geneva in 1957 (known generally as ADR), applicable throughout Europe, whose terms and conditions form the basis for the legislation applicable within the EU. The CEN has been unable to complete its work in the time allotted.	it
I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy? The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities. That would seem odd to me. Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door. Will they also take part in our defence policy? It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least. High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force. However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further. I believe that we will have to reach a compromise in this area between those who, rightly, are pushing for the communitisation of this policy and those who think that such advances should be the responsibility of the Intergovernmental Conference. A word of warning to the latter: this policy needs substantial democratic legitimisation. We are aware of the importance of public opinion when we intervene in matters of foreign and security policy, and I would therefore ask you, in general terms, of course, whether you feel that the reform could tackle any of the following issues: the new, two-level Commission-High Representative structure; a clear, practical distinction between civilian and military crisis management. At this stage, this could include, for example, collaboration between the Commission and the Political Committee, the consolidation of Community responsibility for non-military crisis management, the creation of a Council of Ministers for Defence, coordination of the Treaty on European Union, the NATO Charter and the WEU, the legal personality of the European Union, reinforced cooperation in this area as well, parliamentary control and, lastly, financing. Do you think that any of these issues could be included, at least in the agenda of the current Conference? Mr Solana, I am sitting quite close to you, close enough to see your face. I think that you have aged, your face is quite lined. It pains me to look at you and I despair on listening to you; that applies both to what you say about games with little soldiers, as Mrs Maes just put it, and what you do not say. You bear a huge responsibility because the pretext of ethnic cleansing is being used to spill blood in another bout of ethnic cleansing in Kosovo and yet you have stood up here, while blood is being spilled in Kosovo, and you have not said a word about it. You are Spanish; you are from a large country, Mr Solana. Spain and Franco were not one and the same. Spain maintained its unity, it kept the Basque country and Andalucia and Catalonia and it did well to do so, because no one identified Spain with Franco and no one played around with Spain' s unity in the name of a Fascist dictator. Today, you are identifying Yugoslavia with Milosevic and you are playing with Voivodina, with Montenegro and with southern Serbia. It is you who has created this mess.	de
I was even more surprised to read that the French authorities had wind of this days before but did not warn the volunteers to take protective measures. I would like to know from the Commissioner whether and, if so, when the European Commission was informed of the possible threat to public health. We must learn from past experiences. Shipping disasters such as that involving the Erika could well strike again off the Dutch, English, Spanish or Belgian coasts. The regulations which we are drawing up today in Europe should be regarded as a precedent. We should therefore be strict with the polluters and generous to the victims. Mr President, echoing the thoughts of a number of Members, I should like to tell you that, two and a half months after the wreck, the situation remains particularly critical and every day the scale of the disaster becomes even more apparent. There are two aspects, the first being the environmental angle. The wreck still contains 16 000 tonnes of heavy gas oil which is leaking and, in addition to these leaks, unfortunately, last week we observed and counted 35 acts of ecological piracy, 35 degassing operations, disgracefully aggravating this already catastrophic situation. Mrs de Palacio expressed her views at length regarding this issue and I feel she set to work without waiting for an element which today is absolutely essential, a draft European maritime law, following a draft directive on the maritime transportation of dangerous goods. From this point of view, this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety. The secondary impact, however, is proving to be on the economy, the primary impact being environmental and only the second economic, as many Members have stated. Shellfish farming, fishing, oyster farming and fish farming are today seriously affected, for the effects of the oil slick have been compounded by the storm damage affecting many areas. Unfortunately, these sectors have been devastated: they have first to rebuild and then, perhaps the most difficult thing, to regain consumer confidence. Confronted with this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, the Vendée and Charente, as well as the forestry workers in other regions, await a signal from the European Union. We cannot claim that rapprochement with the citizens is the touchstone of this legislative period if, at the same time, we hold our tongues and do not offer practical responses in the face of phenomena of this magnitude. I took very careful note of Commissioner Fischler' s remarks, perhaps the most practical suggestions we have heard to date. There have been many declarations of sympathy and solidarity, and many announcements, admittedly, but now it is time for expectations to be met with a tangible display of European solidarity. The Erika oil spill is one of a catalogue of disasters that have taken place in recent years in Community waters, including the Braer spill off Shetland and the Sea Empress off Wales. These spills, in addition to causing irreparable ecological damage, have devastated local industries.	es
These proposals favour women especially. Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable. We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme. Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping. The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement. We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee. We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report. Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen. This indicates that we have a broad consensus. A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject. I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report. On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. I think this proposal is a good one. Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better. Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade. The EU is also a union for employment and social justice. In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play. By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society. We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy. The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion. In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into. I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report. The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection. Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection. Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals.	es
The first legal challenge followed the start of work on the port of development in early autumn 1999 without the compensatory habitat improvements being in place. As a result, the Irish authorities agreed to reinstate the cord grass removal but this time by direct mechanical means. The use of mechanical means led to a further legal challenge - that is what I referred to also in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical removal would damage the underlying mudflats and would cause the ecologically-harmful spread of cord grass in the estuary. There is to date no conclusive outcome to this legal challenge. The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is a matter for the national authorities, and does not require prior Commission approval. The Commission' s role is to make sure that the standards required by the Birds Directive are fully met, and clearly there would be a problem with compensatory measures which were themselves damaging. In this case, the Commission proposes to seek further clarification from the Irish authorities on the up-to-date position on the compensatory measures and possible problems with the mechanical removal of cord grass. We are not at the moment ready to propose to stop the financing from the Structural Funds. Mr President, sadly, the specific case raised by Mrs McKenna is not an isolated one. There are other examples of conservation in special scientific areas being damaged as a result of EU funding. Will the Commission consider issuing instructions to all Member States saying that, if in future it discovers that European environmental directives have been breached or proper environmental assessment has not been carried out, it will not only stop future funding but will withdraw the funding already granted, in other words, reclaim the money from the Member States? It is only such action which will discourage this practice in the future. . (SV) This is a very important question. As MEPs are well aware, in the course of last year a joint text was issued by our predecessors in the Commission, Ritt Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies concerning the relationship between the Structural Funds, money from the Structural Funds and protection under the Habitats and Birds Directives. The message contained in the joint text is still valid. We cannot hand out money with one hand and, with the other, take countries to court, where they may well be fined. It is therefore important that there be a coordination strategy. The result may, of course, be some difficult questions of priorities. In my view, the most important consequence, however, is that countries should do some careful thinking and, above all, make sure they send in their lists of Natura 2000 sites. Then we will be in a position to carry out methodical monitoring and follow-up procedures. In that respect, Ireland falls short, like other Member States, but we hope that the pressure we are exerting will produce results. I should just like to point out once again that the joint text still holds good.	es
I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too. We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter. Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way. The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements. The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years. By then, my children will be older than I am now. You have to admit: this is a joke. Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children. Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment. I would like to finish off with this observation. In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium. What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers. In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations. They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning. I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware. Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient. We need to change tack completely. During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy. This can only benefit our credibility. The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m. The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform. This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction. This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions. Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully. Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do. We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us.	it
In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources. The second point is human resources. It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource. They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used. This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work. However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low. Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism. All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform. Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility. These are the areas in which changes will be made. The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management. This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security. We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General. At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system. This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations. This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking. We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place. In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world. We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology. We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration. The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission. This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission. This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well. I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise.	it
Firstly, and this is perhaps the basic point of the proposal, the idea, which goes hand in hand with recycling and the use of waste, that we should use materials which will subsequently cause less pollution. Another point is that waste should not be incinerated or crushed, not only in the case of lead, cadmium and mercury, but also in the case of waste which contains PVC. Parliament is currently discussing this issue in another context. The other question is who should bear the cost. I agree with previous speakers who have said that the polluter should pay, and this proposal expresses that idea very well. Producers must pay - although we all know that the consumer will ultimately suffer the consequences of this - and they must take responsibility for the costs before 2006, as some of the amendments propose. We are more in agreement with the amendment proposed at first reading. It is also important to set percentages and a date for vehicles to be composed of recyclable materials. I believe that this proposal relies on very long deadlines. Lastly, Mr President, I believe we should favour the creation of small and medium-sized businesses which, if subject to rigorous approval and duly authorised, can promote the creation of jobs in this very important area, preventing the emergence of monopolies by large companies. Mr President, today the European Parliament must face up to real responsibilities. We have to work out what we are going to do with the millions of vehicles we abandon each year. In some of our Member States, voluntary environmental agreements have already been signed to ensure that our ditches, canals and fields are not filled with these ugly and dangerous wrecks, inhabited occasionally by an alarmed farmyard chicken. I come, of course, from a country that is proud of its car industry and of its commercial success both in Europe and in third countries. I can gauge its importance for my country' s international reputation. I know of the proactive attitude of the European car manufacturing industry which has set up an extensive research programme to outline a national information system for dismantling end-of-life vehicles. I am aware of the difficulties the Council experienced in finding a compromise. That is why, today, we must be understanding alchemists, concerned for our environment. This will either be the century of waste management or it will not. As far as I am concerned, at least, the principle of 'polluter pays' must be applied. The car industry, increasingly more respectful of the environment, has, I am sure, anticipated this kind of increasing awareness. Indeed it is accepting its responsibilities. It is the Member States, however, who will have to implement this directive, and let us beware of going into too much detail because the industrial traditions, the demolition and crushing sectors vary according to whether you are in Italy or in Finland. I am opposed to making the car owners liable. The men and women on the move throughout Europe pay for their car and their catalytic converter, pay their national taxes and the tax on fuel and are therefore already paying a high price for their magnificent machine and their freedom of movement.	it
Our general policy however, is to recognise the inherent dignity and the unique contribution of indigenous people to the development and plurality of society, something we are looking at particularly keenly in the context of the northern dimension which we are trying to develop and which we are discussing with North America. The Commission shares the growing concern about the missing Russian journalist, Mr Babitsky and the conditions for the independent media in Chechnya more generally. This issue comes on top of our deep worries about the plight of the civilian population in Chechnya, and I have heard Mr Posselt on this subject before. There are alarming reports of human rights violations. Of course, there has been disproportionate use of force in the present conflict. The Commission delegation in Moscow participated in a European Union Troika démarche on the eleventh of this month. We underlined our serious concerns about freedom of the press and freedom of speech and we pressed the Russians to clarify the circumstances of Mr Babitsky' s detention in view of their obligations in the field of human rights. We await a proper response from the Russians. In the meantime, the conclusions of the General Affairs Council earlier this week have confirmed the message which I have given today. And we are ready to return to the issue at the EU-Russia Ministerial Troika in Lisbon on 2 March, if we need to do so. Finally, on Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge: we strongly agree that senior Khmer Rouge leaders should be accountable for their crimes. I totally agree with the arguments that were put forward by Mr Morillon. We vigorously supported the Troika démarche to Foreign Minister Hor Namhong on 4 February this year. The European Union underlined its full support for the efforts of the United Nations on the need for a tribunal to prosecute former Khmer Rouge leaders. At the same time, we welcome the continued dialogue between the two parties. I am encouraged by the optimism of Kofi Annan, Secretary-General of the UN, on the chances of agreement on the proposed tribunal. The Commission will continue to raise issues regarding the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights with Cambodian authorities through the EC-Cambodia Cooperation Agreement which entered into force on 1 November last year. It has been useful to debate human rights twice in a couple of days. I hope we have other opportunities, but I hope we will have fewer examples of their abuse in the years ahead. Thank you very much Commissioner Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 6.00 p.m. Danube environmental disaster The next item is the joint debate on the following motions for resolutions: B5-0164/2000 by Mr Leinen on behalf of the Group of the Party of European Socialists, B5-0167/2000 by Mr Maaten and Mrs Thors on behalf of the Group of the European Democrat and Reform Party, B5-0168/2000 by Mr Oostlander and Mrs Grossetête on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats,	fr
An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it. We have been asked for EUR 35 million. We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible. We are talking about macrofinancial aid. There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration. This is not our opinion. Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region. Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state. The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying. The other parties are not paying. We wish to see an end to this one-sided situation regarding requests for financial aid. We would like the Commission to make commitments on the amendments we are proposing in regard to this. We would like to link the granting of all aid to the availability of the amounts due from the other donors. This is not in order to limit or be stingy with our financial contribution to Kosovo but, quite the contrary, to ensure that our contribution is being matched by the contributions of other donors. From that point of view, the proposed facility is a two-phase aid facility and the second tranche must be released as soon as the donors have made clear their interest. Finally, we have three questions for the Commission in this regard. Firstly, we need the Commission to give us, on a regular basis, the list and the amounts that other donors contribute. When we come to pay, we want to know what the others are paying. Secondly, we wish to see an exact progress report on the invitations to tender and the schedule for their implementation. During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date. This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo. Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made. We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments. It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid. Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment. Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all.	es
In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this. When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you. So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future. I am especially grateful for all of this. We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament. In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction. Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration. As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy. I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past. Thank you, Commissioner Monti. The joint debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests. Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud. For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget. Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening. Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring. The Union can only impose sanctions in the field pertaining to administrative law when cases are exposed. So far, efforts on the part of the Commission to ask for improperly obtained money to be returned only had limited success. It is for the Member States to undertake criminal measures. Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States.	it
And a woman was elected. The second event took place in France, which passed a law on the equal representation of men and women as a result of the declaration made in April 1999 at the 'Women and Men in Power' conference, at which the ministers responsible undertook to implement specific measures and policies to change the power ratio. We must congratulate Prime Minister Jospin for ratifying this commitment in the clearest and most categorical manner. A great deal has been said and numerous policies have been implemented in the Member States. But the figures tell the true story. And the figures still give Europe cause for concern. 24% of members of government are women and there are an average of 22% in parliament, although this fluctuates from 6% in some Member States to as many as 40% in others. The number of women on committees who wield power and frame policies is very small. Even in countries such as Germany and Belgium, which have specific legal commitments on the representation of the two sexes, the involvement of women on various committees is no more than 18%. What we need, therefore, is to promote specific policies. We need a policy mix which includes long-term political commitments, as in Sweden and Finland; they now have governments in which women account for 56% and 44% of members respectively. We need organisation and statistical monitoring. We need controls and suitable structures which reflect the culture, mentality and specific problems of each area. And, of course, these policies need a budget, they need to be given financial teeth. Increasing the number of women or, as the French prime minister put it, increasing the influence of women in the decision-making centres, is the best way of renewing the policy, of reshaping the approach to the question, of injecting political thought with new ideas and new experience: the new ideas and experience which women can inject by reason of the different way in which they live and grow up. The recent initiative by the Finnish presidency to develop indicators recording and reflecting the representation of women in the decision-making centres is extremely important. These indicators include national parliaments, regional councils and town councils and give a complete picture of the degree of representation of women in every Member State. I think that creating and supporting statistics is a very important political issue and that the facility to set targets, compare performances and bolster our efforts is an important political tool. The programme which I shall present for the fifth women' s programme includes a similar initiative for systematic monitoring. Although legislative measures and institutional intervention by Member States have been effective as far as the decision-making centres of the parties in power is concerned, the same cannot be said for the private sector. My contacts with large European and multinational companies in Europe have brought tragic results to light. There are companies at European level which employ thousands of workers, sometimes hundreds of thousands of workers throughout the world and yet fewer than 2% of the directors and managers are women.	fr
I very much fear that we are to have yet another authority that flies through Europe anonymously like a satellite; an authority of this kind would be anathema to me and I hope it does not come to that. I also welcome the White Paper. But do you envisage that the Food Safety Agency will have enough teeth to prevent something like the beef war that we have had and France's refusal to lift the ban? You mentioned the Commission being able to withhold grants and subsidies from countries who are acting in the way that France is acting. Would you also propose that the Commission could give interim payments for instance, similar to the one that the British farmers are asking for at the moment? Mr President, you said during last week' s information session that it was your view that any future EU food agency should not be located on the periphery, but you did not mention what that periphery was. For example, the work of the EU unit located in Dublin has shown that physical distance is no barrier these days to communication and having an effective influence on matters. It has been suggested that the most important tasks of a future food authority will be to gather, publish and coordinate data, make recommendations for improved food safety, and - as you said - collect scientific data and popularise that information for consumers. All this will be managed with the help of modern technology in any area of the European Union. I would ask you on what you base your ideas for a location? In relation to the makeup of the authority: first of all it will employ in-house scientists who will liaise with and consult with scientists who are experts in the particular field that is being considered at any particular time. In addition to that, the food safety authority will have a board. You will notice in the White Paper that we have not been specific about the makeup of that board. This is an issue which I expect will be discussed between Parliament and the Commission over the next few weeks and months. I envisage that the board's membership will be made up from stakeholders or representatives of stakeholders. Its function will have to be set out in detail in the proposal I will bring to the Commission in September. We have not done that yet but it will be done in September. I do not expect that the board will have any function in directing the scientists how to do their work. That would erode the independence of the scientific advice. But it would have an overall remit, particularly, for instance, in requesting the authority to investigate particular areas requiring research. Mr Florenz asks whether Parliament will have a say in that. That is an issue for consideration and discussion. There may be a number of views on that. Some may take the view that it would be inappropriate for Parliament or Members of Parliament - or indeed Parliament nominees - to be members of the board.	fr
"We are aware that this directive is founded on EC law and not on EU law. However, before the elections we - the Council, the Commission, Parliament, the press, unions and companies that is - worked towards making the Europe we have today more comprehensible to the citizens. We have expected the citizens to take on board the transition from EEC to EC to EU. They have now got to grips with ""EU"" . We would be doing neither ourselves nor the citizens any favours if we were to christen the product we are proposing to deliver ""EC service provision card"" and not ""EU service provision card"" . It is the world of the EU that the citizens are interested in, this is the one that counts in their eyes. I would urge the Council and the Commission to move in this direction. Mr President it is later than any of us thought it would be when we were planning for this session so I shall be very brief indeed. One of the reasons why we are late is because we spent time earlier today rightly stating the rooted opposition of this Parliament to any form of xenophobia or racism. This directive is, of course, not in itself directly about that. It is about attending to the needs of the internal market, creating flexibility and behaving in a reasonable and flexible way to enable the employment of third country persons both as employees and self-employed. That is in itself also about avoiding being unduly restrictive towards the stranger simply because he or she is a stranger. We welcome that, and because we think it makes a sensible and proper provision, we will support the most liberal version which we understand to be consistent with the law. Mr President, Commissioner, I would firstly like to highlight the excellent work carried out by Mrs Berger and the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market generally, which has incorporated innovative ideas into this directive, which I hope will be approved by the Commission and the Council. Nevertheless, I have tabled an amendment. Mrs Berger, in your Amendment No 2 to Recital 6, you mention legal security. The first point on which we disagree is the duration of three months for the residency permit, since all that does is create legal insecurity. You rightly raise the concern, also expressed by Mr Wieland, at the possibility of workers disappearing into thin air when their work permits expire, but I think that we would be making this even more likely by bringing in a three month permit. If the validity of the service provision card expires on a certain date, it must end on that date. Legal security requires this. On the other hand, with regard to point d of Amendment No 10, which refers to the first directive, you suggest that, for reasons of public security or public order regulations, a Member State may reject the validity of the card. There are already some ex ante controls laid down in article 4 of the directive. It makes no sense for any worker within the Schengen area, since he or she will already have undergone a screening process in order to enter the first Member State, and the second Member State would be justified in rejecting ex ante the entry of that worker into its territory."	it

But I did notice a drop in alertness and when we debated the amendments of our Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, you mentioned the Greens on their own in every instance. We are a group of unity in diversity. We want to bring this across in Parliament. I would ask you to use the full name of our Group. Very well, I shall do so.

(DE) Madam President, I have an oral amendment which is in fact a clarification, because the passage concerned has been formulated differently in various translations. I hope the person who tabled the amendment will agree to this. The second sentence should read: '.., weshalb diese Hilfen' (which is why we have this aid), then 'ohne Bedingungen und' (unconditionally and) should be deleted, and it continues as follows: 'ohne Abhängigkeit von reziproken Anweisungen von seiten des Geberlandes gewährt werden müssen' . (and therefore that the aid must not be dependent on the reciprocal orders from the donor countries). This clarification would certainly meet with our approval. Are there any objections to the inclusion of this oral amendment? (Parliament agreed to the oral amendment) - Relating to Amendment No 9 I just wanted to make it clear - as it has been translated differently here - that we always use the official name FYROM. Absolutely, I do not think that will pose a problem.

The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself. The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event. The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities. These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities. Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes. Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these. Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked. Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis. As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account. We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds. Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks. We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience. Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this. We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen. The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate. It is time that polluters started to pay because, up to now, it has been those affected and taxpayers who have paid, and they have not just paid but cleaned up the affected areas as well. I am therefore delighted at Mr Fischler' s response, particularly his recognition of the need to apply retroactive measures and to give a rapid response to the applications submitted. On behalf of the PSE Group, I want to send a message of solidarity to those affected, to the fishermen, farmers and businesspeople who enable the products of the sea to be regularly brought to market. My message of solidarity also goes out to the mayors and politicians, to the volunteers who have worked to clean the affected areas and to all those who deserve our full support.  I wish to put two questions to the Commissioner. Parliament has passed a resolution calling for the polluter pays principle to be applied in this instance and for both the shipowners and the owners of the cargo to be liable.	de
"Mr President, I share the view that we need to make more progress from the point of view of efficiency and the analysis of the cost-effectiveness of the services offered. But as an entrepreneur myself, I really cannot understand why it is always assumed this can only be done under the headings of ""privatisation"" and ""liberalisation""! Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations. Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy. In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment. I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right. Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services. Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk. Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union. So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent. Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days. On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying. We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile. In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset. Mr President, the 1997 directive, issued on 21 January 1998, which undertook the partial liberalisation of postal services in Europe, envisaged a revision at a later date, in a rather convoluted manner, indeed, since it was to be dealt with in a Commission proposal by the end of 1998, then decided by 1 January 2000, to come into force finally by 1 January 2003. Well, for the time being, the revision has not got off the starting block. The two initial phases were not observed which, logically, ought to compromise the third. My first question is this: surely the scheduled time limits were too short in any case? Apparently, they were. It is really not possible to see how the Commission could by the end of 1998, as stipulated by Article 7 of the directive, have evaluated the effects of a text which came into force in February of the same year."	fr
I call on Members to ensure by their votes today or that we can put Europe on a sound footing for the short term, if not for the long term. Mr President, I must firstly thank the rapporteur, Mr Schmidt, my colleague, Mr Goebbels, and Mrs Villiers and Mrs Lulling from my Group. Despite their differing opinions on some points, they have consistently worked in an extremely constructive manner. As indicated by the rapporteur, we are discussing probably one of the most important issues that we will ever have to discuss in this Parliament. Collective investment undertakings have for some time been the primary savings vehicle through which millions of ordinary citizens, without any specialist knowledge, have invested their life savings. This is the main reason why we must proceed with liberalisation, albeit in a prudent manner. I say this because the failure of a bank is a problem for which any government can find a solution. However, the failure and suspension of payments of this type of undertaking would create a political, social and personal problem with incalculable consequences. There is also a second reason why prudence is needed in the regulation of these undertakings. I believe in a social market economy based on a successful market operating subject to certain rules intended to guarantee the general interest. Specifically, at the moment, this means the protection of investors. This basic principle of liberalisation, increased competition and greater investment opportunities, together with prudence to ensure the protection which investors deserve, has determined and inspired my Group' s position on most of the controversial points which have arisen. Firstly, there is the problem of investment in non-harmonised undertakings falling outside this directive. It is clear that by extending the proposal under discussion, the options and the range of investments in undertakings for collective investments, those undertakings which remain outside the rules will be obliged to invest in high-risk funds. It would be wrong to allow the regulated and protected undertakings to invest in other undertakings involved in such risky investments. Secondly, the problem of derivatives is one which has created the most divisions, both within my Group and between the groups. We have achieved a compromise solution. Everyone accepts that investments in derivatives must be legally limited in order to prevent a harmonised fund losing all its assets due to an investment in high-risk products. It is clear that this risk is greater when the investment is in derivatives not dealt in on a regulated market, namely the famous OTC derivatives. We have achieved an acceptable compromise solution on this, or so we believe, which I welcome. As this issue will be returning to this House at some stage, I must highlight the working method used between the Commission and this Parliament. The texts before us today are old and were already old when they reached this House. This was because they were substantially amended during the Finnish Presidency. We are therefore faced with two options. We can either return the proposals to the Commission for the latter to present a harmonised text or we can continue the current process.	es
Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America. Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region. However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki. I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them. The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago. Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent. These were essentially of three types which I will describe. The first was the decision to establish within the European Union three committees for decision making relating to crisis management. The first is a political and security committee, the second is a military committee representing the Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen Member States and the third committee is to make decisions on the European Union' s relations with third countries and other organisations. This basically involves relations between the European Union and the Atlantic Alliance and relations between the European Union and those countries which, although geographically in Europe, are not part of the European Union, or at least not at the moment. I will restrict myself to these three points in order to bring you up to date with events. Firstly, with regard to the decision-making bodies, the Political and Security Committee met for the first time this morning, 1 March 2000. This committee was established by the last General Affairs Council. Therefore, two months after the Helsinki declaration and decision, a Political and Security Committee meeting has taken place for the first time within the European Union. I was able to attend this meeting this morning and met with the representatives at lunch. You can be satisfied with the progress made. The fifteen countries have appointed diplomatic experts at ambassador level in order to tackle one of the most important issues which we will face in the coming months. Secondly, the Military Committee, which represents the various Chiefs of Staff of the fifteen countries, will hold its first meeting on 7 March which will be just over two months after the Helsinki declaration. This Military Committee, as you can imagine, will have various duties. In the interim stage, its basic duty will be to advise the Council and myself and to take initial decisions on how to set up the final bodies which we will, of course, try to have in place by the end of this year or the beginning of next.	de
Furthermore, we should utilise an extraordinary budget line, since this is an extraordinarily catastrophic situation. First of all, we would like to express sympathy with all the families and communities that lost members in this terrible tragedy. It is really the loss of life that makes this particular disaster an extraordinary one by European standards. It is regrettable that we do not have any instrument with which to give assistance in situations like this. I want to thank the Commissioner for his comprehensive statement on the subject and his suggestion that we might indeed organise ourselves at European level to give assistance to Member States and regions that have tragedies like this. That is important. The other thing we should remember is that we did have a budget line in the past. It was very small. It was not able to do very much but it was repeatedly abused by Members of this House proposing action when the disasters were not even major. Officials and ministers from Member States were coming to Brussels, whispering with the Commission and getting a few euros and making a political point by bringing aid back to their constituencies. So there was not much sympathy for this budget line when it was abolished. I think we should reinstate this budget line. When we had the earthquake in Greece, which was a big disaster, the Community had no instrument with which to offer its sympathy or solidarity to the Greeks. The same when the floods came in France and the same again now. These are major disasters, we should have an instrument, we do not have it. We should reinstate that instrument and we should make the rules tight so that only in situations where grave disasters occur will we call up this particular instrument. We can save it from year to year and ensure that when something major happens we have an instrument to deal with it. We did not have it so bad in Ireland this time although we have had many serious wind storms on the Atlantic. We had floods in Ireland also and I want to express my sympathy with the people in Ireland who suffered from these. Ladies and gentlemen, none of us must forget what has taken place. It is true that there was a joint decision by the Council and Parliament seeking to discontinue emergency lines. It is also true that there is a lot of European money around. Commissioner Barnier has pointed out that oyster farming and agriculture would be eligible under Article 30 of the regulation concerning rural development, forestry would be eligible under Article 33, companies would be eligible under exemptions from the competition law stated in Article 87(2) of the Treaty and public facilities would be eligible under the Structural Funds. It is nevertheless the case that not a penny more than what was allocated before the storm will now be freed up to demonstrate practical, active solidarity. It is nothing more than the States playing at taking from Peter in order to give to Paul.	es
It is clear that electronic mail, electronic commerce is going to become extremely important in the future. I also see this as offering special potential for the existing postal service. We know that until the year 2002 it will not be possible to fill some 1.2 million jobs in the field of electronic commerce because we do not have the skilled workers needed for this market. I believe that this opens up very extensive employment potential in the postal administration in particular, which can prepare its existing staff for this very interesting challenge by means of training and further training measures. Of course the existing rural post offices also have a strategic advantage, because they are so densely distributed throughout Europe. Even the tiniest village has a post office and in future e-commerce will make far more use of the post because many people will order goods by e-mail and through websites and also send bills and so forth by that means. That is why the physical handling of these transactions will also become increasingly important. The collection, sorting, transportation and delivery of mail will take on an entirely new dimension. I believe that in future we must seize this opportunity. As politicians we must devote special attention to defending consumer interests. We want our consumers to obtain as much as possible for the wages they are paid. That faces us with the very important challenge of offering the consumers cheaper postal services. We should take a look - thinking also of benchmarking - at what the consumer currently pays for an employee in the existing postal services and what he pays for an employee in the private sector. This transparency is also very important for the unions, for how can a union official who has to represent his members in a private company compete with a union official who has to represent his members in the postal service? I think it is important for the unions too to operate under uniform economic and social framework conditions so as to achieve the best results for their members on a basis of justice, fairness and solidarity. But I also believe that in future we will have to make the universal service sufficiently attractive. We should define the universal service precisely, establish efficiency criteria and then issue invitations to tender. In rural areas where we have real fears that these services really can no longer be cost-effective, I believe the decision should be taken by a regulator who can lay down fair and decent tendering conditions, so that all the market forces, and of course the existing postal services too, can compete here and so that we can pursue the best and most efficient consumer strategies. I believe we must avoid further subsidies and should try to ensure that the private supplier and the consumer benefit from the new system. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, postal services, just like any European public service, contribute to the social cohesion of Community territory under the terms of Article 16 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. By equalising tariffs, i.e. treating citizens and economic operators on a basis of strict equality with regard to the cost of the service, by meeting the obligation to provide a universal service, while complying with the requirement for quality of service, postal services reflect the concern which we must have to ensure equality between different regions and the people resident in them.	it
It is true that economic aid is, in this respect, certainly an essential element to the scope of action afforded those people active at the grass roots level. Let me reiterate the comment which Doris Pack has just made and stress that we, the Members of the European Parliament, must fulfil our own obligations in this regard, while ensuring, of course, that we are not the only ones to do so. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Brok, for his report. If the Council had worked as quickly as Mr Brok then we would certainly be a great deal further on. The Council' s failings in this respect are a source of much regret. The rapporteur and the report are right to start from the premise that we should, and must, provide help swiftly, however it is also right to start from the premise that we will not provide help indefinitely or at random. I would particularly like to draw your attention to Amendment No 5 at this point, which clearly emphasises that it is only possible, and permissible, to use the funds from the special financial aid to finance those Kosovan budgetary requirements arising from public or semi-public, communal and other authorities and institutions, which are controlled either directly or indirectly by UNMIK. Commissioner, it must be made clear that we support UNMIK and the institutions set up by the United Nations, in particular Pillar 4 of course, and it will not do for us to support the parallel structures that have formed in Kosovo and are still in place. What is to be done with this money? I would like to highlight the issue of human rights. The West fought for human rights in Kosovo and what is happening there today? We were able to put a stop to the mass expulsion campaign carried out by the Serbs but almost every day insupportable things happen: people are killed, people are prevented from living there or are prevented from living their lives as they see fit. Every single day there are attacks on Serbs, on the Roma, on Bosnians, but attacks are also still carried out on Albanians. I was in fact shocked to read in the report, assuming this is true, how an Albanian doctor, who was working in the hospital in the Serbian quarter of Mitrovica under what must have been great difficulties, ultimately had to give up helping his kinsmen in this hospital because there were constant threats on his life. These are events and situations that cannot be tolerated. I hear - whether it is true or not I do not know - that the Serbs are even continuing to operate a mine in the Serbian sector of Kosovo. There are, at the very least, rumours that Serbian militias are up to their old tricks again. It is irrelevant, as far as I am concerned, as to whether it is Serbs, Roma, Bosnians or Albanians who are threatened or killed in Kosovo. It is also irrelevant, in my view, as to who is working towards separation and division in Kosovo. What is all-important, to my mind, is that the bodies we are financing should achieve what we want them to achieve, a multi-ethnic Kosovo that is, a Kosovo where people can live together.	fr
The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version. However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands. The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal. This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal: Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation. This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive. Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms. Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions. We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason. Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive. I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason. Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment. This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements. Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council. The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes. The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised. However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments. I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks. It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments.	es
Once again, I would like to reiterate my appreciation of the quality of work carried out, not only by the rapporteur, but by the committee as a whole. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon. Closing of the session I declare the 1999-2000 session closed. (The sitting was closed at 10.41 p.m.) Opening of the session I declare resumed the 2000-2001 session of the European Parliament. Agenda Mr President, the second item on this morning' s agenda is the recommendation for second reading on cocoa and chocolate products, for which I am the rapporteur. Quite by accident I learnt yesterday, at 8.30 p.m., that the vote was to take place at noon today. It was however initially scheduled, I thought, for noon tomorrow. I have therefore been caught completely off guard by this, and have not even had the chance to draw up the lists of votes and to see whether there are any roll-calls or not. You know as well as I do that this matter is quite controversial and well reported in the media. I have been a Member of this Parliament for ten years and I have always been given notice, in my capacity as rapporteur, of any changes to the order of voting. I should prefer for this vote to be held tomorrow. It would suit me, personally, and I do not think anyone would have any objection, since it is a relatively brief vote. Mr President, we do not have anything against postponing the vote. However, I insist on the other scheduled votes, particularly those on the Lisbon Summit, going ahead tomorrow. We have nothing against postponement, with this proviso. The competent services have informed me that tomorrow' s list of subjects will be rather lengthy. Mr President, like Mr Lannoye, late last night I too was faced with the fact that the vote on my report at second reading is planned for 12.00 p.m. The groups have emphatically asked me to urge you not to let the vote take place at 12.00 p.m. but tomorrow instead, as they have not had the chance to apply for split and roll-call votes. After all, it came as a complete surprise that the vote was planned for 12.00 p.m. I would therefore ask, also on behalf of many others, to postpone the vote until tomorrow. Mr Blokland, the officials of the competent services have informed me that your report will automatically be put to the vote tomorrow. I now ask the House whether it agrees to postpone the vote on the Lannoye report until tomorrow. If we are all in agreement, that is what the arrangement will be. Annual legislative programme (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the European Commission' s annual legislative programme for the year 2000. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, if the citizens of Europe are looking for this kind of Europe, then Brussels, and especially the Commission, is where they will look. Being a parliamentarian, that does not please me, but I have to accept the situation, for the moment at least, and until further notice. But this also means that the Commission faces an immense challenge. If you want to bring about the great turning point you mentioned, Mr President of the Commission, then you had better make a start on this damn quickly.	de
I am also delighted to be able to confirm that I shall be participating in the Joint Assembly' s next meeting, which takes place in March in Nigeria. The Commission is pleased to see the Joint Assembly playing a larger role, especially in connection with promoting a more extensive political dialogue with our partners in development. The Commission agrees with the rapporteur that combating poverty continues to be the central objective for development policy and will always play a key role. In order to be able to develop, the countries concerned must, however, become actively involved in the global economic system. With regard to trade with our partners in development, the Commission is quite prepared to guarantee that any new arrangement will take account of the ACP countries' special economic and social limitations. Mrs Lucas mentioned that the Stabex and Sysmin system ought to be continued with. I do not agree. That system has proved itself to be inappropriate because it is, in actual fact, of use only to relatively few of the 71 countries concerned. It operates too slowly, and it therefore stands to reason that the developing countries should have said yes to the new system of the future, because this will operate more flexibly. Regarding the future accession of countries such as East Timor to the Lomé Convention, I can only repeat what I recently said to the European Parliament' s Committee on Development and Cooperation, namely, that the door is open. It is the applicants themselves who are to decide whether they want to knock on the door. Once they have done so, we shall adopt a position on the matter. With regard to Cuba' s application for accession to the Lomé Convention, the Commission notes that, according to their recent declaration, the ACP States support Cuba' s application. The EU has always called for a constructive attitude to be adopted towards Cuba, as outlined in the EU' s common position, but it has to be recognised that the discussions will be complex. With regard to the Côte d' Ivoire, I can inform you that the whole of the EUR 28 million has been paid back in accordance with what was agreed following examination of the financial irregularities. With regard to financing the European Development Fund by an amount in excess of the budget, I can say that this is being considered. For its part, the Commission supports this, but we cannot at this point produce new reports on the whys and wherefores. Concerning Article 366A, I can say that, during the negotiations for a new partnership agreement, a new procedure was established for dealing with instances where human rights and the principles of democracy and the rule of law are infringed. It is now the case, following adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty, that Parliament wishes, on the basis of Article 300, to be kept fully informed of all decisions, and the Commission will continue to take account of Parliament' s decisions on this subject. There are no plans to follow the procedure involving concurrent statements in Parliament in connection with such decisions. This would in fact demand a change to the recently adopted Amsterdam Treaty. Finally, I would refer to the South Africa agreement, which the rapporteur also touched upon. In this regard, I am simply pleased - delighted, in fact - here this evening, as a conclusion to this debate, to be able, very appropriately, to inform you that South Africa' s President has today said yes to the solution which the EU' s Council of Foreign Ministers last Monday agreed unanimously to propose with regard to the outstanding problems regarding South Africa.	de
(Parliament approved the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro, on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C5-0091/1999 and SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809(CNS)) Before the vote Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent. I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time. Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts. Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' . The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is. It rather seems like a contradiction in terms. However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely. Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem. The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced. Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying. We shall address this problem and check all the translations. Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar. I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future. Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on. Relating to Amendment No 31 Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' . (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version. An 's' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta' which is completely the contrary. I just wanted to correct this.

This basis must include minimum conditions for access to Community waters and ports with regard to the age and characteristics of vessels; a general principle of environmental responsibility making it possible to determine the liability of the various operators, and particularly that of the charterer, and to impose heavy penalties. The Commission should ensure the coordination of information. It should not be afraid to confront the lax attitude of some major ports or major shipowners, and should make the issue of flags of convenience a central concern in the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus. Let me remind you that the Erika was registered in Valletta. All the same, States must clearly not shift their own essential responsibility onto the Union: the safety of all concerned is conditional upon the standards and effectiveness of inspection by the port State (and the resources made available for this). We must, and shall, remain particularly vigilant in the months to come in order to ensure that the victims who bear none of the responsibility whatsoever for this disaster receive compensation in full from the polluter, and to ensure that this time we do in fact learn the lessons from the oil slick in terms of maritime safety, so that polluters are deterred once and for all from gambling with the lives of our coastal populations. The most effective form of prevention is to ensure that any potential polluter is made liable to extremely heavy financial penalties. Katiforis report (A5-0017/2000) We agree that the fishing industry has the most to gain from promoting respect for the marine environment. We must nevertheless bear in mind that there are many factors that contribute to damaging marine areas, such as contamination and pollution by oil tankers and other maritime transport, industrial activity, the pressure of human activity on coastal waters and, of course, uncontrolled fishing activity. It is worth emphasising, however, that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing activity can be combined with sustainable development that does not threaten the marine environment. We feel that it is possible to create a fisheries management policy based on conserving the marine environment which is compatible with the interests of fishing communities. But in order for this to happen, we must specifically take account of the fact that there is a correlation between income from fishing and an increase in fishing effort. It is therefore necessary to adopt measures under the common fisheries policy and to provide appropriate financial resources to guarantee the income of those who depend entirely on fishing for their livelihood, such as fishermen, particularly at times when fishing activity is suspended or reduced. Hence the importance of our amendments, which sought to achieve this. - (FR) The Commission communication lists a series of objectives and proposals reporting the need to continue the efforts undertaken in the field of inspection and supervision, to adopt new technical measures under the heading of the selectivity of fishing techniques, monitoring the application of legislation in force, etc. In its communication, however, at the same time the Commission specifies that it is not in a position to ensure that this legislation is complied with. The fact is that there is no lack of existing measures and appropriate means. The Commission has a whole arsenal of restrictive conditions, measures and decisions (at both international and Community level) already in force in the fisheries and marine environment protection sectors.	de
Unlike Mrs Kaufmann, I am not in favour of extending supervision over the European Central Bank as I am an advocate of independence for the European Central Bank. However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side. Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility. The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this. We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate. There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to. The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor. I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights. The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences. What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice. For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty. In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on. If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union. This is the crux of the matter. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage. , chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager.	fr
The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform The next item is the Commission communication - The dialogue on Europe - institutional reform: the issues at stake. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is discussing this issue right now but it will be very surprising if its work is completed today. I am basically here to speak to you, as indicated by your agenda, on a new initiative which the Commission is proposing as just one of its responses to the major challenge of institutional reform. This reform must involve all the actors in European construction, with yourselves as MEPs at the forefront but also myself as a Commissioner, the Council ministers and national MPs. It must also involve the officials who work in our various institutions and who are committed to and motivated by this European construction. This morning, in the lengthy debate which I attended with Mr Prodi, many of you mentioned the lack of democracy and remoteness of the European institutions. Yet it is not just a question of who does what, as one of you said very clearly and forcefully. Ensuring that our citizens understand who does what in our various institutions is the very least we can do. We must also now explain what we are doing together and what we want to do together in the future, particularly with the countries which will be joining us. We too are concerned about this lack of democracy, and the Commission has therefore decided to launch the 'Dialogue on Europe' in order to play its part in this direct contact with the people. This initiative will be launched on the day after the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference. During the IGC I will have the honour of representing the Commission together with Mr Prodi and of working closely with your two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos. All the Commissioners have undertaken to use some of their time when they go to any country or region, and not just their own, which in my case happens three or four times a month, to engage in direct dialogue with the public, and not just with the élite or those in power whom we meet as a matter of course. We also plan to establish direct contacts in universities, schools and factories, to meet the people, answer their questions and listen to them. In this way we will play our part, as will you, in making the necessary effort and meeting the urgent obligation to reduce the democratic deficit and the remoteness of our citizens from what we do. We hope to conduct this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and in conjunction with the European Parliament. We will produce a regular summary of this initiative so that public opinion can be measured and we can adjust or reorient the work. We also hope to conduct this initiative in consultation with the national parliaments, local elected representatives, non-governmental organisations, socio-professional organisations and the media. Opinion multipliers, political groups and parties, MEPs and national MPs, elected representatives, as I have just said, local authorities or national parliaments, the Committee of the Regions, the Economic and Social Committee, organisations stemming from civil society and university and education circles will all be involved.	fr
I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve. But we shall have a decision very soon. (The Minutes were adopted) Reforming the Commission The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission. I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission. I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination. The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working. Today, that commitment has been fully discharged: you have the reform here, before you, in the form of an institutional White Paper which has just been adopted by the Commission. I would like to emphasise that, on that occasion too, the Commission voted unanimously, with one voice. Briefly, these are the main points of the reform. One: definition of political priorities and translation of these into practical measures through the focused use of resources. This is at the heart of the system, and it is this, the setting of political priorities and the focused use of resources, which will enable the political sphere to assert its primacy and to take its responsibilities fully on board. In order to do this, we have created a completely new policy-planning mechanism, a system which will allow the College to set annual policy guidelines and to establish the budgetary procedure on the basis of these, to assign well-defined objectives to the Directorates-General and to keep the relationship between available resources and activities assigned under control, which is of fundamental importance. In this context, activity-based management is the key to ensuring coherence between objectives, actions and resources. The second point is human resources. It is the central part of our reform. Our staff are the Commission' s best asset, its richest resource. They are extremely highly qualified, of a calibre which it is difficult, if not impossible, to find in the individual national administrations because of the nature of the recruitment methods and criteria used. This was the impression I received when I first became President of the Commission, and it has been confirmed by observation during my daily work. However, at the same time, I have found that morale amongst the Commission' s staff is very low. Previously, there was pride and pleasure taken in being part of a universally admired institution, but now staff are frequently demoralised by the unceasing criticism. All this has to change, and this is one of the main reasons for our reform. Recruitment, career development, mobility and disciplinary measures are all being based on completely new criteria: there will be greater emphasis on individual service, credible and, above all, verifiable performance appraisal systems, lifelong learning and a greater degree of management responsibility. These are the areas in which changes will be made. The third point, which was also rather a sensitive, key issue in the recent crisis, is financial management.	de
"Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it. We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you. I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform. The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories. Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty. I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed. Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty. It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty. We all agree on this. But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market. On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said. There have only been nine rejections. But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer. How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules! This is therefore an aspect to be considered. Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law. In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon. I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law. Here improvements should be made. Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction. Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others. What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call ""le parcours du combatant"", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment."	fr
I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February. Can you tell us your position on this subject? Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe. At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative. The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent. However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause. Mr Solana can play an important role in this. He is not stupid. Certainly not! He is a driven man, a competent man. But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence. In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit. One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President. From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament. His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact. It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold. This too is unacceptable in my view. Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power. Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself. Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly. We have also opted for a common and joint development along the road of democracy, cultural diversity and tolerance. But look at us now! We are observing the misery in Chechnya in a position of powerlessness, and regard the wars in Africa with indifference, despite the fact that we have close ties with so many of these countries, given that they are ex-colonies. Some of them are our ACP partners. The war is an extension of degenerated underdevelopment. In Kosovo, we stepped in with military means, having been unable to prevent the war in ex-Yugoslavia. We are now unable to guide the peace. This is why Europe is not credible as a Union. I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore this credibility by military means. As representatives from the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, we all come from nations and regions which have never gone out to war with foreign countries, but we always needed to fight those who came to oppress us. We are very sceptical about your current plans to form a military capability in the short term. This is not because we are against European defence, but European defence can and may only be the outcome of a sound, democratically-based decision process in respect of foreign affairs.	fr
"Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see. That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform. If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a ""hand-up"". I urge the House to support these changes. Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work. The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment. These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines. Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life. Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland. In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best. Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that. However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy. Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it. The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South. Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States. If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities. Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation."	de
In view of all this, we also believe the time has come to demand a redoubled effort by the Commission and the Member States, on behalf of those who are now drowning in Mozambique. The EUR 1 million which has so far been made available is completely inadequate in view of the needs which have been assessed by the Mozambican Government at 65 million dollars. The time has also come to demand greater efficiency. We hope that the debate at the beginning of this afternoon, the Commissioner' s knowledge of the situation in Mozambique and the visit by Mr Nielson will lead to a major effort being made by all sides to help Mozambique. Mr President, the situation in Mozambique is of the greatest urgency. Each day, each hour of delay costs many lives. There are only a few helicopters available to save tens of thousands of victims. The water levels continue to rise. Starvation and epidemics seem inevitable. It is as if the whole world is looking on, helplessly. The question is whether the Commission has reacted with sufficient alertness. I must admit that I have my doubts about this. Commissioner Nielson is flying out today. In European terms, this may be swift action, but given the emergency in Mozambique, this is probably very late. Unlike a number of Member States, the European Union has promised only very limited aid so far. What options does the Commission have, to offer effective help fast? What could emergency and reconstruction aid consist of? Can Commissioner Patten update us on the international coordination so far? Why was it not possible to come to the rescue with a larger number of helicopters sooner? The international community could also help Mozambique in an act of generosity by cancelling its debts, not only because the country has adopted a relatively sound policy, but especially because the extent of human suffering makes this absolutely essential. Mr President, all the reports and pictures reaching us bear witness to the scale of the tragedy afflicting Mozambique. There are thousands and thousands of displaced persons, a large number of dead, a lack of food and drinking water, and homes and crops have been destroyed. And this is happening in a country which, because it is one of the poorest in the world, does not have the minimal essential resources to help those affected as quickly as necessary. It is therefore vital for the EU and its Member States to intervene in a way which will enable us to provide this country and its people with rapid and exceptional help. We know that because of the dramatic nature of the situation, representatives of the Portuguese Presidency and Commissioner Nielson left today for Mozambique. We are pleased about this development, but what is more crucial than their presence is that they should guarantee that a short and medium-term action plan will be adopted and implemented immediately. This should be done in conjunction with the Mozambican government and this plan must be able to secure the aid that the situation requires. Furthermore, it was precisely for this reason, and also because I am convinced that what we really need now is urgent and exceptional action, that I spoke today to Commissioner Nielson - just before he left - in my capacity as Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation. I asked him to join us, as soon as he returns, to inform us about how the situation is developing and particularly about the emergency measures which the EU has already taken, and those which we are going to take.	de
Pensioners will, in the future - as is already happening - have enormous sums of money at their disposal. Indeed, whilst the young are penniless, the elderly have accumulated money and, since they are keen to turn it to good advantage, harbour great hopes for this directive. If national governments had in their hearts - as the European Union has in its heart with this directive - the proliferation of money earned during the course of a working life, the pensions time bomb would already have been defused. You too, in your role, Commissioner Bolkestein, have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly and of pensioners, a future that I hope will improve once we have finalised this directive, by which I mean very soon, as has been proposed by Mrs Villiers and Mrs Kauppi. . (NL) Mr President, could I first of all express my heartfelt thanks to rapporteur, Mr Olle Schmidt, and the members of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, which has principal authority, as well as the rapporteur, Mr Brian Crowley and the members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, whom I would like to thank for their thorough and important work on the refinement and extension of the proposals. Since the approval of Directive 85/611, the investment funds sector has undergone lengthy development and it is now important to modernise the rules. The aim of the new proposals is to maintain the highest level of protection for the benefit of investors, which is an essential precondition for market integration resulting from the launch of the euro. Since the average European family puts its savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions on prudent management - and I would like to underline this - prudent management as far as investment policy and risk-spreading are concerned. The two proposals form a coherent whole. The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest. As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets. Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision. Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques. The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector. By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years. The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas. The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements.	fr
Finally, I would like to emphasise that it is also important - and this is one of the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency' s programme - to note the view that it is necessary to recognise the value of development in the European Union' s policies, and in particular in the context of its foreign policy. We believe that this is absolutely vital, failing which we will be unable to take any consistent action as regards the coherence of policies, and we cannot do this without giving development policies their rightful place as an instrument for upholding the principles and values underpinning Europe' s status in the international system. For this reason it may be necessary, as I have stressed, to change the model and move away from the post-colonial model towards a more European approach to development policies. In this respect I believe - and some speakers here have also commented on this - that the adoption of the new convention, which succeeds the Lomé Convention, is an important instrument of renewal, and represents a new approach to a partnership with such an important group of countries from the south at a time of considerable instability in the international negotiating process, as demonstrated by the first negotiating round in Seattle. . I sense some degree of frustration in many of the contributions to this debate. I have given you a statement on behalf of the Commission which I think provides a useful background to this discussion. We will furnish more detailed material relating directly to all the issues concerning coherence. This discussion is not new. We are currently working on it in the Commission and when that work is done I will report on it, as many have been asking if it will be possible to see the report on coherence. I have no doubt that as a result of the increasing political attention attached to these problems - something which has clearly been reflected in the debate today - it will be easier for the Commission and the DG on Development to bring coherence to the forefront of our working agenda. This also calls for the introduction of further new mechanisms in the Commission system which may very well include, as suggested by some of the political groups in Parliament, the setting up of a special intra-service working group and the establishment of a kind of coherence watch in the Commission. I have read - and heard in the debate - that coherence is being used as some kind of a miracle formula that takes care of everything. I think it is important to keep it as a relatively clearly defined discipline of trying to reduce inconsistencies where they really exist, and we certainly do have them. Much of this has to do with real disagreement between sector interests in each and every Member State, as has been very honestly said here in this House: people more or less identify with their spheres of interest, and all this is legitimate.	es
If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient, and it has clearly been underestimated, then it must be raised. Our resolution calls for this. If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance. It would be particularly unfair to have an oil company, whose profits this year amount to FRF 10 billion, refusing to give 100% compensation to its own victims, the great majority of whom are small businesses and employees. Commissioner, the stricken people await tangible expressions of solidarity at European level. Our resolution calls upon the Commission to take the necessary steps to assist in repairing the damage caused in the fishing industry affected by the consequences of the disaster. Maritime Europe and the CFP must today demonstrate that, in addition to imposing constraints on fishermen, it is not unfamiliar with the concept of solidarity. The European Union must also participate in the restoration of the wetland and coastal environments affected, whose biological value is important to the Union as a whole. Mr Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France' s requests. I am pleased to hear it. We must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution. Twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster laxness and irresponsibility still reign supreme in Europe in matters of maritime safety, resulting in yet more oil slicks. This time, we must not let inertia win the day. A basis for maritime safety must be drawn up speedily, respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and we must at long last put an end to this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility. Mr President, the economy of the western Atlantic coastline has been devastated, polluted by oil from the Erika. Fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, workers in the tourist industry, and local and regional authorities are growing impatient while waiting for aid and for someone to deal with the time-bomb which the apparently still leaking wreck represents. Having withdrawn the budget line for 'natural disasters affecting Member States' with such poor timing, Europe has a duty to respond, firstly in the name of solidarity but also because it shares responsibility in this umpteenth oil slick disaster. European citizens find it hard to understand why Europe accepts conditions which the Americans refuse and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has until now blocked any measures to do with maritime safety. Europe must pass legislation at the earliest possible opportunity and investigate the matter of this wreck thoroughly, but, in the meantime, the Commission must, as a matter of urgency, harness European funds to aid the businesses affected in order to deal with the wreck, clean up the coastline, increase the capacity of waste storage facilities, ensure that waste is processed or recycled, and set up a research programme into the recovery of oil spilt at sea. Finally, the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for 'natural disasters involving Member States' , and make the regions affected eligible for Structural Funds. What is the Commission' s view of these proposals? What decisions has the Commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take?	fr
That is why sweeping reforms are necessary and, hence, a widened IGC agenda. The Finnish Presidency only listened to minimalist governments and, unfortunately, turned a deaf ear to this Parliament. Portugal should not take a leaf out its predecessor' s book. It is of the utmost importance that the European Parliament and the Commission join forces for this IGC. In many ways, they share the same interests and the same insights. An essential component of this joint effort should, in any case, be this Parliament' s right of assent to the forthcoming changes to the Treaty. Of all priorities, this one is the most pressing. What is the Commission' s verdict on this? It also means that our Parliament President and the two representatives should be able to take part on an equal political footing and, therefore, not only within the working party, but also at the same political level as the Commission. There is no reason whatsoever why representatives directly elected by citizens should be involved in talks at a lower level than the Commission. Not only do we owe the sweeping reforms to the new Member States, but we owe them to ourselves. If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire. Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation. After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC. The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion. Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council. A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today. Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda. If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this. Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union. I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council.	it
Forgive me Mr Poos. There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me. This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high. Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Question Time (Council) Question No 1 by (H-0022/00): Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika. At that time, bearing in mind the strength of public feeling about the disastrous consequences of this accident, the Council made known its concerns about the safety of oil tankers and the environmental protection that should go hand in hand with it. The Council was fully aware of issues of this kind and of the need to take additional measures in this field. It emphasised the importance of the Council taking new measures within a Community framework and in the context of its own work with international organisations. As you know, as currently framed, Community legislation requires port authorities to carry out inspections on board all foreign vessels, including those flying flags of convenience, and to detain them if they do not comply with international standards. There is a directive dating from 1995 on this subject. With regard to the future, the Council noted that work within the Commission should shortly lead to the publication of a communication on the safety of oil tankers and of new proposals to strengthen controls, together with provisions on the qualifications of inspecting agencies. There are also plans for a requirement to strengthen the actual structure of oil tankers visiting Community ports. These dossiers will be progressed by the Transport Council and I can therefore assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will not fail to give the highest priority to the proposals, which there is every indication the Commission is due to present in this area, which we regard as being a vital part of environmental protection. This House will of course also be invited to give its views on these proposals, given that these are matters subject to the codecision procedure. I am pleased that the Council is considering this question. The President of the Council comes from a country, Portugal, which is directly at risk from just this type of situation. If we stretched our imaginations, we could envisage a situation where, between now and next summer, an oil tanker may run aground under similar circumstances off the Algarve, wreck the Portuguese summer tourist industry, with a bit of luck the sea currents would carry the pollution towards the island of Madeira - because they move in that direction - and furthermore, wreck tourism in the Canary Islands as well.	it
The Commission insists on first evaluating such applications as to their safety and efficacy before giving authorisations. I can only ask you again to bear in mind the technical nature of the Commission proposal and to wait for the substantive proposal for a new directive on additives in feedingstuffs to address wider issues. I should just like to deal with some of the specific issues that were raised during the debate. First of all, regarding the observations made by Mr Graefe zu Baringdorf, I wish to assure him that we will change the procedure for authorisation of GMO additives in the Additives Directive 70/524, and not in the Novel Feed Directive. This is a directive that deals more specifically with raw materials rather than with additives. The text taken by Parliament is from the Directive which was adopted in 1998. But the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to carry out the environmental risk assessment of GMOs has changed since then and is still changing. It is before Parliament for second reading. It is my belief that we should await the final outcome of Directive 90/220 and in particular, Article 11. Reference was also made to the question of whether this proposal could give rise to the risk of the establishment of monopolies. Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi made reference to this. There are just a few points I should like to make on that issue. First of all, this matter has been in the pipeline since 1993, so it has not really been sprung on any other commodity producers. Indeed any such applicants can still apply in respect of their particular product. I should also stress that the Commission has never approved any application for an authorisation for GMOs to be included in additives. Mrs Roth-Behrendt made reference to the question of the appropriate legal base, whether it should be Article 37 or Article 152. I again refer to what I said earlier in relation to this and assure her and the House that it would be entirely inappropriate for the Commission to seek to justify any measure based on Article 37 merely by excluding from the provision any reference to public health. This is an issue that has been looked at on at least two separate occasions by the European Court of Justice, which has laid down the legal criteria for situations such as this where the appropriate legal base has to be properly taken into account when putting forward legislation. The jurisprudence of the Court appears to be quite clear in relation to this. As an overall comment to the suggested amendments here, particularly in relation to the legal base issue, it would be inappropriate, in my opinion, to change the legal base to Article 152 in these circumstances, as it would be very likely to fall foul of the objective criteria that have been laid down by the Court. A number of you made reference - Mr Nicholson in particular - to the issue surrounding labelling.	fr
Adopting this report would have serious consequences for agriculture in the EU if concentrations of, for example, phosphorus and nitrogen could not exceed the background values for these substances in the aquatic environment and if a limit of zero were to be established for pesticides in the aquatic environment. European agriculture would not, for example, be able to grow bread grain with a high enough protein content for it to be used for making bread. As a result, agricultural production would move to other countries outside the EU, with consequent high socio-economic and employment costs. I cannot vote in favour of the sections in the Water Framework Directive which deal with these states of affairs. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, water is a precious raw material. Millions of people do not even have clean water - a absolute necessity for survival - at their disposal. It should, therefore, not surprise us that water is the cause of wars. The capitalist world too sends out its pawns in order to gain maximum control over water reservoirs. General interest or solidarity often do not come into the equation. Europe is therefore facing an arduous task; that of combining a Community water policy which is fragmented in terms of objectives and means into more coherent framework legislation. I have to admit that in Flanders, where I come from, we still have a long way to go too. We were recently rapped on the knuckles by the Commission regarding this matter. Anyone with any sense would like to see this framework directive used as a big stick for those pursuing policies who are now failing in some way. The common position is in this respect a farce, a document with no strings attached and a true affront in the light of the OSPAR agreements. The period of implementation can even be extended up to 34 years. By then, my children will be older than I am now. You have to admit: this is a joke. Tomorrow, we might opt in favour of a weak and permissive framework which ruins the future of our children. Either we opt for the amendments of my group, of the rapporteur or the Committee on the Environment. I would like to finish off with this observation. In the past couple of months, we have witnessed a great deal of lobbying in Belgium. What was remarkable about this dossier was the enormous pressure from the Council of Ministers. In our own country, this pressure was exerted by both Flemish and Wallonian Environment administrations. They have opted for the weak common position in favour of our Parliament' s more drastic positioning. I really do wonder whether this is an approach of which the green Environment Ministers in my country are aware. Ladies and gentlemen, fine words are no longer sufficient. We need to change tack completely. During the vote tomorrow, we can make it clear that Europe is drafting a responsible and future-orientated water policy. This can only benefit our credibility. The debate is suspended and will resume at 9 p.m.	fr
Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model. In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand. I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about. May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly. If you apply the existing principle of digressive proportionality, six seats for every state and then one more seat for every half a million inhabitants, you already have the situation where Luxembourg with 367,000 people has more Members in this Chamber than Wales, which is a partly self-governing region of the United Kingdom. Scotland, with a population of 5 million, has eight seats in this House at the moment; Denmark and Finland, with the same population, have sixteen. Now what is going to happen if we retain a ceiling of 700, bring in 26% more population over time, and then adopt the Commission' s, I think ill-considered, proposition, that there should be a European list of candidates. What will happen to a place like Scotland, which I represent here? It will become totally invisible! Members of this House should not in these circumstances be in the least surprised that in these discussions, people in Scotland and other such countries are asking whether enlargement should not also take the form of admitting new Member States from within existing ones. A growing body of opinion in Scotland holds that view. Mr President, to say that the European Union is at a crossroads is no doubt nothing new. It has been said many times. This time, however, it is true. We have established the single currency - which is extremely positive - and we are facing enlargement. The question is if we will undertake enlargement whether we are prepared or not. Will we enlarge with or without deep reform? That is the debate, and this question must be addressed in any discussion of the Intergovernmental Conference, its agenda or its method. It is clear that the Council, for the moment, has not opted for enlarging with deep reforms in place. That puts enlargement in danger. It jeopardises any prospect of political union and, of course, it is difficult for the public to understand.	es
We share the same basic views but the Rapkay report lays emphasis on several points that we shall need to consider very carefully. I will mention only two, in order to be brief. The first is greater transparency. Parliament knows how important we all consider the question of transparency in competition policy, as I did right from the moment I had my hearing, on 1 September, in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs. As regards the international aspect of competition policy, I can confirm, Mr Rapkay, that the Commission is willing to provide Parliament with a report on this subject, to which Mrs Randzio-Plath has also drawn our attention. We have very satisfactory bilateral relations with the relevant American, Canadian and Japanese authorities as regards competition policy, and we are working to ensure that competition is treated as a separate topic within the World Trade Organisation. Mr Jonckheer, I would like to thank you just as warmly for your report on the seventh survey on State aid in the European Union. I will not talk about codecision here, but this certainly does not mean I do not consider it important. It has major institutional implications which obviously go beyond the specific area of competition; I am therefore not qualified to give an opinion, and this is obviously a matter for the broader context of the Intergovernmental Conference. With regard to your suggestions, Mr Jonckheer, you already know that my staff, who, although short-handed as usual, are fortunately highly qualified, are working hard to produce the register of State aids and the State aids 'scoreboard' . I am awaiting with great interest the results of the eighth survey, which, according to the scheduled timeframe, should be being drawn up by the staff now, in January, and for adoption by the Commission in March 2000, to see whether the latest trends are confirmed. Mr Jonckheer, Mrs Thyssen and Mr Gemelli raised the issue of the state of preparation of the candidate countries in terms of competition in general and of State aid. I can only say very briefly, that we are actively working with them on a practical level: they are making preparations, they now all have competition laws and are setting up the relevant authorities. I can also say, in respect of your concerns on energy and especially on the environment - which, as you know, I share - that we are concluding the review of the organisation of environmental State aid. In connection with the issue of State aid, I would also like to take up one of the points raised by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen, among others regarding repayment of illegal aid. In April 1999, the Commission adopted new Rules of Procedure which introduced specific rules on repayment. In the near future - and I can assure you of this - you will see just how seriously we mean to take these rules. Finally, Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen warmly for his report, which, although geared more towards a specific sector, is a valuable contribution.	es
"This goes to show just how topical this subject is. We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April. However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries. You only have to realise that the category of ""least developed countries"" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990. Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message. Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries. It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears. This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould. In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context. A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries. This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue. We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points. Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these. This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade. But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle. I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area."	it
It is probable, therefore, that there is a lot of life out there, and much of it much more advanced than we are. Bearing in mind that the first television programmes from earth are now 50 light years out into space way beyond the nearest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what life out there in the stars thinks of us as they look at us. What do they see? They see a beautiful planet, teeming with life, but they see its atmosphere being polluted and warming up. They see forests being cut down and deserts spreading. Of the living creatures, they can see many animals that are treated cruelly, rare ones becoming extinct for ever. How do they see the currently dominant species - that is us? Well, they see the planet's resources being unevenly spread. They see land being fought over, medicine for disease but not in the parts of the world where it is most wanted, books for schools - but not at all in the least-developed areas of our world, 50% of the world's population never making a telephone call in their whole life. What do they see about the relationships between human beings? They see us killing each other. They see us restricting each other's liberties. They see a never-ending series of local wars. They see some of our children drafted into the army as soldiers, or treated as prostitutes or slaves. They see unequal treatment of men and women, of people of different ages, of minorities, of people of different coloured skins, of races, of beliefs, of immigrants, even neighbours. We all know the picture. The UN Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to correct this. We should salute it - and I think we do. Only in Europe are human rights enforceable in law. Here in the European Parliament some of the Members do not want the Charter of Rights, which is being discussed at the moment, to become enforceable in law. I say: shame on them! Human rights should be enforceable in law in every country of the world. That is the goal which we have to work towards. Much, as Commissioner Patten said, remains to be done. Finally, if you asked me: What if there is no life out there among the stars, what if we are alone? - which is an equally awe-inspiring thought - I would say: Do not you think we have a responsibility too to make our children behave properly, before letting them go out to populate other planets? Mr President, human rights are universal, indivisible, interrelated and interwoven. This well-known phrase, which is taken from the conclusions of the UN World Conference on human rights of 1993, is known off by heart by many. That is positive. But what about the human rights policy within the EU itself? Does it reflect this vision of coherence? In fact, does the European Union have a human rights policy? This question does not challenge the efforts made by the Member States who wish to bring their viewpoints on foreign policy into line and to display a united front against violations of human rights elsewhere, for example in China.	it
What I do see right across Europe is people drinking Coca Cola, eating hamburgers, wearing baseball caps, watching Hollywood films and often doing all this at the same time. Now I do not believe that protectionism and regulation is the way of defending Europe' s culture, but I do believe in lending a helping hand when we can. That is what Culture 2000 is about. So, I say to the Council of Ministers: Keep this programme genuinely under review. Are we doing enough? And, I say to Madame Reding, thank you for the support and the help you have given so far, keep up the good work, we are on your side. Madam President, I too would like to warmly thank the rapporteur, Graa Moura, and Commissioner Reding, for their contribution to the creation of this programme. The Culture 2000 programme was finalised at the end of last year as a result of conciliation between Parliament and the Council. The outcome can be considered reasonable, when we take into account the fact that the adoption of the programme called for a unanimous decision to be made in the Council. We have to hope that at the forthcoming IGC we will also end up with qualified majority decisions in the area of culture. It is really strange that legislation that adheres to the codecision procedure when it is being debated requires unanimity for it to be passed in the Council. The framework programme on culture is replacing the present Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Raphael programmes. When implementation of the programme begins, I hope in particular that the scope it offers for literature and the translation of books can be utilised to the full. I believe and hope that, despite the assault on us all of the new technology, literature will maintain its status. We need the depth of spirit that literature provides in the midst of a culture that has a short attention span and is inclined towards the superficial. Literature likewise plays an important part in the way it transmits our cultural heritage, increases mutual familiarity and preserves linguistic wealth and the diversity of tongues. In this connection, I am very glad to say that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programmes get under way officially at the meeting of the Council of Ministers in March in Lisbon, the country holding the presidency of the EU is to organise a conference to discuss the situation of public libraries. I hope that this conference will also encourage the Commission to take the issue of libraries into active consideration in the fifth framework programme in respect of the information society. Madam President, Commissioner, rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, somehow or other, today' s agenda has come full circle. We have had a great deal to say today about Europe as a community of values, about tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive approach to the enlargement process, transparency and respect for each other. Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools for creating these values, for giving the citizens confidence in the European Union and making it credible in their eyes.	es
"Or perhaps people are not concerned with creating the same conditions of access to the postal services for all, but are thinking only of the capital employment conditions for companies in large conglomerations. Members should however represent all the citizens, which means it is their duty to think not in terms of business management but in terms of the national economy. In practice that means the following for the postal services: firstly, priority must be given to employment. I have nothing against liberalisation and privatisation, but the premises must be right. Secondly, we must guarantee that the citizens are not faced with reduced postal services. Examples in Germany and Sweden show that this certainly is a risk. Mr Stenmarck, Sweden is the only country in which prices rose far higher after liberalisation than in all the other Member States of the European Union. So that is another potential effect and one that we must prevent. Thirdly, it is vital to have, first of all, a universal postal service at an affordable price for all citizens, wherever they may be; secondly, to have a uniform price for all Member States; and thirdly, to have daily mail deliveries and collections on working days. On the question of the cost-effectiveness of the various postage weights, it is worth considering further price cuts; but that is what the postal administration itself is saying. We do not have to adhere to a weight of over 300g when the analysis shows that we need to ensure a minimum weight of 150g to make it at all worthwhile. In that respect I believe it was right and important to hold this debate today, to make Mr Bolkestein aware of Parliament' s position and allow him to take certain aspects into account from the outset. Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered. During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking ""that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."" What has become of it? Do we have the results of this impact study? As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service. Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation. Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed. This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service. I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, ""The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000"" - you can see how topical this is - ""the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."""	de
"I therefore think that this issue should be included as a matter of urgency in the IGC agenda, and in itself this justifies a thorough revision of the Treaties. We feel that at present the central issues about convening an Intergovernmental Conference to amend the Treaties are far more important than the controversy taking place here about the size of the agenda. They are also more important than the controversy over the appropriateness or otherwise of formulating proposals for new issues to be covered, and more important than the controversy over the extent of Parliament' s participation in it. We feel that these issues result from the IGC' s appropriateness and its objectives, as well as from the matters which will inevitably be discussed there. We have doubts concerning the appropriateness of the IGC because we fear that the objectives actually being addressed may be far removed from the changes required to allow for the enlargement envisaged. This relates in particular to the intended agenda, particularly as regards the Amsterdam leftovers, which suggests that unacceptable inner cabinets will be created in the future. This also identifies areas relating to the second and third pillars, which tend to be reflected in an undesirable militarisation of the European Union. These are some of the basic reasons why we do not agree with the aims of the motion for a resolution now before us. - The European Parliamentary Labour Party has abstained on the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulos Report. The text is overambitious, and Britain' s Labour MEPs believe that the IGC should primarily deal with the ""Amsterdam left-overs"" in order to prepare for enlargement, and not expand far beyond these. There is currently a great deal of work under way in terms of reform and this must be the priority for the moment to allow consolidation and strengthening of the EU institutions. Expansion of the agenda and drastic revision of the treaties would bring with it a risk of de-stabilisation. The key factor in this text as it has been amended, is the call for a Charter of Fundamental Rights to be incorporated into the treaties. In our view, this would bring with it a complex legislative burden, and it would be preferable to have a political and declaratory charter which explains to citizens what their existing rights are. Our priorities (i.e. the ""left-overs"" ) must be: the number and responsibilities of Commissioners weighting of votes in the Council extension of QMV in areas where it will benefit the UK and Europe (but not Treaty change, defence matters, border controls or taxation), and extension of codecision wherever QMV is extended Beyond this, we have concerns that the ""flexibility"" or enhanced cooperation suggestion is not appropriate at present. The provisions of Amsterdam are largely untested and allowing more scope for opt-outs could weaken the EU at the time when enlargement is being considered and applicant countries are being asked to sign up to single market and other European legislation. - (SV) In order to be able to influence developments, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude towards the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference than emerges from the present resolution, which displays far too much disappointment and negativity about the decision which the European Council made in Helsinki in December 1999."	fr
As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid. Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission. There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these. The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly. Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future. The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament. As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry. According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases. Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid. In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany. Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid. The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996. These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether. In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece. However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report. As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired. There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code. No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe. This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years. Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations. We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind. The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision.	it
The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles. The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action. It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation. We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job. Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents. Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight. Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report. I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this. I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments. I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic. I think that this is also the case here, but I think it would be a bit over the top to spend too much time talking about these 100 amendments. I would also point out that our coordinator on the Budgetary Control Committee is Mr Pomés Ruiz, who is Spanish and has hence made a major contribution to this debate from a Spanish perspective. Mr President, one of the key aspects which have been mentioned is, to my mind, the rapporteur' s proposal for the standing committee on standards in public administration. A very important proposal indeed. I am only very surprised that the Socialist group would like to subordinate this proposal to one tabled by Mrs Morgan, because she wants to scrap it altogether. I cannot fully grasp the underlying rationale. On the one hand, we receive all kinds of words of praise for the rapporteur but, at the same time, Mrs Morgan wants to pursue a sort of scorched earth policy on this point and on other key points as well, as a result of which, in fact, the entire content of this report vanishes. I do not know whether this is to appease Mr Kinnock, but I happen to know Mr Kinnock. He is happy to hear what our demands are and is quite prepared to be flexible if he considers it necessary. In my opinion, such a far-reaching scorched earth policy is really unnecessary. Finally, the issue of officials. Actually, I do not entirely share Mr Haarder' s view. I do agree that the section on officials has, in fact, been completed totally inadequately. First of all, the importance of a public service in general is not at all emphasised. Secondly, all kinds of proposals are nevertheless being mooted, and we have to ask ourselves whether these are terribly appropriate and whether they would lead to improvement.	fr
Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region. We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard. SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy. It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted. Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings. We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical. It is something that we can all support. I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving. We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports. We are not taking the kind of action that the citizens want to see. We are not making the connection so that the citizens can actually do something concretely either at home or in their offices or in industry to support action against global climate change. If we could communicate this it would be a very interesting thing to do. I would like once again to thank all who helped in this conciliation process. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I would once again like to thank Mrs Ahern for her work as rapporteur on this proposal, since she has contributed, in collaboration with the other Members, to the achievement of a very reasonable final result, which in some respects even improves on the proposals of the Commission itself and, of course, on what, from a budgetary point of view, the Council had initially accepted. As Mrs Ahern has explained very well, the budgets of both the SAVE programme and the ALTENER programme, are basically symbolic budgets, since the burden is shouldered by the countries, the States of the Union, the regions or even, in some cases, the local authorities. However, despite the fact that the volume is relatively small, it is nevertheless symbolically important that there is a common desire throughout the Community as a whole to support this type of action, which contributes to our genuine compliance with the Kyoto commitments. This action also contributes to achieving greater diversification in terms of our energy sources, greater safety in our energy supplies and, in the case of SAVE, to reducing consumption and increasing efficiency in the use of energy, thereby contributing to achieving the objectives set. Furthermore, behind these programmes, that is to say, the SAVE programme, which concerns greater efficiency and energy savings, and the Altener programme, which concerns renewable energy, there lies an extremely important technological challenge, which, from an economic point of view, may offer significant opportunities to industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and therefore in the Union as a whole.	fr
I will now describe, very briefly, the five areas where the most important changes may occur. First, the adjustments to the scope of what is meant by 'government institutional sector' under ESA 95. This is important, since government deficit means the deficit accumulated by all forms of government. The non-availability of precise criteria for the definition of government deficit would produce distortions in the estimates of the Member States' government deficits. Secondly, the deficit - or, if applicable, the surplus - means the ESA 95 government sector' s net borrowing requirement or lending ability respectively Thirdly, government investment means the gross fixed capital formation of the general government sector, as defined in ESA 95. Fourthly, government debt is defined in accordance with ESA 95, as are the flows or interest stemming from assets/liabilities. Fifthly and finally, the aggregate to which government debt will relate will be gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated in accordance with the 1995 European System of Accounts' definitions. To summarise, I consider that this proposal constitutes a satisfactory adaptation of the criteria laid down in the 1995 European System of Accounts, and I therefore approve it in full, as did the committee. Mr President, Commissioner, let me say at the outset that my group welcomes this proposal because it makes the basic statistical data for an economic and monetary union directed at stability and real growth more harmonised, directly comparable and more accurate. We have already heard about the various aspects involved. What I think is crucial is that henceforth the statistical data will be more reliable and comparable. We need that because the various European Union bodies and all the Member States within monetary union have to be able to depend on one another. It is important to adjust the procedure for two reasons. Firstly, for the single market. It is most important quite generally in a single market to have reliable and directly comparable data and statistics so as to give an accurate picture of the situation and development trends. Secondly, for economic and monetary union. The regulation dating from 1993 on the application of the Protocol must be brought into harmony with the methodology of the European system of accounts at national and regional level. That is vitally important to the accurate and reliable calculation of deficits. This adjustment will make it possible to estimate the deficits and debts in the Member States more precisely. These technical changes will have a very real impact on the actual position of the countries, since the data will automatically be amended in line with the public deficit. I also welcome the fact that the estimates of the deficits for the 1999 financial year that are due to be published in March 2000 are already based on the new ESA, i.e. the analysis is based on consolidated aggregates that are economically relevant. Let me also briefly use this debate as an opportunity to urge all the governments and political parties to do their utmost to ensure that this procedure never has to be initiated for an excessive deficit.	it
"I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this. But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand. I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained. But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany. Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too. It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve. If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics. Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power. To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply. Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today. I would like to quote verbatim from the report: ""State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."" I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation. I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe. Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper. I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000. I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace. No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe. The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with. But opinion differs as to the solution. The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation. In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse. Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system. I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law."	de
Hence, it is extremely important that this condition of accrual be adopted. Finally, I would like to reiterate that Mr Di Pietro has, in my opinion, delivered sterling work by submitting a report which, within the limitations, offers all possible guarantees for safeguarding individual human rights and fundamental freedoms. If, however, we would like to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we need to step up our efforts in the field of judicial cooperation. Mr President, my Group is delighted about the fact that an agreement will be reached to regulate the day-to-day practice of mutual assistance in legal affairs. The aim of regulations is to define the reciprocal rights and duties of States or citizens or those applicable in the relationship between citizens and government. The present proposal is complex, because it deals with agreements between Member States but has far-reaching consequences for the citizen-government relationship. It is precisely in the field of legal protection that the Council' s proposal leaves a great deal to be desired. In the words of rapporteur Mr Di Pietro, the proposal even contains colossal shortcomings. Thanks to the agreement, it is possible to create a chain of legal assistance requests, whereby each link represents authorities and criminal law systems of different Member States. The chain is arranged in such a way as to ensure that it cannot fall as a whole within the competence of one court. Additional measures are hence required, such as the obligation on the part of criminal investigators to give evidence in every criminal case in which their material is used. The fact that the Council' s proposal rides roughshod over the principle of proportionality is also hard to deal with for my Group. There are certainly no restrictions in its scope. As such, the agreement applies not only to fighting serious crimes and organised crime. In fact, it is not written anywhere that it is restricted to criminal law. It is, therefore, conceivable that the European Union will soon be taking a sledgehammer to crack a nut and that the rights of the citizen will vanish in the dust. Mr President, the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters that we are examining today contains the minimum requirements for efficient and rapid cooperation between the various judicial or investigative bodies concerned. It pertains, among other things, to notifications, information exchanges, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of property, testimonies via video conferences, investigative activities and 'undercover' activities, and the interception of telephone calls. This is the bare minimum on which an agreement can be reached, and it should immediately be said that if any amendments, such as Amendments Nos 32 or 81, or the revised Amendments Nos 70 or 71, were to be passed, the whole convention would be reduced to an exchange of notifications or information and at this point should simply be scrapped, and we would vote against it. I hope that the common sense of our fellow MEPs in the other groups will lead them to reject these amendments. The fact that the convention has not been turned into a framework agreement also constitutes a defeat for this Parliament.	fr
"It is right to focus upon access to, and use of, the Internet by public officials and by the education system and to create what has been called ""the learning society"" . It is also only right to concentrate upon access to venture capital and otherwise to reinforce the position of small and medium-sized businesses. In its discussion paper for the Summit, the Commission set quantified objectives for developments in the field of employment, including women' s employment, and for the fight against unemployment. In the same paper, the Commission also set the objective of mitigating the problems connected with poverty in Europe over the next ten years. I think it is only right to place the emphasis on common objectives, for countries' actual policies in this area will, and should, be different from one another. Some EU countries - mentioning no names - are struggling with high youth unemployment. In other countries - for example, in my own country, Denmark - youth unemployment is very low. Indeed, there is an outright struggle between employers and educational institutions to attract young people. There are differences between the countries when it comes to problems, systems, culture and tradition, and there should therefore be differences in the methods chosen in order to achieve the common goals of increased employment and reduced social exclusion. With the exchange of experiences and ideas as part of the Luxembourg process, employment policy is designed in such a way as to ensure that this will, in fact, be the case. Even if the problems we are facing over the next few years regarding both employment and social policy have a long list of features in common and therefore also constitute common challenges, it is as individual nations that we must solve some of these problems. However, it is also very important that countries should not work at cross purposes when solving the social problems in question but, on the contrary, that they should cooperate and provide each other with inspiration. I would say that it is important that we should aim to achieve common objectives, but that it is also important that individual countries should retain their responsibility for, and sovereignty in, establishing social and employment policy and that we should have a certain degree of competition between systems so as to ensure that social and employment policy is shaped in a progressive and dynamic way. Mr President, as representative of Flanders and on behalf of - what I would call - the nation regions, embodied in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, I was touched by your appeal for a powerful European approach, where the fifteen Member States do not try to gain power but where the power of cooperation increases. You pointed out that there are fifteen different public opinions, but, in fact, there are many more than that. There are, after all, huge differences within the Member States. Coming from Belgium, I do not need to point out that there is a difference of opinion between Flanders and Wallonia, or between former East and West Germany? Furthermore, our public opinion threatens to become polarised as a result of globalisation. Where there used to be a discrepancy between the haves and the have-nots, there are now those who can keep up as opposed to those who cannot or those who drop out of society. This is a very serious risk."	it
We expect the Commission to present this as part of its proposal for a social action programme. Social convergence is also needed before the enlargement of the Union, partly in order to strengthen the social model and partly to combat the risk of social dumping. The Commission ought to consider devising a special action programme concerning social policy in connection with enlargement. We have had a constructive discussion in the Committee. We had a lot of amendments, but succeeded in agreeing upon a report. Now, the amendments which are to be voted on at the plenary sitting have been reduced in number to only fifteen. This indicates that we have a broad consensus. A number of these amendments have come back from the Committee reading, and these I shall reject. I shall also reject those amendments which have been tabled by the Technical Group of Independent Members, because I do not think that these add anything to the report. On the other hand, my group will applaud Amendment No 14 from the group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party. I think this proposal is a good one. Certainly, it resembles Amendment No 1, but Amendment No 14 is better. Finally, I want to say that the EU is not only concerned with cooperation on trade. The EU is also a union for employment and social justice. In creating a citizens' Europe, social policy has an important role to play. By means of this report, Parliament wishes to make its contribution to reinforcing the social dimension of European society. We hope that the Council and the Commission will take this contribution seriously and include it in future social policy. The Lisbon Summit will provide an excellent opportunity to present a strategy of this kind. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Andersson, very warmly on his report on modernising social protection which is now under discussion. In the capacity of coordinator of the European People' s Party in the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, I am very pleased with the compromise which was reached and which Mr Andersson put so much effort into. I am also delighted that he based the report on a report which was written by myself as rapporteur under the previous Parliament and has partly followed the gist of this old report. The goal of the Commission' s notification of June 1999, on which the Andersson report is based, is to reinforce cooperation between the Member States and the EU in terms of social protection. Key sub-goals are: promoting employment and ensuring that work secures a fixed income; secondly, safeguarding old-age pensions and making these affordable; thirdly, promoting social integration and fourthly, guaranteeing affordable, first-rate health protection. Gender-related aspects must feature prominently in all these goals. I believe that congratulations are also in order for the Commission with regard to this notification, for these four points are, in fact, to a very large number of EU citizens extremely important - if not the most important points which merit further thought.	it
Diplomatic pressure is only successful when it is backed up by credible economic and military threats. Everything else is wishful thinking. That is why the Member States must either authorise more expenditure or rearrange their priorities in favour of modern mobile units so that our soldiers are protected by the best equipment. We are therefore delighted about the decisions which were taken last Monday in Sintra. The third heavy burden on your shoulders is the responsibility for ensuring parliamentary scrutiny. This should be exercised first and foremost in the Member States. No soldier can, of course, be despatched without the approval of the relevant national parliament. It is therefore wrong for people to talk about a European army. It will be a force comprised of various national units. What is new is that it will be well prepared and able to act quickly under effective common leadership and using modern equipment. However, there is, of course, also room for a certain amount of parliamentary scrutiny and control by the European Parliament. As someone who both speaks and listens, we are glad to see you as a frequent guest both here in plenary and in the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy. Finally, I should like to join you in expressing my pleasure at the incredible unity and speed with which this new form of cooperation is being set in motion. Yesterday, a few of us met the Portuguese Defence Minister. He was just as pleased and pleasantly surprised as yourself at the fact that it had been possible to agree about so much. Bear in mind that there are also non-aligned countries at the negotiating table. We share your delight, as long as we do not race ahead so quickly that transatlantic cooperation is impaired. There is one thing I shall again finally emphasise: that the purpose of all this is, of course, that we should acquire such credibility when we exercise economic and military pressure that military force is not used at all. That is the purpose of all this, and it is therefore also important that you should cooperate with Mr Patten, for it is military, economic and diplomatic pressure which together will put a stop to atrocities in neighbouring countries. Mr President, Mr Solana, we are all behaving like children. You are building castles in the air and your route map up to the year 2003 calls for 60 000 soldiers. It is extraordinary what decisions we took in Sintra concerning 2004, 2005, 2006. But what about Kosovo in the year 2000? You have spoken to Mr Gil-Robles. I have received an e-mail from a former colleague, Pierre Pradier, who is in Pristina at the moment. He tells the story of a Serbian doctor who has just been murdered in Pristina. He treated Roma, Albanians and Serbs and that is something unforgivable in Kosovo. A man with three children and he was murdered. We need policemen in Kosovo right now! We need soldiers who do not have a doctrine to put into practice.	fr
Instead, there is a need for proper internal control and the ability to sack people more easily. We should alter the staff regulations and disciplinary procedures and, especially, change our practice. At the moment, Article 52 of the staff regulations concerning dismissal on the grounds of gross negligence is never used. Should we not make a point of cleaning up our own act and putting our own house in order before we plunge into constructing grand new institutions! Mr President, we all want to do something about combating European fraud. But the question is now: is the European Union doing anything about it as well? The answer to this is that we know very little about this. The Tampere Summit was about combating crime. Everyone was supposedly pleased about it but, in reality, we have made little progress. There is no European anti-fraud legislation in force because the Member States, as was stated before, have not ratified the treaty texts submitted. So a great deal has to be done in this area. And what exactly should be done? Two things, and Mrs Theato' s report clearly spells these out. Firstly, the same penalty clauses regarding European fraud must apply in all Member States of the European Union. So, unification in this small area. Secondly, we should indeed set up a European Public Prosecutor' s Office with two tasks, firstly to assist the national public prosecutors, helping bring criminal proceedings in European fraud cases and, secondly, to supervise Europol and OLAF in a judicial sense because these are two criminal investigation services which can operate at the moment without any judicial supervision. The European Public Prosecutor' s Office is nothing to be afraid of. I feel there is a lot of scaremongering going on. It is, in fact, something very positive. Just like Europol. Europol, involving police cooperation, does not rank above the national police forces, but is there for the purpose of exchanging information between police forces. This is exactly the task which a small, limited, European Public Prosecutor' s Office should carry out, not just at the criminal investigation stage, but also at the prosecution stage. Parliament supports this. The Committee of Wise Men supports this. I urge the Council of Ministers and the European Commission to do the same. Mr President, I want to concentrate on the issue of corpus juris. I would very much like to support what Mrs Morgan said on this issue. Corpus juris is something that was set up without any kind of public debate or public participation. The idea of a European Public Prosecutor on the continental inquisitorial model with overriding jurisdiction throughout EU territories would have a major impact on the traditional systems both in Ireland and the UK. The idea of a single criminal code and the European Public Prosecutor is something which Member States have a right to be informed about. Indeed when the plan was initially drawn up they said it would be restricted to cases of fraud against the EU budget. But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity. We need a public debate on this. We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed. The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed.	de
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution. If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. (The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid. Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died. On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts. Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez. We had heard about this regrettable incident. Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish. (The Minutes were approved) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000. Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy. Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans. Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least. I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families. Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment. Agenda The next item is the order of business. Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government. If you decide to add this debate to the agenda, it will be introduced by speeches from Mr Seixas da Costa, President-in-Office of the Council, and Mr Romano Prodi, President of the Commission. Is there anyone who wishes to speak in favour of this proposal? Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form. Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure. This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent. We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it. (Applause) Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal?	de
That foundation is clearly the single market. How strongly is the single market established at the moment? I want to remind Mr Prodi, and his colleagues who are still here, of the findings of the Commission' s own survey among 3000 European businesses. Nearly 40% of businesses in this survey are still reporting additional costs to render products or services compatible with national specifications. This is the Commission' s own survey. These are the classic symptoms of continued obstruction by national governments - bureaucratic red-tape blocking market entry. The Commission' s programme shows a disturbing complacency about the completion of the internal market. We have to keep the pressure up in all areas by removing further barriers, intensifying pressure on Member States who fail to implement single market measures and, of course, extending into crucial new areas like financial services. Only on the strong foundation of the single market will the agenda of enlargement be successfully achieved. An enlarged Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union. The single market extending across that enlarged Union is going to be a colossal achievement. I conclude by saying, on behalf of all my Conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this Parliament - that we pledge our full support to the Commission and to Mr Prodi in achieving this historic task. Madam President, Mr Prodi, ladies and gentlemen, at the time of our vote on your appointment we invited you to come here today. The serious business is therefore now going to start as we are to vote on your programme. From your speech I will concentrate on what you have called the new governance, which you will use as a tool for reconciliation with our fellow citizens. Yet this new governance simply means how the institutions and our public authorities operate, if we agree that the European Union must be a public authority. The interlinking of the EU institutions, the responsibilities of the Member States and the local and regional authorities is all very well. Yet is this really how we will reconcile the people and European construction? Is this really how we will answer the fundamental questions which are not so much about 'who does what' but more 'what are we doing together' ? It is these questions which cause concern among our fellow citizens. In your speech you mentioned the challenges of globalisation and enlargement which await us. I would add to these the future of our social model. This is why I and my group are so firmly insisting on the Charter of Fundamental Rights. The reason our timetable includes the drafting of this Charter is because we are at a key point in our history. Our Union needs to redefine the values on which it is based, both within its current borders and also with a view to the imminent enlargements which we earnestly desire, but not under just any conditions. Our people expect more Europe, but not just any Europe.	es
The unease is justified. It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied. The Commission sympathises with these considerations. In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows. As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines. Consequently, the Commission has asked for the advice of a group of experts regarding the entirety of the reforms which could be implemented in order to enable the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance to maintain the quality and coherence of their administration of justice in forthcoming decades. The Commission is aware of the request made by the Court of First Instance to increase its number of judges, but at the moment, the former is of the opinion that the proposed transfer of competence should be seen in the light of the study which I have just mentioned. In other words, once this study is complete, the Commission will issue its opinion as soon as possible. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. Exceptional financial aid to Kosovo The next item is the report (A5-0022/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council decision providing exceptional Community financial assistance to Kosovo (COM(99)0598 - C5-0045/00 - 1999/0240(CNS)). I have been informed that the rapporteur has been delayed for several minutes. I propose that we start the debate immediately. He will join us and speak as soon as he arrives. I therefore give the floor immediately to Mr Bourlanges, in his capacity as draftsman of the opinion of the Committee on Budgets. Mr President, this is an important and urgent matter, and Parliament is complying with a request from the Commission to come to a decision quickly, because today, you must realise, men and women are dying in Kosovo quite simply because the temperature is 25 degrees below zero, these people are doing a great deal of work to ensure a minimum of maintenance and they have not been paid. An urgent request has been referred to us, and we approve it. We have been asked for EUR 35 million. We agree that it may be granted and we call on the Commission to be extremely vigilant in ensuring, once the decision has been taken, that the amounts are set aside and paid as quickly as possible. We are talking about macrofinancial aid. There are reactions to this in some quarters since it does not comply with the liberal canons of beauty which stipulate that there must be no financial intervention in order support an administration. This is not our opinion. Our opinion is that it is vital to contribute to setting up an administration in Kosovo and that it is by no means absurd to contribute directly to the payment of public employees in this region. Indeed that is something extremely useful that we could have done in Russia throughout the 1990s to prevent the disintegration of that state. The second important problem is that we have been asked for payments, the donors have made commitments and, obviously, we are the only ones actually paying. The other parties are not paying.	it
Quite the reverse, in fact. The Council' s proposal must comply with legislation of the national Member States in the field of criminal law. The wish to reach a unanimous decision can lead to compromises which do not stand this test. Careful parliamentary scrutiny by the European Parliament but, above all, by the national parliaments, is therefore of key importance. Mr Di Pietro' s proposal to omit the current Article 18 regarding intercepting telecommunications, amongst other things, is understandable, although very strict. The text of Article 18 is ambiguous: he is restricting the activities of the intelligence services but seems to allow interception activities by a Member State in another Member State without the latter' s prior authorisation. In this way, Member States would make themselves very vulnerable and it is doubtful as to whether there are sufficient guarantees to protect the State where interception occurs and the citizens within that State. Proposed additions, such as repeated references to the ECHR, the rights of the counsel for the defence and of the defendant and the failure of Member States to implement the ECHR, add too much unnecessary information to the text of the agreement. I am aware of the problems but I think that these could have been clarified by means of one single change in the text. The Dutch Members of the Group for a Europe of Democracies and Diversities will, however, despite hesitation, not withhold their support for the Di Pietro report in the final vote. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, this report is very important not only in terms of its content but also because it represents an initial step towards the establishment of better relations in judicial cooperation. This clearly only applies to relations at national level as nothing is mentioned about the much-discussed European citizenship. On one hand judicial measures fall outside the Community dimension yet on the other we have the free movement of people from which criminals are also benefiting. Pursuant to Article 29 of the EU Treaty, the Union' s objective is 'to provide citizens with a high level of safety within an area of freedom, security and justice by developing common action among the Member States in the fields of police and judicial cooperation in criminal matters and by preventing and combating racism and xenophobia' . The creation of Europol represents one step towards achieving this objective. However, we must take the next step, which is to reinforce judicial cooperation in criminal matters in order to gradually establish a genuine European judicial area consistent with the objective of creating an area of freedom, security and justice. This draft convention therefore aims to complete and facilitate the application, at Member State level, of pre-existing conventions on other legal areas. The intention is to improve judicial cooperation in criminal matters through rapid and effective legal assistance while still fully respecting the fundamental rights of the defence and the general principles of human rights enshrined in the national law of the Member States and in the European Convention on Human Rights. It is this concern for basic rights, freedoms and guarantees which has led us to support the deletion from the text of the phone tapping proposals. We recommend that the Council prepare a separate legal instrument to resolve this issue.	de
Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you. The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244. Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region. It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos. Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo? If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania? Since the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses. Question No 8 by (H-0796/99): Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy. However, housing is specifically excluded. Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG? Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas. I would like to point out that in May 1999 we adopted a new system for supporting rural development which was the fourth Community reference framework for sustainable rural development. This was, as you know, one of the changes made during the Agenda 2000 negotiations and it changes the way in which agricultural issues are dealt with at Community level. Through the European Agricultural Guarantee and Guidance Fund, the EAGGF, this Community support framework is designed to help reverse the trend of abandoning rural areas, an issue you are quite right to raise. On the other hand, the European Regional Development Fund, the ERDF, also contributes as part of its role to promoting social and economic cohesion, by redressing the main regional imbalances and encouraging rural areas to take part in development and conversion. In this regard, we should bear in mind that the ERDF also contributes to promoting sustainable rural development and to creating sustainable employment in rural areas. This combination of instruments enables us to implement a policy of rural development which today, furthermore, is one of the ways in which the common agricultural policy - in one of its dimensions - and regional policy also, have developed and changed.	de
"I say it again, the European Union' s cooperation and development policy is not coherent. and on behalf of the Green Group I call on Parliament, the institutions and the Commission to make a joint effort, at long last, to put some coherence into our policy. Mr President, I feel that this debate is particularly timely and appropriate, not just because development is in general an important issue, but because it is also a topical one. Seattle was a failure, and north-south relations were in the spotlight for all the wrong reasons. The meeting held in that North American city demonstrated that globalisation is having seriously unbalanced and negative effects on poorer countries. The Tenth United Nations Conference on Trade and Development is being held right now in Bangkok, and is suffering the consequences of that failure. In the meantime, however, as has already been mentioned, the negotiations on the future of the Lomé Convention have been concluded. This goes to show just how topical this subject is. We could also add to the list the next EU-OAU summit which it has finally been agreed to hold in Cairo in April. However, I would also like to add that any analysis, no matter how superficial, inevitably leads us to the conclusion that something - or even a great deal - is amiss with north-south relations, including those between the European Union and the less developed countries. You only have to realise that the category of ""least developed countries"" has grown from 25 to 48 countries over the last 30 years, and now represents 13% of the world' s population, yet this category only accounts for 0.4% of world exports and 0.6% of world imports or be aware of the unfortunate fact that official development aid from rich countries has fallen by around 23% since 1990. Furthermore, the recent Community budget cuts in this area, for the present financial year, are part of this trend, as well as sending an undesirable and misguided political message. Michel Camdessus, a fair man who is still director of the International Monetary Fund, said in his speech at the opening of the UNCTAD conference, and I am now quoting, that the international community gives with one hand and takes away with the other. He was of course talking about the aid granted by developed countries to less developed countries. It may seem ironic that this statement should come from someone in his position, but he did indeed say this, and I heard it with my own ears. This comment certainly seems to me to reflect the current situation, and I accordingly wish to stress that it is vital to rethink north-south relations and break the mould. In particular, we need to reconsider the role of the European Union in this area, as I am certain that one of the Union' s strategic objectives must be to promote a new and more equitable world order. It is therefore essential to review the present process of globalisation, bearing in mind the underlying approach and dominant interests on which it is based, and to consider the enormous and damaging effect that it is having on the less developed countries, particularly in this context."	es
Lastly, his proposal would not give any passport to management companies which do not want to render ISD activities. As regards the question put by Mr Huhne, his reference in the intervention he made this morning is to hedging operations. But hedging operations are already allowed in the existing Article 21(1) of Directive 611/85 on UCITS. So what Mr Huhne wants is already possible. A question has been put by Mrs Villiers who referred to enhancing portfolio management. That is also something which is allowed under present legislation. I refer to the same Article 21 I referred to in relation to Mr Huhne' s question. In her question Mrs Kauppi asks why the Commission has prepared a package of measures distributed in two separate proposals. The reason is that the first proposal focuses essentially on the product, while the second proposal focuses essentially on the service provider, and on prospectuses for UCITS. The separation of these two proposals which deal with two different sets of problems would facilitate the negotiating process in the Council. The Commission has not only to listen to Parliament and take into account parliamentary proposals but, as is well-known, must also deal with the Council. That is the reason why the Commission has put forward these two separate proposals. Lastly, Mr Balfe has complained that there are, in his opinion, too many limits in the whole proposal the Commission has put forward. It seems to us that these limits are justified: firstly, by the need to diversify investments; secondly, because of the vulnerability to the need to reimburse investment at any time; thirdly, in order to avoid an inordinate influence over the investment funds. These are the reasons why the Commission believes, because of the prudence that has to be exercised in this field, that these various limits are necessary. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 12 noon. Mutual assistance in criminal matters between the Member States The next item is the report (A5-0019/2000) by Mr Di Pietro on behalf of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms, and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs on the draft Council Act establishing the Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in letters dated 3 August 1999 and 3 December 1999, the Council called on the European Parliament, pursuant to Article 39 of the Treaty, to deliver its opinion on a draft convention between the Member States aimed at guaranteeing improved mutual assistance in criminal matters. It is thus, as you can see, a very important draft, that will effectively serve to provide the Member States of the Union with a more comprehensive and consistent instrument for mutual assistance. In actual fact, there are still certain differences of opinion within the Council over the type of convention, and over certain provisions contained therein. Some of these differences have already been ironed out, but others persist. The spirit of the proposal is nevertheless to equip those responsible for applying the law - primarily the judiciary, but also the citizens concerned - with a valid operational instrument to fight crime, which respects fundamental guarantees as regards defence and general principles of human rights.	it
This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death. It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution. What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased. For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances. I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way. I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men. What about women? Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard. There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk. There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen. For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission. Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy. Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community. This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur. There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster. And people have spoken in the past about BSE. For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed. Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money. So it also has to do with environmental protection. The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health. I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening.	de
The first is the harmonisation of national development policies and regional development policies. Subsidies are not enough to ensure development when infrastructure and public services are lacking. We must ask ourselves a fundamental question: how can we ensure that Union policy interfaces with the subsidiary national policies for regional development? The second challenge is that of enlargement which will, of course, have a considerable impact, both in budgetary and geographical terms. These are two areas of action which I invite the Commissioner to set up and in which I would ask him to involve us. Finally, in this time of natural disasters, I would just like to mention the issue of the use of Structural Funds. As you know, it is up to each State to redistribute part of the total appropriation. Europe should not be completely absent, as the states tend to want. Public opinion and the press nowadays accuse us of being unavailable to give a response, even though we are going to be funding a large proportion of the national operations. I think we should be capable of saying this loud and clear. I also think we should ensure, or ask Member States to ensure, that there is some publicity given to European aid whenever it is used to repair damage caused by natural disasters or accidents. Mr President, the priority given to financial and monetary criteria reinforces the increase in inequalities of every shape and form. As far as French planning experts are concerned, for example, the most probable scenario today is that of the entrenchment of regional disparities within each country. Well, the Structural Funds have helped to apply a brake to this process. Our project of a Europe that aims to satisfy social needs envisages the convergence of living conditions towards the highest common denominator. Its implementation would certainly require extending the scope of redistribution instruments such as the Structural Funds. What we are proposing specifically is a unified capital tax, which would make it possible to boost the funds used to support the harmonisation of social protection systems and the reduction of working hours at European level. The Commission, however, though bound to issue guidelines, does so only reluctantly and in a vague manner. The report put forward today re-establishes its place in the political sphere. It is one of the steps towards a policy of employment and sustainable development. This is what persuades us to vote in favour of it. Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work. Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy. To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds. For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States.	fr
"Furthermore, the way in which this European Council is being prepared is a good illustration of this. Firstly, there is the seriousness and depth of the document presented in January. Then, there are the various preparatory conferences and the contributions that both business and union leaders are making towards this summit. In particular, there is the latest contribution to research that was made at the recent meeting which brought together Nobel Prize winners and Ministers for Science and Technology. This shows that the Portuguese Government is preparing for this Summit seriously and is paying a great deal of attention to its substance. However, we also support the initiative relating to the summit' s main objective, which has already been mentioned. We do so because for the first time, it is not only putting the issue of employment and social issues at the centre of the European debate but is once again suggesting that ""achieving the objective of full employment"" is in the realm of the possible. For years, many people have said this was impossible, that in modern society it would never again be possible. My congratulations, Mr President-in-Office, for making this issue topical once again without rejecting social cohesion and values which we hold to be fundamental, because they are not only at the heart of the founding project of the EU, but they are at the heart of our civilisation and, above all, of our understanding of the need for solidarity between all Europeans. Something that we said here in January and that I would like to repeat is that we must not be satisfied with this strategic objective being the priority of one presidency, a priority for just six months. We challenge the Council and the Commission once again to include it, not as a priority for six months, but as a goal for the EU, as important as the goal of enlarging or deepening the European Union. Only in this way will it be able to match the degree of seriousness with which the presidency is preparing this Special Summit. I congratulate you, Mr President-in-Office. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, I should like to express my delight at the fact that a bullish agenda has been set for the issues of employment and economic development at the Lisbon Summit. It is an agenda which emphasises that it is a strong and dynamic economy and increased competitiveness which will secure the objective of higher employment in the EU. The fact that the EU lags so far behind the United States with regard to research, job creation and the development of new technology gives pause for thought. A joint effort is needed to strengthen research and development, including research in connection with information technology, and there is a need to strengthen the internal market and to create the necessary conditions for receiving the full benefits from the new technology and for developing trade via the Internet. It is right to focus upon access to, and use of, the Internet by public officials and by the education system and to create what has been called ""the learning society"" . It is also only right to concentrate upon access to venture capital and otherwise to reinforce the position of small and medium-sized businesses."	es
We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today. Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world. In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values. We know from our own experience that freedom and the ability to decide are not given freely but must be fought for. Let us continue to fight and ensure that this century brings us victory: not over men, not over anyone, but the victory of equality between men and women. We therefore cannot afford to miss any more opportunities, and the great challenge confronting all Europeans now, and particularly women, concerns the new economy and the new information technologies. The Lisbon Summit to be held at the end of this month is very much geared towards women. The rate of employment in Europe, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan, must be increased. We must therefore have many more women in work, and working in the new jobs in which the EU has a shortfall. I would therefore like to ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they will be presenting at the forthcoming Lisbon Summit to ensure that the new economy and the new Europe we want to build will definitely include equality between men and women. Mr President, Commissioner, the reason why I was so pleased with your intervention was that you had the courage to list the Member States where the political representation of women is a success, such as, for example, in Finland, France and Sweden, and equally, you had the courage to list the Member States where things in this respect are not going so well, such as, for example, my own country and Greece too, which you forgot to mention. Moreover, I have heard that for the next elections, it appears that very few women will feature on the electoral lists in Greece. I think this is a very sad state of affairs. I appreciate your courage because I think that it is high time that we in the European institutions started to offer concrete instruments to help put more women on the political agenda. This is why I think it is important that this Parliament continues to press for quotas and that this is openly included in the resolution. I myself, Commissioner, am a product of quotas. I do not believe that any of the MEPs will be able to prove that I am any less competent as a result. It appears that the meritocracy in a number of our European countries is still so biased in favour of males that women simply do not stand a chance.	fr
Between 1998 and 1999, loyalists assaulted and shot 123 people, while republicans assaulted and shot 93 people. Charges brought against loyalists in 1999 totalled 193, while those against republicans totalled 97. Since January 2000, there have been six shootings by loyalists and two by republicans, loyalists have been involved in six serious assaults, one leading to another murder, while republicans have engaged in five serious assaults. Mr President, that situation cannot continue and needs remedying. Mr President, the Treaty of Amsterdam has set an important objective for the Union. This is a task which all MEPs, the Council and the Commission must take on during this legislature: the creation, as has been said already, of an area of freedom, security and justice. The Tampere Council, the motor and architect of this objective, has proposed certain goals, but five years, the time scale laid down for the implementation of Chapter IV of the Treaty, is too long to wait for the urgent solution which some problems require. My first point is that Parliament must not be excluded from the important decisions to be taken in this area and that its participation in the decision-making process must be guaranteed, especially with regard to this project which affects the citizens, as the Commissioner has explained very well. My second point is that we must make rapid progress in the adoption of a common asylum system, adopting common procedural rules and, above all, putting an end to the current confusion between migration for political reasons and migration for economic reasons. The recent laws on aliens adopted in my country, Spain, and in Belgium, are a reminder that there is an urgent need for the communitisation of immigration policy. My third and final point relates to the external activities of the Union in the field of immigration and asylum. We must not and cannot give the impression that the Union exclusively wishes to defend itself from an avalanche of refugees and economic migrants. We must opt for a policy of cooperating in the development of our neighbouring countries in the East and the Mediterranean area, but we must do so with rigour, with economic means and in close collaboration with public institutions, which must cooperate in the protection of those citizens whose most basic rights are violated or who wish to emigrate in order to meet their most essential needs. Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship. The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough. They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said. Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino. This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said. As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated. Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months.	fr
This phenomenon is particularly marked in France: the GNP of the Champagne-Ardennes region, which it is my honour to represent, has gone from 105% to 94% of the Community average, that of the Loire region has dropped from 95% to 91%, and that of the Auvergne from 89% to 83%. This is a generalised tendency, sparing neither the Rhône-Alpes, nor Alsace. It has been confirmed in Sweden and Finland, countries where unemployment has in fact increased to a worrying degree over the last few years, as in many regions of the United Kingdom. It may therefore seem strange that, when the Structural Funds were reformed, Objective 2, dedicated to industrial and rural areas undergoing economic restructuring, should have been sacrificed in favour of Objectives 1 and 3. For the period 1999-2006, the total appropriation for this Objective will be ECU 22.5 billion, a figure more or less identical to that for the period 1994-1999. The rural regions eligible under Objective 5b will be included among the main victims of this situation: in France, 27% of the populations eligible for Structural Funds are going to lose their eligibility at the end of the transition period, a figure which is occasionally much larger in some regions such as the Loire region, Alsace or Lower Normandy, political strongholds of the right-wing that were the victims of the petty political vote chasing of the left-wing coalition government. Based as it is on such choices, it is to be doubted whether regional policy can contribute to harmonious regional planning within the Member States of the European Union. von Wogau Report (A5-0069/1999) . (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration. As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today. The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries. This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996. It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened. It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration. Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained. . (PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system. The position that has now been adopted aims to create more rapid ways of applying competition policy, moving towards applying Community law in national courts rather than at the European Court of Justice, and even aims at having specialised courts. This partial renationalisation of competition policy could involve higher costs for Member States. On the other hand, as the rapporteur points out, in the name of competition policy, public monopolies are often exchanged for private monopolies, with the privatisation of important industries and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with harmful consequences for the country and its workers.	de
In response to this the Commission has entered into various commitments and has certainly adopted many reform measures. It is fair to say that the new President, Mr Prodi, and his team are certainly committed to implementing the financial control requirements as laid down by this Parliament. However, the reform of the European Commission must now be taken in the context of the debate that is going to take place in the run-up to the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference and the reform of various EU policies and initiatives. Existing EU treaties will be amended so as to ensure, for example, that the enlargement process can succeed. I have no doubt further reform of EU institutions will be analysed in this debate. But from the perspective of small Member States it is important that, as the European Commission is reformed, it must be done in a way that ensures that small Member States continue to have representation on the Commission. Mr President, the Commission is now to obtain its discharge for 1997, but in reality it does not deserve it. 1997 was a matter for the old Commission and, therefore, the new Commission does not think that it can accept liability. It is true that implementation of the Budget for 1997 fell within the old Commission' s remit. The new Commission has, on the other hand, undertaken to carry out a cleaning up exercise following former scandals, and I must admit that I am not impressed at all. The old mindset which involved sweeping things under the carpet and protecting one' s friends unfortunately still exists. There are some who think that it is more in our interests to let bygones be bygones and make a fresh start. I do not, however, think we can make a fresh start if we do not tidy things up properly. I am referring here especially to the earlier scandals involving ECHO. I am very indignant about the fact that it is so difficult to get any documents handed over on this matter. I am the rapporteur for ECHO on the Committee on Budgetary Control, and I shall have a lot of difficulty carrying out my work if the Commission will not give me the necessary information. From the outside, it looks as if the Commission has something to hide. My investigations also unfortunately suggest that this could be the case. The Commission is not putting all its cards on the table and is in that way repeating ancient practice on the part of the Commission. It was this practice which led to the Commission' s downfall. I can therefore fully support the demand to give Parliament unconditional right of access to documents. Otherwise, we cannot carry out our work. Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Response to Second Report of Committee of Independent Experts The next item is the report (A5-0001/2000) by Mr van Hulten, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, on action to be taken on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts on reform of the Commission.	fr
Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries. I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation. Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link. These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote. The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him. The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account. There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology. This is a highly controversial issue as it constitutes a potential source of abuse. It could be maintained that in overall terms the legislation proposed is better than nothing, but to the Commission it nevertheless appeared insufficient and far from reassuring. It thus merits further reflection which, at a time in which the ambivalent reports on ECHELON are evoking shades of Big Brother, should probably go into greater detail on the means and methods to be used, on the one hand, to safeguard the rights of the individual, and on the other hand to facilitate an effective but at the same time correct and legitimate suppression of crime. The objective is thus to achieve, as closely as possible, a fine balance between the fight against organised crime and respect for personal freedoms and the dignity of the individual: an objective which now specifically applies not only to the Member States, but also to the Union, which is aspiring to become a common area of freedom, justice and security. This is a distant goal, but is one that can be attained in stages. The most important thing will be the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States, but for now let us content ourselves with this small step forward, as it is a step in the right direction. Mr President, first of all I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent explanatory statement. It points out some of the serious flaws in this proposal. The lack of clarity of language is inevitably going to lead to legal uncertainty. Legal certainty is something that is essential in such crucial matters. Because of shoddy drafting the Convention can be interpreted very widely, and it ignores the strict conditions which interception is supposed to be subject to under the European Convention on Human Rights. Article 18 allows interception in another Member State without its involvement. Not only should this be deleted, the whole interception title should be scrapped. An initiative of the FBI drew up the user requirements which form the basis of the current legislation. The Council proposal containing those requirements, ENFOPOL 98 was approved by this Parliament last May in the Schmid report.	de
The fundamental question, it seems to me, that faces this Parliament, the Commission and the Council is: What is Europe? What does it mean and what does Europe give us over and above the parameters of our national boundaries? Europe is its people, its history and now its collectivity; but the reason why Culture 2000 is so important to us is for this: I will wager that when we ask the question - 'What is Europe?' - we answer it by saying, 'It is our art, it is our literature and it is our heritage.' That is what Culture 2000 represents. It represents the possibility of sustaining a European identity in the twenty-first century, an identity which eschews the echoes of division, of war, of poverty, of opportunity, of poverty dans la realité. And more than this - and this is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we have the ability to learn from previous policy initiatives by putting them into action in new programmes that are comprehensive, that are cross-cutting and that benefit our creative industries to the extent that they now require. It promotes mobility, and it opens the doors of culture to the socially disadvantaged and excluded. My only regret is that in promoting this programme we do not have sufficient money to match our aspirations and ensure our ability to deliver. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, we have now come to the end of a long road. Following the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new 'Culture 2000' framework programme. We shall thus, in the course of the next five years, have a tool perfectly suited to developing clear, well-structured and, I am sure, successful measures in order to promote the cultural sector. It is with great satisfaction that I today welcome this 'happy ending' in this House, and I thank you for it. I wish to thank everyone in this Parliament who worked to achieve this successful outcome to the conciliation process. I should like to express especial thanks to the Committee on Culture, Youth, Education, the Media and Sport, particularly to its rapporteur, Mr Graça Moura, its chairman, Mr Gargani, the European Parliament delegation and the leaders of the political groups, the Conciliation Committee and its chairman, Mr Imbeni. They all made a vital constructive and balanced contribution. Throughout the negotiations, they were of great help and it must be said that the difficult and occasionally tiresome negotiations were nonetheless completed in record time. We now have a framework programme, the first of its type for the cultural sector, and this programme makes it possible for us to plan our action from a new perspective and to work to promote culture in a more comprehensive, but also more thorough and detailed manner. I would like to express my delight, with you, at this pleasing outcome. In spite of a budget situation which does not match up to our ambitions, these results will now enable us to approach the future positively and I would like to pick up on what Mr Gargani has just said, that the Commission made a statement regarding a mid-term assessment.	es
It is, in fact, an international agreement and a trade agreement. Could I just finally express my great hopes for the peace process in that area - a part of the world that so desperately needs it - so that it can re-group and re-form and help its millions of under-privileged and poverty-stricken citizens. Mr President, it is universally recognised that rules must be observed. It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules. Everyone understands that there is concern about this today, but I would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable. Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment. Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel. And because the Commission' s investigation is not, and must not be perceived as, an indictment, I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach. Firstly, anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine, including joint ventures, Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters. Secondly, nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined. The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers. Any attempt on the part of the European Union to impose its own idea of the territorial limits of the State of Israel would be, at the very least, lacking in tact and detrimental to these talks and to the idea of the role which we feel Europe should have in this region. I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter, firstly because this is not a simple issue. It is complicated; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from. No less so in the Middle East because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between Israel and Palestinians, where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the Palestinian area and in the State of Israel and these developments are good things, they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the Middle East, then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement. Therefore, because it is not an easy and simple issue, we have to be cautious and we have to be careful. The second reason why the Commission is right to proceed in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a part in the area in securing peace then it must be seen to be fair and evenhanded. It would not be fair and evenhanded to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that it is meeting determine what the situation is, both in terms of the area of the State of Israel relating to the trade agreement and, as I say, in relation to the goods and where they come from at the same time.	es
We can no longer tolerate a situation where the general public has to foot the bill for damage that has often been caused by individuals involved in criminal machinations. We must make the perpetrators liable for all manner of damage done to our environment. Then, for example, people will think twice before transporting oil in a tanker that is about to fall apart. When, in 1994, over five years ago that is, I joined the Legal Affairs Committee in this Parliament, I became rapporteur for the environmental liability dossier. To this day I am still awaiting an initiative from the Commission, which will actually enable me to start work. It is a scandalous state of affairs that must be ended with all haste, and I hope that February does not see this dossier being postponed yet again! Mr President, Commissioner, the storms that took place at the turn of the millennium should galvanise us into thinking about certain problems. It has become clear that mankind continues to be unable to avoid natural disasters. There have always been natural disasters and there always will be. Of course, there is a need for solidarity here. There is certainly a need for European civil protection, and the EU budget must also provide for a budget line covering natural disasters. But, most importantly, it is only ever man that makes the mistakes as far as the nature-mankind relationship is concerned - despite the fact that the same mistakes have often been made down through the centuries - and never nature, for nature cannot make mistakes. The extent of the damage caused on this occasion was determined by the population density, the type of infrastructure, and, of course, the many monocultures, if we are talking forests. Of course, I am in favour of providing assistance where we can. But when it comes to aid, we ought to bear in mind that perhaps in future, more emphasis should be placed on laying electricity and telephone cabling underground. We must take account of smaller cycles and plant stable mixed woodland when undertaking reforestation, rather than monocultures. The most important subject for discussion in this context is the climate. To this day, we in Europe remain in the privileged position of having the Gulf Stream, and the Gulf Stream still does its stuff. America and south-east Asia are having a much worse time of it as far as climate and storms go. We are fortunate in having the Gulf Stream. But in common with others, we too are having to endure the greenhouse effect. This is partly the work of human hand, as difficult as it is to demonstrate climate change using calculations. We must take more account of the guidelines produced at the Kyoto environmental conference. We must reduce CO2 emissions, employ renewable energies, and generally make enquiries, in this connection, as to how the forests of Europe are faring. Mr President, I think we should firstly express our sorrow for the victims. This is an irreparable loss. Secondly, we welcome the solidarity between the French departments and citizens, and the solidarity of other countries with France, which is the country worst affected. As I have little time, Mr President, I would like to touch upon two elements of our resolution. I believe that the first one was implicitly recognised by the Commissioner in his speech when he wondered whether these catastrophes are natural or not.	it
"Moreover, regarding these small businesses, we will have to consider whether it would not be better to apply a system with a prior warning built in, the yellow card, instead of an immediate red card, which will be a large fine and will threaten the company' s very existence. Mr President, being the last to speak gives me the privilege, Commissioner, of telling you that the majority of this House supports your initiative and has expressed a total, and, I believe, justified, confidence in you at the helm of this boat. But we all want to be oarsmen on it. We all belong on the same boat and want to row with you. I therefore believe it to be absolutely necessary to establish an interinstitutional dialogue so that we might reach a good conclusion and put all the finishing touches to this essential reform. The many ideas which have been expressed here could be put into three broad categories. Firstly, there is the concern that some have expressed, in particular Mrs Randzio-Plath, President of the Committee on Economic Affairs, of whether this new system of legal exception is absolutely compatible with the Treaty. I share that concern and I believe that this issue should be addressed. Secondly, we have the issue of companies' legal certainty. It is true, Commissioner, that the Commission is not a machine for manufacturing legal certainty. We all agree on this. But it is nonetheless true - and this has been repeated from all sections of this House - that the European industrial fabric is composed of small and medium-sized businesses, and that the Commission often plays the role of auctoritas, of legitimising the nature of the internal market. On this point I will give my opinion on something which Mr Karas said. There have only been nine rejections. But here I would like to call on my experience as a lawyer. How often has a lawyer with two companies and one project, in the face of a Commission guideline given ex ante, changed that project in order for it to comply with the competition rules! This is therefore an aspect to be considered. Thirdly, we have the problem of the uniform application of Community law. In this respect, the excellent speech by Mrs Thyssen cannot be improved upon. I believe that biodiversity is good, as is cultural diversity, but not diversity in the application of the law with regard to the essential core of the internal market, that is to say, competition law. Here improvements should be made. Only in certain countries, Germany for example, is there specialised jurisdiction. Perhaps this is a promising avenue to explore, but we must also explore others. What we cannot do, Commissioner - and I would like to end on this note - is to give way, and give ammunition, to those who regard the European institutions as the property of the great and the good, of the rich, and not of the citizen, or the small and medium business, which, in the worst case scenario - which will never become reality because the requisite measures will be applied to prevent it - will result in courts which make disparate judgements, very late, with no real possibility of control apart from what the French call ""le parcours du combatant"", that is to say, after Lord knows how many years, when the Court in Luxembourg passes judgement, a Court which we know to be inundated at the moment."	it
The various references made to regional cooperation with the neighbouring countries in fact become politically relevant in this context. This agreement can and must become an example to the other countries in the region. That is why it is so important. The point is that underlying this whole process is an effective political will on the part of the European Union to draw closer to these countries. We are aware that some of them are already undergoing processes of democratic stabilisation, that others still need to affirm the democratic authority of their governments, and that equilibrium in others depends on the military presence in the zone, but they are all countries which now know that, once they have overcome their difficulties, a bridge is available to provide an effective link with the European Union. Mr President, Commissioner, I am not going to join in the unanimous chorus from my fellow Members. I think this report is a small masterpiece of hypocrisy. Paragraph 5 holds up this agreement as an example. We know there are 13 applicant countries, from Lithuania to Turkey, and just one black hole in Europe, the Balkans, but because these countries are denied the opportunity to become applicants, we want to make them believe that this agreement is a miracle. Paragraph 11 indicates that symbolic measures can replace the shared political outlook represented by applicant status. But this is not just a masterpiece of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, if negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years. And I defy you to imagine that there will not be membership applications in due form from Croatia, Macedonia and Bosnia, amongst the Balkan countries, three years hence. A few days ago Mr Racan announced that Croatia' s formal membership application would be presented at the end of 2000. There are bound to be other applications and this great work, this fine intellectual architecture, will crumble, left behind by events just as we have been left behind by everything that has been happening in the former Yugoslavia for the past 20 years. This would not be so serious if this region of Europe were not so beset by the problems we are all aware of, problems which are being addressed, but which have not yet been resolved, by the new government of Macedonia. There are the problems of coexistence between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority, the connected problems of Kosovo, the notorious economic problems, the problems of being neighbour to a particularly developed mafia in Serbia, and then there is the problem of the Greek veto which must be condemned for what it is. After nearly 10 years, Greece continues to prevent this country being called by its own name, and I hope the interpreters have not used the term FYROM when I have been saying Macedonia. It is absolutely absurd. Apart from anything else it is offensive, in my opinion, to the Greek MEPs and the citizens of Greece. This question needs to be resolved urgently. Finally, by happy chance, a letter from Mr Georgievski, President of Macedonia to Mr Fischler, dated 8 March, has come into my hands. In it, referring to Article O, now Article 49 of the Treaty, he asks if Macedonia can join the European Union.	it
"Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe. My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world. One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners. The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and ""national interests"" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions. We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia. By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account. But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position. It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister. Justice needs to be done in Indonesia. Justice needs to be done in East Timor. President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with. The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one. Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished. It is impossible to talk about East Timor without mentioning the tens of thousands of Timorese refugees living on Indonesian soil in inhumane conditions, under the control of Indonesian soldiers and militias, and being used as bargaining chips. This is an intolerable situation which must cease as a matter of urgency. . (PT) Mr President, I would like to make a few very brief comments on behalf of the Council presidency, and first to remind you that the work done by the presidency is above all about coordination and about seeking common positions on initiatives that the fifteen Member States are to approve in the Council. Our experience of previous sessions of the Human Rights Commission suggests - precisely by virtue of this coordinating role played by successive presidencies - that the European Union is very much able to uphold its status as a body with its own policy within the Commission, and it is important to maintain this. I would also like to say that the European Parliament' s participation in the preparatory work is important in establishing coherent European Union positions on various different issues, and that the presidency therefore naturally welcomes all the various suggestions and in particular all the contributions made through the resolutions which have been presented."	es
We therefore ask the European Commission for special measures and to adopt the principle of equal opportunities in all tourism programmes and programmes for company development. Mr President, I would like to begin with some words of optimism, which came to us in the form of the High-Level Group communication of October 1998, the first page of which said that by the end of the next decade, it would be possible to create between 2 200 000 e 3 300 000 new jobs in tourism activities in the Union. In addition, it said that this would only happen if the right conditions were created. The Commission and Parliament are called upon to answer two questions: what are the right conditions and what is the role of the European Union on this? The Commission and Parliament can help us understand, in the first place, exactly what we are dealing with, because even the term 'tourism' , as was, moreover, pointed out in the Viceconte report, is still an ambiguous term, a kind of variable that depends on latitude, climate, a range of opportunities, and a series of background factors; it can be synonymous with holidays or it can be a true area of production, income, wealth and employment. There is a shortage of facts: we have no information on the economic impact, which still remains a complete mystery. We have criteria for the gathering and interpretation of statistics which are totally at odds with each other, despite what was said in a 1995 directive by the Commission and Parliament. With the aim of working out a strategy, it is vital to have a reading of these facts which harmonious and as strict as possible, so that we truly make tourism capable of creating jobs. This does not follow automatically: often in the past a great deal of wealth has been accumulated thanks to the promotion of the tourist industry, without this being matched by an increase in employment. There is no legal basis, and we feel that this is currently the major obstacle to any intervention in the tourism sector. A legal basis translates into the ability to formulate strategies, to coordinate and to programme, all vital factors for making European Union tourism competitive with other markets. A legal basis would mean we would avoid having to draw on the Structural Funds, as was the case in the past, to obtain some loose change. Moreover, only minimal amounts were made available to us: we should bear in mind that the Commission communication indicated amounts totalling EUR 4 700 000 000 over the last five years, which corresponds to the cost of building 400 kilometres of motorway. There is no opportunity to send a strong message to the Member States: recognising the legal basis of tourism would allow the States to acknowledge one of the European Union' s competences which at the moment, is only exercised in fits and starts. We fully endorse the Community measures which were recommended in the Commission communication: advantageous taxation, that is, fiscal measures that offer conditions that are truly competitive in this market to the production sector - 95% of which, I would point out, is made up of small and medium-sized businesses, which is equivalent to 2 million small and medium-sized businesses in the European tourism sector; it awards special attention to vocational qualifications in the European Union, and therefore to investing in training; finally, it undertakes to make the job market transparent.	it
I feel that these parameters - particularly those of a qualitative nature, resulting from investments in continuous training, refresher courses, adaptability and retraining of older workers - are considerably more significant and binding owing to their lasting effects over the medium term than the simple drawing up of annual quantitative objectives, that are always debatable, regarding new employment or employment cuts. If, among other things, as the programme of the Portuguese Presidency stresses as well, the Commission could promote a new phase of social dialogue, focusing on an agreed strategy of socialisation and diffusion of knowledge, in other words, a strategy for employability and the definition of its rules, this would allow us to take a step towards having employees participate in the informed and consensual management of the restructuring and reemployment processes. Thirdly, I do not think that the decrease in the number of the working population, owing to the ageing of the population, is unavoidable and inevitable for the European Union. This is not just because of the existence of margins which would permit an increase in the number of working women and immigration, but because we need to be determined in reversing the widespread trend of early retirements from the job market, and direct the coordinated reform of social welfare systems, certainly not towards large reductions in future pension payments but towards the active use of people' s increased life expectancy and towards a longer working life. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, you have come here today, Mr Prodi, in a very reformist and ambitious mood. I welcome you and your ambition. Ambition will be needed, given the mammoth task which awaits us. In order to make these reforms, however, and in order to make progress with the 2001 legislative programme, we must be very sure, not only of the strengths of the reformer himself, but also of the opinions of others. You say that you will not hesitate to come to this House to request more resources for the Commission, but the Commission must be aware that we are walking on thin financial ice. We have 1.27% of the Community' s GDP. Not a euro more or a euro less. It will not be us who refuse these new resources. You should ask the Council. These financial perspectives are adjusted to within a millimetre. In order to finance the stability plan for the Balkans, we will have to negotiate a significant revision of Category 4, and you must remember the enormous difficulties we have had in approving the 2000 budget. I would remind you that this Group, the PPE-DE, does not like to finance new political initiatives at the expense of existing ones. The political priorities must be set by this House and the MEPs. Do not believe for one moment that your proposed reform of the budget will disguise the limitations of the Community financial system. It is all very well for us, by mutual consensus, to make an effort in terms of budgetary rationalisation, but you must be very aware that the lack of resources, the absence of financial autonomy and the poor execution of the budget, continue to be urgent issues which must be resolved. We therefore wonder whether the Commission has the political will to resolve them. Madam President, the Commission communication is well written but sufficiently vague to allow any interpretation whatsoever.	de
This is patently not the case, since such a quota would not be realistic. Indeed the report does not mention the time limit for this quota to be achieved. To set my fellow Members' minds at ease and to reassure them, I have tabled an amendment to the resolution in which we simply take note of the fact that the Commission, in its communication, undertakes to make significant efforts to increase women' s participation in Community research programmes, which is, after all, a praiseworthy goal. And why should we not note that the Commission' s communication stipulates specifically that it considers a 40% minimum level to be a crucial goal for women' s participation at all levels in the implementation and management of research programmes? It is not a quota! It is a perfectly legitimate declaration of intent from the Commission, insofar as it concerns its own programmes and not those of Member States. The latter would be well advised, however, to follow the good example of the Commission, for once, and make the same efforts in their own research programmes. People must realise this! I am pleased to see that the debate on Mrs McNally' s report with a view to increasing and facilitating women' s participation in professions in research and science, met with a fairly wide consensus. On this subject, any improvement in bringing the concept of equal opportunities to bear in everyday reality is indeed desirable, and I can only welcome the implementation of a policy which would contribute towards satisfying the legitimate aspirations of women: to enjoy equal access to scientific study, to obtain positions of responsibility truly in line with their results and competence, and to have accompanying measures drawn up rapidly, enabling them to reconcile their family life and their career. This necessary realistic and pragmatic policy, however, which will have to be associated with the elimination of the practical obstacles identified as unquestionable factors in this inequality must, as far as we are concerned, necessarily be based on the idea of complementarity, which is the only one capable of justifying a proactive policy on the subject. Our thinking and our future actions must focus on respecting these values, which truly respect gender differences, not on some postulated sexual equality, which has its own intrinsic contradictions. In any event there are no grounds for resorting to the easy option of a quantitative policy, based on the use of quotas, contrary to the idea of citizenship which the Members of Parliament in the UEN Group set great store by, and whose probable consequences would be the opposite of the effect apparently sought by Mrs McNally' s report, namely women' s participation in careers in science and research in proportion with their merit. By having the opportunity to show their true merit, by eliminating as far as possible the barriers associated to the specifics of their condition as women, and not in the context of a conflict in which women seem to be attacking male privilege, women will demonstrate the benefits to be gained by facilitating a situation where their professional careers may flourish. In this way they will succeed in altering balances which are still not in their favour.	es
My second question is of a more technical nature, but it is important for the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Western European Union to be transferred to the European Union as harmoniously as possible. You have told us, in this regard, that three committees are being set up, a political committee and a security committee, which started up today, and a military committee. You then spoke of their relations with the third country members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of the Western European Union but which are not members of the European Union. In the operation of the temporary institutions, whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr Solana, what status you intend to confer on the members of the Alliance and on the associate States of the WEU which, I repeat, are not yet members of the European Union? Could they, for example, have a place, at least as observers, in the different political and security committees or in the military committee? You know that they are concerned about the risk of being isolated and I should like to say that I understand their wish to participate with you in bringing this to a successful conclusion. Mr President, Secretary-General, as you can tell, the Members of this House have listened with great interest to your information on the result of the Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers in Sintra and its significance in the European integration process in terms of security and defence. Thank you too for sharing with us your telephone conversation with Mr Gil-Robles. However, in terms of foreign policy, I am not sure whether we can advance at the rate needed to meet requirements, as some Members have said this afternoon, without ignoring the problems which you are coming up against. I will give you an example. During the recent trip by the President of the European Parliament to the Middle East, which you mentioned, the various conflicting parties were in agreement about asking for a more active presence from the European Union in the on-going peace process in the region. Do you believe that representatives of Community institutions and Member State governments are acting with the coordination and balance required of those who, like us, hope to mediate between two opposing parties? This House is rather doubtful about this and I am not sure whether you share this doubt. In this respect, as you will know, the European Parliament is working on an initiative to form a common diplomatic corps of the Community. This is clearly not intended to replace the diplomatic services of the Member States but to complement these and possibly improve their coordination. Could you give us an initial reaction to this initiative, without compromising the more detailed reaction which you may be able to give us in the Foreign Affairs Committee? Mr Solana, it has been said many times in this House that prevention is better than cure. Of course it is, but there is no reason why Europe cannot equip itself with the means to intervene when prevention proves unsuccessful.	es
What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation. How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area? Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area? The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member. The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan. The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive. That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive. Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed. After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour. An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out. The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats. At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded. Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved. However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute. Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements. They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts. However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint. In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended. However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts.	fr
Since there is often overlap between the two legal angles and cross-border violations against the Union budget are on the increase - they are also committed by those involved in organised crime - it is unclear as to where the responsibility lies amongst the Member States. Then there are differences between the national legal requirements of the individual Member States, together with protracted or even unfulfilled requests for mutual assistance in law enforcement. What is more, the agreement on the protection of financial interests and the two subsequent protocols signed by the European Council in 1995 did nothing to change this. For it to enter into force, it must be ratified by all 15 Member States. After five years only four have done so. This state of deadlock, which threatens to undermine the credibility of the Union, has inspired Parliament to initiate the setting-up of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office. There is no intention whatsoever to create a transnational criminal law and judicial authority, rather the aim is to equip the Union with specific instruments for the protection of its financial interests, that is whilst upholding the principle of subsidiarity. We are giving new life to this idea with this report and call upon the Commission to present legislative proposals that will enable this goal to be realised. The concerns of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as articulated in its position, together with those of the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs, will also be taken full account of in this process. We would like to make two recommendations arising from the establishment of OLAF and which should safeguard its operational and legal efficiency, transparency, and the protection of the rights of individuals. In addition, we need - and this is my first recommendation - a legislative act that includes those offences which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and in which main principles are firmly established. I support the proposed deadline for the Commission being 30 September in a proposed amendment. The second recommendation relates to criminal proceedings. The Commission ought - and I have also amended this deadline to 31 May 2000 - to propose a legislative act on the establishment of an independent body which has institutional links with the Commission, for coordinating and supervising the legal investigative body OLAF. The existing monitoring committee can only monitor the independence of the Director of the agency. The proposal for a legislative act of this kind should contain an independent statute for this body and define its tasks, which are confined to inquiries and criminal prosecution undertaken by OLAF into activities which are to the detriment of the Union' s financial interests, and to OLAF' s relationship with the national authorities. There is no question of this influencing the administration of justice in the Member States. The Court of Justice is to monitor the legality of the legislative acts. In addition, we call upon the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference to take up debate on the establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office for the protection of the financial interests of the Union, where possible on the basis of the now widely recognised study compiled by well-known experts, the so-called corpus juris, and of the feasibility studies that have subsequently appeared. Further support for this proposal is also to be found in the second report of the so-called Five Wise Men. The Commission, Mr Barnier, Mr Vitorino and several Member States are equally receptive to the idea. I call upon you, ladies and gentlemen, to vote in favour of this report, which the Committee on Budgetary Control adopted with a large majority. We can set another example here, to the effect that Parliament is taking action to prevent mismanagement and in particular, fraud, and to mete out punishment where necessary. Mr President, I am happy to take the floor in the debate on this report and I congratulate Mrs Theato.	de
Who would want this to happen? Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics? Europe is a community of law. Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold. One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did. It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty. It would be politically astute not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it as an undeniably democratic, constitutional and well-known European party, so as to be equally certain that Austria will continue to be a Member of this European Community, and that is why we must give the ÖVP our support in this difficult situation, and isolation would be altogether the wrong line to take! (Applause) Madam President, they say, where I come from, 'it' s three times for a Welshman' , and three times, as I think you will discover in the course of that debate, I signified my desire to respond very briefly to what has been an excellent, and on several occasions, a moving debate. First of all, could I express my thanks on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission for the support and understanding offered by several Members of the House to the position taken by the Commission in the statement that we made yesterday. I must respond also to the fact, of course, that there were references during the debate - and I use some of the words employed - to the ambiguity, the complacency and the fragility of the Commission' s opinion. I am duty- bound to say to this House, there is no ambiguity or fragility or complacency in the opinion offered, or indeed the action taken, by the Commission on this issue. We made explicit reference yesterday morning in our statement, as did the President this afternoon, to the fact that we share the concern demonstrated by fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday. Secondly, we said, in very specific terms, that we will work closely with all Member States in examining the situation as it develops in Austria. Thirdly, we expressed, in very explicit terms, that we will uphold without fear or favour the values and the provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty; and that we will take our part under Article 7 of the Treaty in ensuring that those values of liberty and democracy and fundamental freedoms are upheld. There is no complacency, no fragility and no ambiguity about any of that at all. And, when I say that the Commission took that view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria; and who, once again, demonstrated his integrity and his independence as a Member of the European Commission, under oath, in being part of that statement that we made yesterday morning.	it
However, shifting the tax burden from labour to the use of raw materials and minerals is precisely what we need by way of a lasting contribution. Mr President, first of all, I would like to congratulate my colleague Giorgos Katiforis on the report he presented to us. Not the report he presented to us here today, but the one he presented to the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, because politically speaking, these are two completely different reports. In very general terms, we could call the first report a left-wing one, as it addresses social issues as well as economic ones. The report we have before us now and which Mr Katiforis is reluctant to defend - and I think that he is right in this - is a hybrid report, from which the main conclusions have been removed, and is based on social concerns. What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report? He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve. And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets. Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%? An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment. We therefore need to augment our rate of employment with jobs that are competitive. As has been advocated for the Lisbon Summit, we must prepare our workforce for the new technologies by giving them scientific training. We also need investment to grow at a faster rate. We are all familiar with the idea advocated by Mr von Wogau, according to which what we need is a flexible workforce. I would like to counter this with the example of Portugal, where employment laws are not flexible, and where unemployment stands at less than 5% - and has been steadily decreasing over the last few years - because investment is increasing, with Community support of course, at a rate considerably higher than the Community average. What we want, therefore, is for Europe to enjoy economic growth, but also be prepared to address social issues. Mr President, like many others, I want to thank Mr Katiforis for an interesting report. When I read the report and see the picture of the EU' s economy that is described there, I think it is quite a worrying picture. Investment levels are too low, unemployment is still too high and there is insufficient growth. It is not, therefore, perhaps so strange that the euro is continuing to lose ground to other currencies, in spite of rumours to the effect that the European Central Bank is purchasing the euro on the quiet in order to support it. The rapporteur observes that stability is not an end in itself, which is something I agree with. There is far too much talk about stability, convergence and coordination and far too little about the factors which give rise to innovation and development. As far as I am concerned, EMU cooperation looms ponderously large as a colossus which will have difficulty keeping afloat in the present swelling economy. My conclusions about this differ completely, however, from those of the previous speaker. I believe we have to place our confidence in human resources, partly through a macro-economic policy which creates demand and potential new jobs and partly - and perhaps above all - by relying upon measures in the workplace such as training, democratisation and good social conditions.	de
I understand that there is no argument about the fact that the Council declaration, on the next sitting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, is not going to include the declaration on the 50th anniversary of the Geneva Conventions, and that this declaration has been proposed for the plenary part-session in March, so that it may be delivered in a solemn and formal way. I understand that there is agreement on this issue. Madam President, this afternoon, in this Chamber, reference was made to a series of reports on the BBC Today programme this morning, which claimed that certain of my colleagues were running personal lobbying companies or somehow misusing their position as Members of this House. These are serious allegations. They are completely untrue, malicious, politically biased and were broadcast in the full knowledge of their falsehood. We are taking legal advice. My colleagues' register of interests is complete. If we find that any Member of this House or their employees collaborated with the BBC in this farrago we will expose them to the opprobrium of this House. Quite, we agree absolutely. b) Sittings of 1 and 2 March 2000 in Brussels Sustainable urban development - rural development - EQUAL initiative . (FR) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, Commissioners and members of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was given the task of drawing up the European Parliament' s report on the Community Initiative Programme INTERREG III. Upon referral to committee, we examined over a hundred amendments and, so far, 17 amendments, some of which have already been presented in committee, have once again been tabled. Before discussing the content of the resolution, I should like to inform you of the elements which I took account of and which guided my work as rapporteur. First of all, I would like to remind you of the function of the INTERREG Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation. This programme constitutes a driving force for development on the European scale. INTERREG is one of the four Community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006, and is the one with the largest budget for implementation, i.e. EUR 4.875 billion as opposed to EUR 3.604 billion at the present time. The INTERREG initiative, created in 1990, is built upon the wish to make the regions of Europe ready for a 'Europe without frontiers' in the context of establishing the great single market. At the time of the reform of the Structural Funds in 1994 and 1996, the INTERREG CIP has incorporated new strands contributing to the development of trans-European transport and energy distribution networks. These programmes promoted cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation within the European Union by encouraging balanced development of the Community area. The INTERREG III programme, for which we have before us today the guidelines issued by the European Commission, pursuant to the terms of European Community Regulation No 1260 de 1999 laying down general provisions on the Structural Funds, continues these measures. It is based on three strands. strand A organises cross-border cooperation between regional and local authorities in border regions, at both internal and external borders of the European Union, on the basis of joint cross-border development strategies which Member States' local and regional authorities are responsible for implementing. strand B governs transnational cooperation between national, regional and local authorities in various Member States or applicant countries regarding regional development, transport networks and the environment.	es
Thirdly, the EU and the ACP have also agreed on a new specific procedure to be launched in serious cases of corruption. This is a real innovation, both in the EU/ACP context and in international relations in general. This procedure will be applied, not only in cases of corruption involving EDF money, but also more widely in any country where the EC is financially involved and where corruption constitutes an obstacle to development. It is thus not confined to EC activities. This is a very important aspect, taking into account the fundability of public finances. By adopting such a provision in the partnership agreement, the EU and the ACP States are together sending a clear and positive signal that will doubtless be appreciated by European taxpayers and hopefully also by European investors. Another new theme in the ACP-EU agreement is migration. We have reached a balanced agreement on cooperation in this area. This new dimension to the partnership agreement reflects the guidelines espoused by the EU in accordance with the Treaty of Amsterdam and with the conclusions of the European Council in Tampere in Finland in October 1999. The European Union undertakes to develop and implement an immigration and asylum policy founded on the principle of partnership with the originating countries and regions. The agreement concluded with the ACP countries paves the way for new initiatives, in particular on the rights of third country citizens within the EU, and measures facilitating their integration. We also agreed on provisions to address questions related to illegal immigration. The EU and the ACP states will initiate the process aimed ultimately at defining, within a framework to be negotiated with each and every ACP country, the ways and means of repatriating immigrants illegally present on the territories of each party. This also covers persons from third countries and stateless persons. These very innovative approaches provide a good opportunity to improve governance. The agreement also offers a good framework to underpin the mutually reinforcing effects of trade cooperation and development aid. We have agreed on a process to establish new trading arrangements that will pursue trade liberalisation between the parties and to formulate provisions on trade-related matters. We have met the concerns of the ACP states as far as the time-frame of the trade negotiations is concerned. Negotiations will start no later than 2002. This two-year preparatory period will be used to strengthen regional integration processes and the ACP countries' capacity to conduct trade negotiations. A six-year period is programmed for these negotiations. We will take account of the economic and social constraints of the ACP countries in two ways: firstly, through human and social development policies to accompany economic and trade reforms and, secondly, by helping the ACP states to become active players in the international economic and trade system through capacity-building and cooperation in multilateral forums. This approach will lead us to a fully WTO compatible regime. Economic operators will be more inclined to establish closer relations with their ACP partners. Domestic and foreign investment will grow and more know-how and technology will be transferred, all of which will boost the ACP countries' competitiveness and ease their gradual integration into the world economy.	it
"In my opinion, it would be a sign of well-thought-out human resource management if the Commission were to share a number of these concerns, so as to ensure that a sensitive sector such as the postal service is liberalised with minimum impact on social conditions. Mr President, postal services and post offices seem to be very topical in Parliament at the moment and rightly so, given their importance. Only last week, in the UK parliament at Westminster the newly-elected MP from our European Free Alliance partners, Plaid Cymru, the party of Wales, made his maiden speech on that subject. The Scottish parliament too recently had a debate with particular reference to the role which post offices, especially in rural areas, play in service provision and the sustainability of rural communities. Liberalisation is not the only potential threat to post office services. Post office outlets in Scotland, as we have heard, handle much more than just mail delivery. Traditionally they have been used by governments and some local authorities as an agency for the payment of state pensions and other benefits as well as a local collection centre for house rents, local taxes and so on. But as the modernisation of public financial systems leads to more and more electronic cash movements straight to and from bank accounts, so the viability of rural post offices is being threatened. If a rural post office closes, usually with the only local shop attached, then a major threat to community sustainability and to social inclusion can result. Instead of allowing post office outlets to be undermined by liberalisation or by the modernisation of systems, governments, and the Commission too, should be encouraging and supporting the extensive network of post office outlets and viewing these as an asset which can be built upon, providing public information and services from a location which is convenient for residents. Mr President, the task of the post office is to ensure that, every day, the post is delivered everywhere, be it in the city or in remote, rural areas, at the same tariff. For 150 years, the postal services have been a public affair and, as such, just like public transport and the power supply, a core task of the national governments. Such recognisable and useful core tasks give the electorate a reason to vote. They are much less interested in a government which takes no interest in these affairs. I once heard a Christian Democratic politician make the following comment in a Dutch village: ""The postal service belongs to us all; taking it away from us is tantamount to theft"" . The existing postal companies no longer fall under democratic control and room is being made for competitors. The newcomers are only interested in those parts of the work that generate high profits at low cost and low prices. They can be the cheapest for a while only by means of a drop in quality for their customers and employees. Such companies have always been around, but they used to be banned, whereas these days they are being heralded as progress."	es
I do, however, have one small concern, when I hear the Commissioner on the subject of the commitments made by their services in the Committee on Budgets. There was a clear agreement, good or bad I will not say, but there was a contract. There was a clear understanding between the Commission services and the Committee on Budgets that there was agreement on Amendments 4 and 7, i.e. on the idea of linking the mobilisation, the implementation, of the second tranche of macrofinancial aid to the condition that donors should first have fulfilled their relative obligations in terms of payment. But, if I understand what Mr Solbes Mira says correctly, then this undertaking was only a tentative one. Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement. Can you confirm the agreement made by your services in the Committee on Budgets, yes or no? Or are you going to drop this proviso, thus breaking the undertaking made to us? No, Mr Bourlanges, I think it is a substantive problem. The problem is how in practical terms to implement the compromise which we accepted. What I proposed to you, and what I still say, is that the Commission will make a statement, in the Council Decision, something like this: The exact amount and timing of implementation of the second tranche will be decided in due course taking into account developments in Kosovo' s external financing needs and contributions from other bilateral donors. With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed. I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche. I agree, absolutely. We shall do so. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. ALTENER The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council. The project has been long and problematic. In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources. Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects. One example is the use of peat. Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned. It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal. The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy.	fr
But there are some questions still outstanding. There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme. The situation of AIDS in Africa now is so serious that more people are dying of AIDS than are dying in conflict. I hope that the Minister will take some time to pursue that particular issue. Medicines are available in the United States but the United States is not making them cheap enough for the people in Africa. I should like to ask the Minister what precisely he is doing about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, where the crops have failed, and where, in six months' time, we will inevitably be back to the situation as it was some years ago in Ethiopia with famine and people dying in their thousands. At the same time, there is a war going on between Eritrea and Ethiopia and the armaments industry in Europe is not short in sending guns, after which we will send the bread. First of all, Mr Andrews, you must understand that I do not agree with your interpretation of my colleague' s speech during the meeting of the Committee on Development. There is no contradiction between our two positions, quite the opposite. Unless we wish to act like megalomaniacs, we cannot in the course of one presidency perform an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginary situations relating to all the enormous issues we face, particularly in the area of external relations. As you can understand, it would be easy to do so. All we would have to do is get a directory of development and put all the items in our programme, one after the other. We are sufficiently responsible to realise that we should only include those which we will be able to manage during the term of our Presidency and - we should always be aware of this - within governments' ability to act and within the scope of the Council. We must understand that there are limitations on what we can achieve, particularly in terms of managing national indicative programmes. You have mentioned Ethiopia, which falls within the scope of national indicative programmes, but there are, as you know, several Community actions to combat AIDS, and in this respect, you are right, and the United States will probably not do any better. Indeed, in terms of development aid policy, I think that Europe has absolutely nothing to worry about for the simple reason that our behaviour in this area compares very favourably with that of the United States. Your question switched to the subject of arms, a broader policy issue which I do not think falls within the scope of this question but which the Council will, of course, address in the future, if it sees fit and if it decides to put it in a specific context. Is the Council aware of the social problems caused by the export of food by the EU to developing countries at prices below the cost of production?	fr
On the one hand, if we establish quotas for women, why do we also not create quotas according to age or ethnic group, quotas of Catholics, of workers, of those who wear glasses. The establishment of social quotas in favour of the very smallest categories would be no more ludicrous than establishing quotas of women. With such a philosophy it would no longer be necessary to organise elections or administrative competitions. It would be sufficient to determine the composition of the ministries and assemblies by means of a statistical calculation. The policy of quotas can only increase the disaffection of the voters with regard to politics by once again giving them the feeling that everything takes place behind their backs. On the other hand, such a policy shows a deep contempt for women. A woman must not attain political or administrative responsibilities automatically thanks to the implementation of the quota but by having her own merits and skills recognised. Ladies, have you so little pride that you would be prepared to hold a ministerial office or wear the sash of an elected representative by virtue of the mathematical odds of the quota? Women deserve more than a quota. It is by reviving the principle of meritocracy that we shall improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision-making process in quantity and quality. Minister, Commissioner, everything you have just said has been very well expressed, even if a few male colleagues, if there are still any in the Chamber, perhaps gnashed their teeth. I know that there are also some women who do not wish to hear of quotas or even of positive action, because they believe that this positive discrimination humiliates them and marks them forever in their careers. But the statistics prove it: the positive action, even the quotas, - if they are not applied blindly, without distinction - have increased the number of women in the decision-making process. That is why we are justified in stating that the use of quotas, as a transitional measure, contributes to balancing out the participation of men and women, particularly in political life. I should like to take this opportunity to remind the Commissioner of some requests and initiatives of this Parliament which her predecessor did not follow up and which are closer to our hearts than the quotas. First of all it concerns our report, which was adopted last year on the occasion of International Women' s Day in Strasbourg, which requests the Commission to submit to us a new proposal to amend the 1976 directive on the implementation of the principle of the equal treatment of men and women. According to the Treaty of Amsterdam, there was no longer any reason to maintain the positive action as a tolerated departure from the principle of equal treatment which only recognises an individual right, and not a right that belongs to the society that wishes to achieve this equality democratically. Things being what they are, nobody should dare any longer to dispute that the right of equality of men and women is a fundamental right of a democratic society, requiring equal treatment and equal opportunity be achieved by a package of active measures, including positive action.	it
What did Mr Katiforis actually propose and what has been taken out of the report? He proposed an ambitious report, based on an optimistic Europe, which sought to establish quantified targets for the results it was seeking to achieve. And Europe has indeed achieved progress by means of quantified targets. Why, for example, was the proposal to increase Europe' s active population to 75% of the total population removed, when we currently have levels of around 60%? An active population of 60% is very low compared with that of Japan or the United States and we cannot match those countries' levels of production with such a low rate of employment.

In this context, I can, in fact, see the EMU project' s main weakness, for it is true that you cannot act like Superman and raise the European economies from above. Instead, you have to mobilise working people and the people out there in the Member States.	es
In Tampere, the question of granting operational powers was discussed. We continue to demand a review of the agreement in order to incorporate better parliamentary and judicial control. The agreement also attracts criticism with regard to EURODAC. Parliament has amended the contractual text. Care must be taken to ensure that the Council complies with Parliament' s modus operandi. Unfortunately, no initiatives have yet materialised regarding other matters and we still await them. Europe as an area of freedom, security and justice has so far been an area with no clear regulation in important sectors. And yet we owe this to the citizens of Europe. Having listened to the justice and home affairs ministers, I am optimistic and I am assuming that we will succeed in the next six months. Mr President, Commissioner, the oral question tabled by Mrs Terrón i Cusí shows that this House is taking a firm stance. Indeed, six months after the election of this new Parliament, we should now be able to send a firm political message to the people of Europe. I believe that the Portuguese Presidency can contribute positively to this. We are all aware of the enormous expectations of our people with regard to freedom, security and justice, particularly social justice. Yet their lack of interest and involvement and sometimes even their distaste for all things political requires us to take specific action to tackle their problems. This is the sine qua non condition for reconciling the popular and political spheres. For Europe to become the symbol of peace and fraternity, we need a bold and generous policy to come to the aid of the most disadvantaged. A proper plan for fighting unemployment must be established for this is the scourge which is allowing the rise of racism, xenophobia, nationalism and extreme-right racist movements. We should remember that the most disadvantaged include immigrants and refugees. The virtually systematic conditions of detention and the criminalisation of asylum-seekers are no longer acceptable. All asylum-seekers must be entitled to a fair hearing and an appeal with suspensory effect. Last week, and somewhat by chance, I witnessed, at Roissy airport, a scene of rare violence in which two young women, admittedly illegal immigrants, were being returned to Conakry. They were treated like the worst criminals. They were stripped naked and dragged along the floor by their hair, surrounded by a horde of state security police. The Portuguese Presidency must put an end to this type of barbaric behaviour. Our role should be to accompany, reassure and assist those who are fleeing dictatorships. The Commission has proposed creating a European fund for refugees to which Parliament was favourably disposed. Instead of all this waffling about the budget granted to this fund, we could take the decision to set this up. The Presidency and the Council can realise what was incomprehensibly rejected in Tampere, even though this summit provided an important basis. Likewise, we cannot simply record the rise in xenophobic feelings in Europe and the increasingly common discrimination without taking wide-ranging action.	de
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference. As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid.  Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission. There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these. The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly. Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future. The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament. As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry. According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases. Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid. In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany. Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid. The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996. These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether. In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece. However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report. As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired. There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code. No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe. This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years. Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations. We all know that so far the Council has dragged its feet with regard to follow-up regulations of this kind. The reason for this is that people are under the impression that once the steel aid code expires, they will be able to do their own thing again without the inconvenience of the European Commission' s supervision. We therefore demand that once the Treaty expires, steel aid must be regulated by a Council regulation according to Article 94, for that is the only way to create the necessary legal validity and clarity.	de
As Members of Parliament, we must pay particular attention to the fact that the work begun to establish fundamental rights is more important than ever. It is more important than ever that respect for, and non-violation of, human values and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all those who live within the territory of the European Union, form an essential component in the rule of law principle of the EU, and, for this reason, the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding. It must not be allowed to remain a mere declaration. As important is the fact that Austria' s forces of democracy should be given support, as none of us wishes to isolate the country. We know that most Austrians respect these values. They have also shown how they feel: not all the demonstrations have taken place outside Austria. Doubtless there are also a lot of protest voters on the scene that have wanted a change in Austrian policy for a long time. I believe Parliament should support these forces of democracy. I also appeal to the Austrian President, that he might yet look into all the possibilities for forming a government made up of democratic forces. Madam President, I would simply like to stress the value of the attitude that the leader of our group, Francis Wurtz, reminded us of just now. I welcome the statements by the Presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 countries which have rejected official contact with an Austrian Government that includes Jörg Haider' s party. The fact that we are stressing this is all the more important because, as you know, we essentially disagree with the policies made by Europe, with its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit and the Member States' involvement in the terrible war in the Balkans. Our normal disagreement further emphasises our appreciation today: this is extraordinary because the danger of a resurgence of an irrational, neo-nazi element in Europe is extraordinary. This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe. We are talking about us, not Austria. We know the social causes which contribute, along with unemployment and instability, to fuelling tendencies towards this; we know the accompanying cultural causes - xenophobia, racism - but with the inability and unwillingness of these extreme right-wing groups to settle accounts with nazism, we cannot fail to point out the possibility of an explosive mixture being created in Europe. Not only the Alpine region, but all our countries are involved: the conditions are being created whereby democracy and European civilisation may once again come under threat. The position taken by the presidency has shown that it is aware of this tragedy for civilisation. Europe is showing that it has not forgotten Auschwitz; Europe is coming face to face with the suffering of the past. Now, though, it should follow through with its actions, and the first to follow through should be the Commission, which, however, has been obscure and weak on this, making the value of the presidency' s position even more apparent. This is the change we must impose on the Commission' s action. Madam President, despite the fundamental democratic principle of the respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, which opposes fascism, nazism or communism, both new and old, and despite all the previous speakers talking about the sovereignty of the Austrian people, we are today witnessing this sovereignty being denied by Parliament.	de
There is nothing to prevent the spread of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent the major concerns driving part of the population into poverty simply to make their shareholders richer still! We acknowledge that this report does have one good point - it shows that the working class majority in society can expect nothing from the European institutions in terms of safeguarding their living conditions, and still less of improving them. - (FR) In voting against this report, we are acting as spokespersons for all the men and women who in Seattle and throughout Europe expressed their rejection of a world reduced to strict commercial logic. We are voting against this report on behalf of the development of public services, in memory of the victims of the Paddington rail disaster, killed not by fate but by an absurd determination to have competition where there should instead be regulations. This report is essentially a primitive text with no inspiration other than the law of the jungle, for it is not competition that can solve the problems facing humanity at this turn of the century. Whether it is a matter of the balance of the biosphere, culture or cooperation with the third world, excessive competition is a factor increasing regression and insecurity. Do you imagine that the 18 million unemployed people in Europe are victims of too reticent an application of this competition policy? We are convinced that the opposite is true, and we do not think that state aid is by definition excessive. Excessive in comparison with what iron rule, what criteria of efficiency? Finally, after Seattle, do you really think you can advocate increasing the role of the WTO? Only the legal advisers to multinationals could demonstrate such stubbornness. Jonckheer Report (A5-0087/1999) I am pleased to see the quality of the seventh report on state aid within the EU, and to see that it will henceforth be an annual report, and also that the Directorate-General for Competition will be making information, both general and specific, publicly accessible via its website. I am happy with the rapporteur' s treatment of state aid and I congratulate him on this. There is too often a tendency to criticise state aid harshly as a measure causing distortion in competition. Admittedly, an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper operation of the internal market and of economic and monetary union. However, as the rapporteur pointed out, such aid is occasionally essential and may, in addition to enabling the survival of a specific firm, make it possible to contribute to sustainable development (Article 6 of the Treaty), services of general economic interest (Article 16) and economic and social cohesion (Article 158). Clearly though, it must be monitored, a task which falls to the European Commission. The aid which Union Member States allocate each year to the sectors under consideration reached a total of EUR 95 billion in the period 1995-1997, including 40% allocated to the manufacturing sector. This aid is considerably less than the previous period, 1993-1995 (a 13% drop in the total amount and a drop from 3.8% to 2.6% in the amount of aid to the manufacturing sector). This downturn in aid is chiefly due to the reduction in aid granted to the new German Länder.	de
Another issue is that of what we are to do when state aid is declared unlawful. How do we ensure that unlawful state aid is paid back? At present, there are no common rules in this area, and we vigorously urge the Commission to make a point of harmonising the rules on repayment. This is the way forward if we are to ensure uniform conditions of competition. Finally, we propose keeping both a register, as mentioned by a number of my fellow MEPs, and also a scoreboard showing where the Member States at present stand with regard to state aid. You have shown us the way, Mr Monti, with the single market scoreboard. It was this which inspired us to propose the same thing with regard to state aid. I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter. To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done. But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness. There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid. This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition. As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems. Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered. Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy? Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid. It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements. So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified. The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level. We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything. We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact. Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy. But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us.	de
The situation in the refugee camps in Ingushetia is poor and deteriorating. In most cases there is no hot food during the day as the Russian authorities are failing to provide this and are leaving this work to the non-governmental organisations. In Grozny, there are now approximately 20 000 people in a desperate situation who have to walk miles and miles to get something to eat. Yet there is one positive point which I must share with you. Mr Gil-Robles told me that, when talking with the Acting President and the Foreign Affairs Minister last night, the Russian authorities had agreed to allow Council of Europe representatives to be involved in the humanitarian mission which is in Grozny at the moment and which is being directed by the Russian authorities. The latter were also in negotiation with the Chairman-in-Office of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe to allow OSCE representatives to be involved as well, if feasible. These are the only positive aspects which I can tell you about at the moment. I hope that in the next few hours we will have more information from Commissioner Gil-Robles and, in particular, better news from the Russian authorities. Madam President, this brings me to the end of my speech. I would just like to repeat what I said at the beginning. I am delighted to be participating in the work of this House and to be informing you about the work which is being carried out collectively by all the countries and with the Commission. This work has one clear objective of allowing our European Union to participate as effectively as possible in the international sphere in peacekeeping operations. Europe does not want to make war anywhere but rather to cooperate so that peace and stability can be achieved throughout the world. Thank you very much indeed, Mr Solana. I shall now give the floor to Mr Poettering, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats. Thank you, Mr Poettering. Mr Poettering, it goes without saying that Commissioner Patten' s participation in this debate is most opportune, and we have agreed that I will allow him to speak when he so wishes. Commissioner, would you like to speak now or a little later? (The Commissioner indicated that he would speak later) Very well, thank you. Madam President, Commissioner Patten, Mr Javier Solana, usted no es una persona loca, todo lo contrario (you are not mad, quite the opposite). We are delighted about the rapid progress which has been made following the Helsinki Summit. We know that you have an important role in this. I am also very pleased that you have mentioned Mozambique today, and in this context, and that a major humanitarian effort can be made using the resources in question. We cannot, of course, talk about foreign policy without mentioning Chechnya. My friend Jacques Poos will be talking about this on behalf of my Group. I want to concentrate on Kosovo. It is now quite clear that the situation in Kosovo shows that a lasting solution to the crisis there cannot be provided by military means. The KFOR forces have made, and are making, an invaluable contribution, but tanks and fire trenches cannot deal with political problems and ethnic conflicts in the longer term.	de
The Council is consulting us and Parliament is giving its opinion. We want an Intergovernmental Conference, but not this one. Must there be an IGC? Of course there must, but not this type of Intergovernmental Conference. The agenda must go much further. We must be much more daring with regard to the issues dealt with in the IGC and we must be much more transparent and much more democratic. Being much more democratic means greater participation by the European Parliament and allowing the Commission to exercise even more - yes, more - its ability to take the initiative. We must clearly set firm objectives. The functionalist approach is over, for better or for worse. The functionalist approach has brought us to this point. Have we achieved results? Yes, but the point is to make a qualitative leap and, speaking in political terms, this, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, means convincing the other Community partners that to fall short would be the worst thing we could do at the moment. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen of the House, at this stage, following this debate which I have listened to most attentively and with great interest, I should like to make a few comments in addition to the guidelines and the statements which it has been my honour to present to you in the course of recent weeks in the company of President Prodi. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, in the report which they produced after extremely thorough and meticulous work, your two rapporteurs, Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, proposed that Parliament should adopt a formal opinion pursuant to Article 48 of the Treaty and thus, if this opinion were adopted, the Intergovernmental Conference could effectively start on 14 February, as suggested by the Portuguese Presidency. As far as we are concerned, after producing the opinion expected from the Commission, according to this same Article 48 of the Treaty, we are pleased that the conference can thus begin earlier than anticipated. We know, I know myself, that the weeks we have before us will be useful to us. I would just like to make a few comments, after reading the draft opinion and after listening to the speakers on behalf of the various groups. Firstly, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission understands the anxiety expressed by a number of you with regard to the scope of the conference agenda. I understand this anxiety, this fear that the agenda may be too limited, and yet I feel, as I said to the Committee on Constitutional Affairs on returning from Helsinki, that we can work on the basis of this Helsinki mandate. Indeed, it is in this spirit and in the framework of this mandate, which the Commission framed for its own opinion, but using all the terms thereof, plus everything between the lines. We have not restricted ourselves to the three so-called leftovers, which is, in any case, an incorrect label. I do not like the term 'leftovers' any more than Richard Corbett does. It gives the impression that they are three minor or insignificant subjects whereas in fact they are three extremely serious and important subjects, and difficult, so difficult that we did not have sufficient political courage collectively at Amsterdam to deal with them in depth. As far as we are concerned - I am responding to Mr Seguro who expressed concerns about this just now - we have not restricted ourselves to these three subjects, even though I do consider them as priorities, and consider that they must be dealt with now.	it
"This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union. Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000): - (SV) The most important task of the approaching Intergovernmental Conference is to reform the EU before the accession of the new Member States. We therefore, of course, support the European Parliament' s now giving the formal go-ahead to the Intergovernmental Conference. We nonetheless consider that the agenda for the Intergovernmental Conference should be limited to questions which have to be resolved if it is to be possible for enlargement to take place. We also argued this in November 1999, and we would therefore refer to our explanation of vote of 18 November 1999. . (FR) In the opinion which it has just adopted on the convening of the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, the European Parliament calls for a ""constitutional process to be launched"" . This determination to override nations with a legally supranational text is also expressed in the first meetings of the body responsible for drawing up the so-called Charter of Fundamental Rights, which is really a closet constitution. It is expressed again in the unbelievable excess perpetrated by the European Parliament which today in its vote on a resolution wished to cancel out the result of the free elections in Austria. The same determination to reduce nations to the level of mere administrative regions is also evident on every page of the opinion issued by the Commission for the Intergovernmental Conference. The key idea involves making qualified majority voting the general rule while modifying the content of this qualified majority to make it a double simple majority, of States and peoples, in order to increase the Commission' s room for manoeuvre and reduce that of the minority States. Incidentally, the French will probably be interested to learn that the Commission is asking for Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty to be amended in order to establish majority voting and codecision with the European Parliament. People will remember that this article, dealing with the transfer of immigration policy to the Community level, stipulated that for five years decisions would still be taken by unanimous vote in the Council and thereafter the Council would assess a potential opportunity to amend the system. In France, both in the National Assembly and in the Senate, when this was being ratified, many members of the French parliament were reassured to hear that, in any case, the Council would remain free to choose and could retain unanimous decision-making. Well, today, the same Minister of European Affairs who drew up the Treaty of Amsterdam, who has, in the meantime, become a European Commissioner, Mr Barnier, proposes to decide, at the forthcoming IGC, that the Council will operate in these areas by majority decision. This is the type of mechanism we are continually subjected to when playing the game of European integration with the Brussels institutions. The French must be made aware not only that the purpose of all these operations is to eliminate their country as a responsible centre for decision making, but that furthermore every means will be used to extract their consent."	es
The two principle resources of the Atlantic shore, fishing and tourism, both closely interrelated, have both been seriously affected. There is a danger that the season will be lost, resulting in an extremely serious crisis by the end of the year. The fact that Parliament is presenting a new resolution, one to which our Group has made a significant contribution, is therefore perfectly justifiable. It emphasises a number of points deemed crucial at grass roots level. The first point is that the polluter must accept his liability in full. Our resolution calls for two principles to be applied: the first is the 'polluter cleans' principle, since it is unacceptable that the cleaning of coasts polluted by hydrocarbon cargoes should be borne by the local authorities, i.e. the taxpayers, i.e. the victims, and not the cargo owner. The second principle is the 'polluter pays' principle. According to our resolution, the polluter' s liability must extend to fishing, fish farming and aquaculture industries and businesses. This is essential. It means that the polluter cannot claim to limit the amount of compensation for victims in line with the ceiling set by FIPOL, which is to say, by the goodwill of the major oil companies. If the FIPOL ceiling is insufficient, and it has clearly been underestimated, then it must be raised. Our resolution calls for this. If the increase is not enough then the polluter should pay the balance. It would be particularly unfair to have an oil company, whose profits this year amount to FRF 10 billion, refusing to give 100% compensation to its own victims, the great majority of whom are small businesses and employees. Commissioner, the stricken people await tangible expressions of solidarity at European level. Our resolution calls upon the Commission to take the necessary steps to assist in repairing the damage caused in the fishing industry affected by the consequences of the disaster. Maritime Europe and the CFP must today demonstrate that, in addition to imposing constraints on fishermen, it is not unfamiliar with the concept of solidarity. The European Union must also participate in the restoration of the wetland and coastal environments affected, whose biological value is important to the Union as a whole. Mr Fischler has just told us that he would welcome France' s requests. I am pleased to hear it. We must act as a catalyst in this crucial issue of maritime pollution. Twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster laxness and irresponsibility still reign supreme in Europe in matters of maritime safety, resulting in yet more oil slicks. This time, we must not let inertia win the day. A basis for maritime safety must be drawn up speedily, respecting the principle of subsidiarity, and we must at long last put an end to this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility. Mr President, the economy of the western Atlantic coastline has been devastated, polluted by oil from the Erika. Fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, workers in the tourist industry, and local and regional authorities are growing impatient while waiting for aid and for someone to deal with the time-bomb which the apparently still leaking wreck represents.	es
There is, of course, no reciprocity in favour of European UCITS. We shall also vote against the abolition of the facility for the Member States to increase to 35% ... (The President cut the speaker off) Mr President, this is a vital issue for Europe. A Europe that faces an impending pensions time bomb must take every step to encourage saving and maximise the return that the people of Europe can obtain on their savings. I welcome many of the developments which Mr Schmidt' s report brings us. UCITS are a success story within the European Union. They are a safe product, traded cross-border. But it is time for the legislation to be updated. Mr Schmidt has done an excellent job here. It is no secret that I would have much preferred Mr Schmidt' s report not to have been altered so much as it passed through Parliament. But I appeal to this House to take a balanced and common-sense approach on this issue. The radical step taken by this report is to allow UCITS to use over-the-counter derivatives. I appeal to everyone here to evaluate the products which will be used by UCITS. We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculation. We are talking about the use of derivatives to reduce risk and to increase the returns on the savings of ordinary Europeans. Mr Schmidt is to be applauded for having obtained the support of Parliament for over-the-counter derivatives. We must not be afraid to go forward, to react to changes in the market. Yes, we need to continue to ensure that UCITS provide a balanced and protected product for consumers. The report gives very adequate protection for consumers. But a number of the amendments go too far in restricting the use of over-the-counter derivatives. I feel these derivatives will be an addition to the portfolio of unit trusts, which can only help individual people around Europe obtain a high return on their savings. I salute Mr Schmidt. Thank you very much Mr Kuckelkorn. Ladies and gentlemen, I have an update for you on the curtain and window situation. If we open this curtain, then we will find that there is a partition wall behind it which cannot just be removed straight away. We will therefore have to defer this experiment until the next plenary sitting. However, I will make sure that we have a go then and see how the land lies. Mr President, the UCITS directive has been an enormous success since it entered into force on 1 October 1989, mainly thanks to the excellent protection which it offers investors. The directive and the reputation which UCITS enjoy with investors have allowed the investment fund industry to multiply its assets in the European Union fivefold. There has been a strong increase in cross-border marketing of investments within the European Union and the directive itself is used as a model for legislation throughout the world. However, the directive is ten years old and, now that the markets have developed and more and more sophisticated financial products are available, it is somewhat outdated.	es
Is there currently a sufficient legal basis for justifying, in legal terms, the creation of a specifically Community-wide criminal law which, although it might be called subsidiary, will always clash with the practice, and in certain areas, with the traditional, separate criminal law of the Member States? As there are doubts, would it not be more advisable, from a political point of view, to put the reform of the legal system on the IGC agenda, and incorporate these proposals into the more general reform of the Union' s legal system along the lines of what is being requested for the European Public Prosecutor? Surely these subjects will be of the greatest relevance to a revision of the treaties which will contribute to the stability of the area of freedom, security and justice? Mr President, the EU is now exposed to tough scrutiny. Confidence in the European Union has been seriously damaged. To remedy this, vigorous efforts are required. We therefore welcome increased resources for OLAF so that we can investigate any suspicions more efficiently. At the same time, we think it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU must be able to be held accountable in an effective way. It is unfortunate that the convention for protecting the Union' s financial interests has been put into effect in so few Member States. We therefore think it only right that the Commission should have the task of tabling proposals entailing the further development of the already existing legal framework. On the other hand, I am not convinced that making the process more efficient in this way requires common European legislation or centralisation of the fight against crime. In the present situation, I am therefore sceptical about the idea of a European prosecutor, which it is scarcely possible to implement within the framework of the present treaty. We have more confidence in Eurojust, where prosecutors from the individual nations cooperate. The major problem is not that no measures are being taken against crimes committed against the Union but, rather, that these are committed so often and far too seldom discovered. The challenge for the Commission and for ourselves is, however, to find the right mix. The mismanagement and examples of fraud which occur ought not to lead to our ending up in an old-fashioned hierarchical bureaucracy which, through an exaggerated supervision of detail, prevents the development of a modern administration. We therefore welcome the aggressive approach of Mr van Hulten' s report. The main idea ought to be that each administration takes responsibility for its own supervision. Our experience of modern administration tells us that openness, decentralisation of responsibility and qualified evaluation are often as effective as detailed bureaucratic supervision. The major challenge is, therefore, to create a modern and efficient administration without compromising on supervision and the rule of law. This requires staff training, more modern recruitment methods and, above all, openness and public control. Being able to scrutinise the administration effectively is the best protection against irregularities.	fr
This has been talked about for years. The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell. It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes. A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines. It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union. Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations? Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence. And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect. For these are prerequisite to any development. If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow. I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba. After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International. It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned. Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union. There is a second issue I would like to raise. We are discussing coherence here. Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent. In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too. There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another. Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability. This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union. Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly.	de
Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world. No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information. In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged. This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs. When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators. The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this. I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect. In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone. Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming. We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations. Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat. Our world is now dominated by a single logic or, I could say, a single god of money at work instead of people at work. With a figure for trade in goods and services of FRF 36 000 billion only being equal to the product of four days' speculation, the financial bubble owes very little to the productive activity of individuals. It is self-perpetuating in a world of ever higher bids which constantly denies the humanity of man, the rich as much as the poor. Yet it is the latter who, at the end of the day, are excluded from the majority of the world' s decision-making centres for these are monopolised by a tiny minority referred to recently, and very aptly, by Jean-Pierre Chevènement as the globalised élites.	fr
I too would like to compliment Mr Hudghton on his report and to endorse his additions to the original proposal in relation both to the matter of compensation and encouragement of vaccine development.  I too agree that Amendments 7 to 13 are unfortunate, indeed Amendment 13 would not merely negate the intended effects of the proposal but actually would make the situation even more difficult than under current rules. This is not though to deny the importance of environmental considerations in relation to fish farming. Mr Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the UK joint government industry working group on ISA and the measures there are of relevance for fish farming wherever it happens, not just in farms affected by ISA. Secondly, looking forward to the motion for a resolution on the Katiforis report later this evening, paragraph 28 is of particular importance. This calls on the Commission and Member States to step up the adoption of measures to combat the possible negative effects of aquaculture on the marine environment. Thirdly, referring to the earlier discussion on the collection of fisheries data, I very much hope that the Commission will engage in projects and studies looking at aquaculture in the environmental context but I believe that is the way forward in relation to the environment, not the way that is suggested in Amendments 7 to 13, and I hope honourable Members will reject them.  Mr President, I do not agree with this chorus of satisfaction expressed by my colleagues, who are delighted about the relaxing of a directive that respects the principle of precaution and which takes measures to protect consumers' health. This infectious salmon disease is caused by an orthomixomicrovirus which breaks down the blood of salmon, causing death. It spreads very easily through mucus in saline water, etc. Under the 1993 directive, not only the diseased fish can be culled but also the farmed fish where individuals are affected, exactly like the case when one cow is sick in a herd and the whole herd is culled according to the principle of precaution. What we currently propose is to relax this directive, so that we do not cull all the fish, but only the fish that are found to be diseased. For the others, well, we would have time to see what would happen, according to local circumstances. I think it is a very serious matter that we act in this way. I would particularly draw my colleagues' attention to this fact as we cannot make do with saying that a temperature of 27º has every advantage for the human race and that, consequently, there is no risk to men. What about women? Nobody has undertaken any studies on human tissue in that regard. There is also a risk to the environment, because we know that there is an incubation period in salmon and that, consequently, if they are eaten, they can be carriers of this virus and present a risk. There is another risk to the environment as well, because this disease is transmitted to wild fish, as we have seen. For this reason, together with my colleague, Patricia McKenna, we have tabled amendments against the proposals made by the Commission.	it
We should like to see the scope of a couple of points extended. We will therefore vote for the Greens' Amendments Nos 102, 103 and 104, which we consider to be improvements on the present position. As regards pricing policy, there are sometimes extreme cases which may require derogations from the principles laid down in the report. My own view is that the options for allowing derogations had already been given proper attention in Amendment No 43, tabled by the committee and been even more clearly set out in the Greens' Amendment No 105. I cannot see any need for other derogations besides those specified in the two amendments just mentioned. However, some people in our political group think otherwise. Consequently, Amendment No 107, on the same question, has been tabled by one section of our group only. On the whole, I welcome the committee's proposals set out in Mrs Lienemann's report and think they could provide a good basis for a hard-won compromise. Mr President, every satellite photo proves that we do indeed live on the blue planet, yet the abundance of water is an illusion. The recent disaster on the Danube serves as a reminder that our rivers are the lifelines of our planet and that pollution does not respect borders. Water is a renewable but limited natural resource. It becomes scarcer when it is mismanaged and when the geographical and climatic conditions are unfavourable. In the EU, this is a crucial issue in the Mediterranean region and also in other European countries where we are witnessing the gradual drying of wet areas. The increase in vulnerable areas, both wet and dry, inequalities between countries, inequalities between different regions within countries and unusual climatic, economic, geographical and geological events are all the evidence we need. However, these must not lead to competition distortions within the Community. We have therefore tabled amendments to highlight the importance of the special relationship between agriculture and water, given that water is an essential factor in the occupation and development of the land. Agricultural needs are clearly much greater in the south and this specific point must be taken into account in the framework directive. It is not only in the Member States that solutions to these problems are being sought. Last October in Turin, the countries in the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership bluntly demanded a Marshall plan for water for the south coast of the Mediterranean. We are not, fortunately, at this point. However, we are in Europe experiencing droughts and desertification in certain regions and also floods, which the directive underlines. For example, France, the Rhine valley and central Europe recently suffered flooding. We need this framework directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy which must make the various uses of water compatible with each other. Yet we also need to integrate the protection and conservation of biodiversity into this new management of water. The water issue will definitely not be settled today. In fact, the problems of enlargement and climate change will offer new prospects.	fr
The problem is one of both water quality and water resources, of which there is not a plentiful supply everywhere in Europe, especially in very dry regions. I am sorry that Commissioner Wallström, who is responsible in this area, cannot be here now because this is, after all, a very, very important directive on which the Commission has been working for a long time, and water protection legislation, which we are debating now at second reading, affects all the citizens of the European Union as well as all the people in countries wishing to join, who will have to comply with EU legislation once they accede. We have been working on this subject for ten years and a comprehensive approach was only made possible as the result of a hearing arranged and held by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy in 1994. A great deal of work has been carried out between then and this second reading by numerous Members of the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of Ministers. We reduced the 243 proposed amendments in the Environment Committee to 77, but another 30 have been added. You see, there are numerous matters of concern here and they are all very different. Some want tighter legislation, some want more clarification, others want to serve national interests. Even within my group, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats, there were, of course, differences of opinion. Our line is to work towards realistic objectives and practicable solutions. In this sense, the proposed amendments tabled by me and other members on behalf of the group represent an improvement on the demands set out in the common position. Some proposed amendments which we support should strengthen the European Parliament' s negotiating position in the forthcoming conciliation with the Council of Ministers. We obviously reject all unrealistic demands which affect the European Parliament' s credibility. For me, that includes the zero demand, i.e. the demand for zero inputs up to 2020. That would sound the death knell for every agricultural and many industrial undertakings. I should like to stress quite particularly here that we have already made considerable progress under current national and European water protection laws, however imperfect they are and however little they are complied with in the Member States. I only need to remind you that we again have salmon in the Rhine, which would have been unthinkable 20 years ago and that salmon are due to be released this spring in the Elbe, which was particularly polluted. That does not mean that we do not still have huge efforts to make in order to improve water protection yet further and maintain the quality of water and ground water and this will doubtless cost a great deal of money. Farmers have voiced a number of concerns over the past few days. You can only farm if you have an adequate supply of clean water. The line followed by our group for the negotiations with the Council of Ministers will allow an acceptable solution to be found for farmers too.	es
We need more police officers, as we have nowhere near enough. We need an independent judiciary - this would certainly be difficult to establish -, we also need funds for the office of High Commissioner for Human Rights. All of this needs to happen, and quickly too. If we do not provide rapid assistance then the situation will deteriorate and new conflicts and crisis situations may arise. That is why I believe that we were right to take action quickly, to recognise the urgency of the situation and make funds available. Only, now we want to see this translate into deeds and we also want to see success in Kosovo, and I would urge the Commission to see that these funds are put to good use, notably for building up the police force and for establishing the judiciary. . (ES) Mr President, I would like firstly to thank the Members, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue. This will no doubt allow us to release the funds for Kosovo quickly and deal with the concerns which both Mr Swoboda and Mrs Pack have mentioned. I think I have seen three types of fundamental concern in tonight' s debate. Firstly, although much progress has been made, and we could mention customs administration, bank administration or tax administration, it is true that we must continue to move forward. However, in moving forward, what should we be financing? This is the first point on which there is a certain amount of disagreement. In some of your amendments you propose that we limit further the type of bodies which can be provided with Union funds, for example, Amendments Nos 3 and 5. In our view, however, in both respects, greater room for manoeuvre should be left to the administration of the United Nations which, on the ground, is more aware of the reality than we are. We believe that to prejudge, at the moment, where resources should be directed, would create more practical difficulties. In short, we should put our faith in those parties who, in these areas, are better equipped than us to make certain decisions. The second concern which I notice that many of you share - it was first expressed by Mr Bourlanges, but others have repeated it - refers to the situation regarding the other donors. Is the Commission making an excessive effort while others are failing to cooperate? Some of the amendments in your report pose this question. For example, Amendments Nos 1, 2 and 4. I would say to Mr Bourlanges and to those who have raised this issue, that this is not the fundamental problem, although we recognise it totally. The fundamental problem is that, at the moment, the distribution of the burden amongst the different donors has been established in the statements of the High Level Steering Group, but it is also true that they have no legal status. This is simply a political commitment. That is the reason why, while accepting its spirit, we would ask that Amendment No 1 be worded differently - and we have sent a note to Mr Brok in this respect - so that it does not imply conditionality in the provision of Community resources.	fr
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time. However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee. The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost. Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union. Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either. Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes. This coordination is at present lacking, and the Commission has not as yet made any precise proposals to improve it. We here in Parliament are waiting for the Commission to give the committee a more detailed explanation of the issue as soon as possible. It is of decisive importance to get local business, organisations and other players involved in the practical implementation of programmes. Experience shows that projects of cooperation need better planning and closer monitoring and need to be generally more successful. Projects have often remained half-finished, and their efficiency has been drained by administration and bureaucracy. We also have to demand that our partners in cooperation be committed to projects and fulfil their share of the agreement. Our group is reviewing a few amendments that were rejected by the committee. I would like to mention here again the URBAN report, in which the rapporteur, in the explanatory statements, has dealt admirably with the issue of the minimum sum of EUR 500 per inhabitant as per the Commission' s guidelines. It will not work as an automatic target, but must be applied in the target area according to prevailing conditions. This is such an important matter for consideration that firm conclusions have to drawn. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, INTERREG is one of the most European of all the Structural Funds. Here, projects covering only one region or one country will not receive support; they will have to cover neighbouring regions in two or more countries. Unfortunately this is only true for part of the money, that is only for the borders within the EU. But it is precisely the regions on borders with third countries which need an operational instrument to foster cross-border cooperation. The regulation pretends that there is one, but there is not. The fact is that the Commission has not amended the regulation for years, although Parliament has been calling for it to do so for some time. The practical consequence for these regions in the immediate future is that support for border areas will again be downgraded. Since 1996, Parliament has been calling for a joint fund to be created for cooperation with third countries in order to resolve difficulties. Nothing has happened! The difficulties are once again being allowed to persist, to the detriment of the regions concerned. Parliament is here renewing its call for an improvement and for cross-border cooperation, and we look forward to a joint fund being created and to the regulation being amended once more in cooperation with the other Commissioners.	de
. Mr President, the draft Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is approaching adoption by the Council. Most say it is about time. According to the action plan to combat organised crime adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work on the draft MLA Convention should have been finalised before the end of 1997. More time will pass before the Convention actually enters into force, given the fact that this requires Member States' ratification. Even with the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, foreseeing its entry into force once at least half of the Member States have adopted the Convention, I would like to urge the Member States to do everything in their power to speedily ratify this Convention. Past experience with ratification of European Union conventions in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is unfortunately disappointing. This Convention will not create a new or different system of Mutual Assistance. Instead it aims at building on tried and tested mechanisms that have been in place for a very long time, such as the ones foreseen by the Council of Europe Convention on mutual assistance of 1959 and the Benelux Treaty. The draft that the Council has elaborated contains provisions on a variety of matters that have been discussed by several Members of Parliament. It is a considerable achievement of the Convention that where at all possible requested Member States shall comply with the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member States. This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using evidence that is obtained in court. Furthermore, requests can be made directly between the competent authorities without any need to go via central authorities. Generally speaking, there are two kinds of provisions: those that create an obligation to render assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and on the interception of telecommunications; and those where no such obligation is created and only a legal framework is provided for Member States that wish to cooperate in the manner prescribed, for example, the provisions on joint investigation teams, covert investigations and the sending and service of procedural documents. The Commission particularly welcomes the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in fighting the form of crime that is best placed to take advantage of the opening of borders - organised crime. It is all too easy to get carried away by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations. However, one aspect of any action with regard to criminal procedures must not be forgotten - the right of defence. I very much appreciate that the report of Mr Di Pietro, whom I salute for the excellent work he has done in such a short period of time, includes the right of defence as one of its main points. At the present time it is entirely up to the Member States to ensure that those rights are respected under the scrutiny of the Council of Europe' s Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.	es
This is not new. Ever since we have attempted to do something about development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality have been called into question. Hope of improvement threatens to be nipped in the bud if the Commission keeps refusing to look into the mirror. Why was the critical report on the coherence of development policy not disseminated externally? One of the major conclusions of this report concerned the European policy' s internal conflict. In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy. We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries. This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation. We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right. I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy. As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way. Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense. As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries. And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry. We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies. So there is a whole raft of contradictions. In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States. We have to be aware of this. We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment. For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies. We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies. That is a fact of life. And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy. We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one.	fr
Similarly, as concerns the field of justice and criminal law, which we have discussed today, I believe not only that the different criminal law, juridical and administrative legislative systems should be coordinated, but also that we must at last formulate common standards: an offence committed in Italy must also be viewed as an offence in Great Britain, Spain or elsewhere. I believe that we, the Parliament of the European Union, who are the elected representatives of the citizens, must give sharper impetus to ensuring that the European Union provides for the regulation of every facet of the lives of its citizens, including that of justice, and that of pensions. . We vote against this report, because by allowing trans-border interception of telecommunication and reversing the burden of proof, the Convention will create the legal ground for large scale bugging operations in the EU. That means, making a European bugging system like the transatlantic spying operation 'Echelon' perfectly legal. This Convention will lead to gross abuses of people' s rights to privacy. It is a major threat to civil liberties in EU. Also the following points are unacceptable for us: joint investigation teams, controlled deliveries, undercover investigations, inaccuracy of the text on the scope of the convention, lack of respect of the principle of proportionality, lack of democratic guarantees. Resolution on the Commission' s strategic objectives for 2000-2005 . Commissioner Prodi pointed out that 'Africa is our responsibility' and not apparently that of the USA and other major countries. I worked in Africa 30 years ago, and it was poor and underdeveloped but the problems are now more catastrophic. Two million people died of AIDS in Africa last year, approximately 200 000 died in wars. In Zambia 25% of teachers have died of AIDS. In some countries children had a better chance of basic education and health care twenty years ago than they have today. Our policies in Africa lack coherence. There is huge duplication of effort. Furthermore, the cloud of debt remains an obstacle to real development. It is patently clear that Africa has become the forgotten continent. . (FR) In its communication on its strategic objectives for 2000-2005, the Commission repeats that Europe needs to become a 'global actor' capable of speaking with a strong voice in the world. What should this global actor' s objective be? Doubtless our citizens would say something along the lines of 'to defend the countries of Europe better' , since that is the traditional and primordial purpose of political associations. And yet this phrase is nowhere to be seen. All we find are vague phrases about 'strategic partnerships' and the new prospects for trade which the complete integration of Europe would apparently bring with it. The omission of this principal objective is highly revealing. It demonstrates one of the main flaws in the European Union, a little-known, almost always implicit flaw, but one which goes a long way towards explaining our citizens' loss of interest. There is a highly revealing passage on this point in the work programme for the year 2000 attached to the strategic guidelines.	it
At the time of that visit I will also, as recommended by honourable Members and others, be upgrading our representation in FYROM. The target date for concluding the negotiations is December this year but this will depend to a very large extent on the goodwill and determination of the negotiators. The agreement could enter into force in three to four years from now, given the time needed for ratification in Member States' parliaments. I should like to comment very briefly on a number of other points in the draft resolution. We accept that the agreement should to a certain extent serve as an example for other such agreements, although obviously we will also want to take account of the fact that we are dealing with different countries, each of which has its own identity and its own concerns. I share the wide-spread concern that we should treat each country on its merits and not shackle everyone to the pace of the slowest in the development of relations with the Union. That has never been the intention. The very fact that negotiations are beginning first with FYROM, before all the others, is evidence that we can and do differentiate. On the provision of regional aid referred to in the report we agree that our technical and financial assistance should go in part to projects having a cross-border or regional dimension. We agree that there should be an evolutionary clause on the prospect of EU membership contained in the stabilisation and association agreement. It will reflect the European Union's position on its relations with the countries of the western Balkans as set out in the Cologne European Council conclusions. We strongly agree on the need to decentralise our assistance programmes to the maximum possible extent. As for the arrangements covering European Union assistance to the western Balkans, Members will be aware that we are drawing up a new regulation to simplify and streamline their management and to put everything under one regulation. I am aware that there is concern in FYROM and elsewhere at the end of the PHARE programme in these countries and, especially, at the loss of association with the PHARE name. I note with considerable concern what Members say on this score. I will take another look at the issue, although I should point out that having two PHARE programmes up and running risks real confusion. I want to stress, however, that whatever the programme is called, our commitment to the integration of FYROM and its neighbours into the European family is stronger than ever. In general I trust that Members of this House will share my pleasure that Macedonia has reached this stage relatively rapidly. I hope that the other countries of the region will redouble their efforts to make similar progress. I look forward to many similar debates to this over the next few years marking, I hope, the success of what we are trying to do in the Balkans which, for me, remains the single most important litmus-test of what Europe is able to do on its own doorstep. Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00 p.m.	it
Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach. However, I should like to ask a slightly different question. We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year. Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter? It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process. I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has. Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate? It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is. I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument. There is no contradiction between the two. The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter. I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here. Question No 40 by (H-0095/00): Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria. Therefore, will the Commission state when they intend to propose under Article 7.1 that there is 'the existence of a serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6.1.' , and urge the Council acting by qualified majority to suspend certain rights deriving from the application of this Treaty to Austria including the voting rights of the representative of Austria in the Council? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to begin my answer by reminding you of the position adopted by the Commission with regard to the formation of the new Austrian Government. This was reiterated this morning in President Romano Prodi' s speech on that government which includes Ministers from Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party. I am referring ,of course, to the statement made by the Commission on 1 February 2000, the basic elements of which I would like to restate.	es
I believe that it is important for the Community initiative to be able to begin on time and therefore for the report to receive overwhelming support so that the Commission is also obliged to take into consideration the constructive proposals made by the European Parliament, because Parliament put the appropriations for EQUAL in the reserve precisely so as to ensure that Members' ideas were also reflected in this Community initiative. In this connection, the European Parliament is also justified in insisting that it should be possible to amend the thematic priorities only after a further hearing in Parliament. EQUAL should live up to its name, and this is my firm intention. It should provide equal opportunities for all those at a disadvantage in the European Union. It should prevent society from splintering. It should prevent exclusion from being part of everyday life. Everyone should be given the opportunity to benefit here from a common initiative regardless of their age, gender or origin. That is my intention and I would ask the House to give this report overwhelming support! Madam President, it is in itself an achievement that we are having this debate on the new URBAN Community initiative and it is an achievement that I am here tonight because Air France cancelled my flight at 2.10 p.m. but I am here! Just a year ago when the Commission produced its proposals around Agenda 2000 it axed the URBAN initiative. Yet we as politicians knew that there was a groundswell of support for continuing this initiative into the year 2000. Parliament, therefore, can take credit for a successful lobbying campaign to put URBAN back on the agenda and get the Commission and Council to make a U-turn. Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy. In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a White Paper and an urban government taskforce is looking at the problems of urban communities. With eight out of ten people in Europe living in urban areas, it is right that we help our most deprived communities to tackle the all too familiar problems of deprivation, social exclusion, joblessness, crime, drug dependency and all the problems that are associated with that. For example, in my own region, in Manchester, the URBAN Community initiative has been a tremendous success. URBAN funds have been invested in one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in the UK, in Moss Side. The Millennium Youth Park project is helping to get young people re-engaged in regenerating their own community and in addition to support for small businesses and social policy we are beginning to see a turnaround of a very deprived urban community. The work of this URBAN agenda was then taken out to the wider community with an active communication and publicity campaign in local supermarkets and famous British pubs. This is the kind of good practice we would like to see extended across the EU in terms of communication and publicity. As regards the specific guidelines governing the initiative, they are broadly defined to give scope for local and regional diversity.	it
They also play a major role in maintaining links between people. As has been pointed out here on many occasions, is the postman not in fact the last point of contact in depopulated districts or divided communities, whether these are areas that are isolated geographically or the problem districts in our towns and cities? Let me cite the example of the initiative of the French postal service, which decided, for instance, to make interpreters and writers available to the public in post offices in problem urban areas. Without even mentioning the jobs in related sectors, European public postal services today employ one and a half million operatives whose futures are clearly threatened by the spectre of radical, untrammelled liberalisation. The European Parliament was confident of reconciling openness to competition with the obligation to provide a universal service in a manner which safeguards jobs. We may congratulate ourselves on this, but we intend that this should continue and this is the reason why one can only deplore the fact that the European Parliament is today being excluded from the main decision-making process which will determine the fate of the postal sector in Europe. Indeed it is regrettable that to date - as the resolution we are debating points out - the Commission has not taken account of the resolution of 14 January 1999. That resolution called for the European Parliament to be involved in drawing up the planned measures and urged that the reliability of impact studies regarding liberalisation should be improved. These impact studies are necessary in order to assess the effects of any untrammelled liberalisation, not just on the economic organisation of the market, but also in terms of its human and social aspects. The delays in the Commission' s work will inevitably have a knock-on effect on the proposed timetable and the deadline of 2003 must certainly be called into question. By defining a sector reserved for public postal services, on the basis of weight and price limits, the postal service directive would clear the way for controlled liberalisation in phases. The sudden reduction of these limits poses a threat to the balance between the obligation to provide a public service and economic viability for postal services. Against a background of globalisation, where the rationale of profitability and profit is coming increasingly into conflict with the wish to achieve both a balance between regions and social cohesion, we must here, as a matter of urgency, reiterate our commitment to European public service, whether it be, today, the postal service or, tomorrow, the rail service or, the day after that, the health service. Mr President, I rise as other Scottish Members of this House, representatives of Scotland, to protest against anything that lead to a decline in the quality of rural life in remote parts. The postal service and the post office are a vital feature of life in rural communities throughout Europe and not least in Scotland. It would be a disaster if action were deliberately, or even inadvertently, taken which had the effect of damaging that. I do not believe that it is anybody' s intention to do so. I do not believe that the Commission has set out to make war upon the islands of Scotland or Greece. But they might accidentally do great damage. The point is to determine at what speed and by what methods the gradual liberalisation of the postal services should take place.	it
Tourism is a social, economic and cultural phenomenon which affects most European citizens, either as the recipients or the providers of a wide variety of services. Every year, nearly 200 million Europeans leave their homes for a short time in order to travel, usually to other countries in Europe. Moreover, Europe is still the main destination for tourists from third countries, even though it faces increasingly stiff competition and an increasingly diversified and attractive range of products. Since the Treaties contain no specific legal basis for a real Community tourism policy, the European Union must help to improve and encourage cooperation in this sector, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity, in order to take practical advantage of the potential which tourism offers in terms of employment. Vocational training and a mobile workforce are important tools in the strategy to fight unemployment in Europe especially, as far as tourist service providers are concerned, in meeting multicultural demands and ensuring that services are tailored to customers. Employment in the tourism sector is often highly seasonal and precarious, thereby hampering its sustainable development. It is therefore even more urgent that we acquire and disseminate managerial and technological skills in order to promote new means of production and a supply of tourism which reflects market developments as closely as possible. As the report notes, the adoption by the Member States of tax incentives for SMEs in order to reduce labour costs would be an excellent way of promoting growth in employment in labour-intensive sectors and, consequently, in the tourism sector. This sector of activity is also a deciding factor in the economic and social development of less favoured regions, especially the most remote and island regions, which have undisputed assets in this area. Let us not forget that, in the most remote regions, tourism is the most important industry in terms of income. The income and employment generated by tourism help enormously in reducing imbalances and encouraging their economies to converge with the average rate of growth in the Community. In addition, tourism can promote a certain cultural and economic rapprochement, insofar as it makes us more aware of other European cultures and thus helps respect for European ways of life to develop. It goes without saying, therefore, that tourism, developed rationally in the long term, should represent a sustainable source of income for local economies, while safeguarding and enhancing the value of the rural, cultural, historical and environmental heritage. I should like to close by stressing the essential role which the European Union should play in promoting new forms of tourism in new places which will allow continental Europeans to discover the most far-flung destinations in Europe, namely the most remote regions. Mr President, we are having a major debate on a text of very little substance. The basic document is really no more than a Commission communication which embraces the conclusions and recommendations of a high level group on tourism and employment. Not only is there very little substance but this is also a rather old document dating from 28 April 1999 which therefore makes it nearly a year old.	fr
I would like to appeal to those Ministers not to cast doubt upon that agreement which was really very difficult to reach. I would like to ask the Commission - and I am glad that Commissioner Solbes is here with us this evening - to present us in time with this multiannual finance programme, with the corresponding report, requested by Parliament, so that it may be taken into account when the preliminary draft of the next budget is drawn up, as we have been promised. Lastly, I would like to insist that, although we have agreed to EUR 35 million now, we know that this is a stopgap solution and that it is not enough, and we should therefore reach an agreement as soon as possible on the multiannual reconstruction programme for Kosovo, which is so badly needed. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need. The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there. However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process. Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents. Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions. I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future. It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this. However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here. One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims. In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres. Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into. This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations. It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected. This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there. This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence. We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators. Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there.	it
I would like to ask what new steps the Council can take to safeguard their interests in the forthcoming world trade talks, in particular, against the ranch and factory-style production of the USA and New Zealand where economies of scale make competitive family farming for European farmers extremely difficult and where, of course, European standards of food safety do not apply. I completely understand your concerns, and I feel that there is a need for effort and a certain degree of consistency within the European Union itself on this issue. We also have to think of the consequences, especially in terms of financing and compensating farmers. Nevertheless, as you know, this issue is now in the hands of the European Commission and it will have to take this further. The Council' s ability to intervene in this matter is strictly limited. Mr President, I too would like to welcome the President-in-Office to the Chamber. But I do not think he answered my question with regard specifically to tackling homelessness and housing and whether the Portuguese Presidency would be willing to meet the non-governmental organisations actively involved in this field. I appreciate and fully support his point on the need for multiple policies and a multi-disciplinary approach and also the need to combat the underlying causes of exclusion which can lead to homelessness and include the problem of drug dependency. My specific question concerns the problem of homelessness and whether a new presidency could take a new initiative to try to overcome some of the difficulties the President-in-Office alluded to with regard to support at intergovernmental level. I feel this is one area where Europe can play a very active role, even if only in providing the conduit for exchange of experience and best practice among the Member States. Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them. We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme. We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency. It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action. Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening.	fr
What is, on the other hand, absolutely necessary is to have a bare minimum of set rules that are valid within the Community, and which clearly provide as many additional safeguards as possible, and will also provide guarantees with a view to enlargement. My thoughts turn to what may become of this Community, of these conventions and judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country such as Turkey became a member of the Union. It would truly perplex me. We need a corpus iuris - as everyone has said - and common rules, especially procedural ones, which guarantee the rule of common law throughout the Community. It is clear that this is primarily an issue for the IGC and one that addresses an aspiration to which this Parliament can only make a limited contribution in as much as everything depends on the Council and the Commission. I believe that this first half of the year, in which we have a Commissioner from Portugal and Portuguese Presidency of the Council, provides an excellent opportunity to give an initial spur to this shared aspiration. It is precisely for this reason that we are in favour of adopting Amendments Nos 78 and 79, which already prefigure a minimum of set rules on interceptions and on video conferences. On the one hand, we eagerly await the successful outcome of this vote, precisely so that this convention - which, I repeat, already sets minimum rules - is not stripped of all meaning, while on the other hand we are also looking forward to any form of proposal that may arrive from the Commission with a view to definitively putting into effect this minimum Community law. Mr President, confronted with the burgeoning phenomenon of organised crime at international level, the Member States must surely cooperate with one another as much as possible. Indeed, they must set in place the institutional conditions needed to launch a tangible and efficient cooperation process in the field of law - a process that must nevertheless cover all the stages needed to prevent the untimely impositions that are detrimental to legitimate national prescriptions in the field of justice, over which Member States have sovereign powers, and above all to prevent impositions that result in riding roughshod over basic civil rights. We must therefore proceed with caution with regard to a document like the one from the Council which, as the rapporteur himself has underlined, now claims, after years of discussion, to have found a universal solution in the space of a few months. Furthermore - and I agree with the assessment made by Mr Di Pietro - the Council' s text would appear to be overladen with contradictions, inconsistent propositions and omissions. It is clear that the justice sector, more than any other, cannot be handled in an inconsistent or contradictory manner. It is the opinion of our Group that even the report, considered as a whole, would be the subject of much debate, notwithstanding the incorporation of certain corrective amendments that take into account the safeguarding of personal liberty and respect for national sovereignties. The report contains arguments that are too disparate, which do not link together smoothly, and everything thus hinges on approximations. We will, in conclusion, vote against this report, while stressing that the Europe to which we aspire is a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that call for gradual and responsible discussion, as well as very serious examination. We must first establish general rules and institutional certainties. Only then will we be able to institute actual conventions.	it
Lastly, I would like to stress the issue of liability. Not only in terms of maximum sums insured, which I believe should be similar to those in the United States. We have set a figure of USD 180 million; in the United States they are talking about USD 1 billion as a maximum ceiling for covering claims payments. I believe we have to increase the current amount so as to move closer to levels in the United States, but that we also have to reconsider the sums insured on vessels and, therefore, the liability of shipowners, and also to hold liable those who charter ships, which is to say the owners of the cargo. Unless we require that the owners of the cargo be held liable, we will never, in my opinion, resolve these problems. I will end now. I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions. But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done. As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety. The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers. Thank you very much, Commissioner. We have taken good note of your intentions. I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. Storms in Europe The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe. Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them. In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2. I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it. In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid. We should therefore put this situation right immediately. You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one. Let me explain. I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest. Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss. We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more.	de
However, a great deal of attention must be paid to its viability. Consideration must then be given to natural background emissions which cannot be influenced, as well as diffused emissions which are difficult to control, and which pollute the water quite substantially. Mr President, we need to get used to the idea in the 21st century that we have to show water a completely new respect. In the 20th century, water was merely a free evacuation and disposal system for poisonous substances, special waste, chemicals and so on. And we can already see the consequences! We need to rethink and recognise that water is our most important asset and that our responsibility towards it goes far beyond the present generation. The directive must be negotiated accordingly and our citizens must be able to understand what we or rather what the Commission is planning here. In the final analysis, water protection is not just a social question, it is a decisive social question, which is why the polluter pays principle must be applied more rigorously as otherwise we all bear the consequences. Given the advanced state of pollution of water resources, it is important not just to maintain the status quo but to ensure during the vote tomorrow that we achieve genuine quality improvements. Mr President, it must be some six years ago now that Mr Karl-Heinz Florenz, assisted by Mrs Ursula Schleicher, put in a request and managed to overhaul the water policy in its entirety. It is not an easy topic and, in my opinion, the efforts made by Mrs Lienemann are very laudable indeed. The decision-making process concerning this framework directive on water has reached a crucial stage. The topic has been brought under the codecision procedure and as a result, we have been able to draft important, more stringent legislation as early on as at first reading. In fact, the common position which was issued at the end of last year was already a major improvement on the original proposal. It is also very hard to adopt policy in this respect because the discrepancies are so huge. I would also address the Spanish Member in this respect: in the North of Europe, we often face floods, but also polluted water, from industry, whilst the problem facing the Members in the South is often related to transporting water over long distances, simply to supply drinking water or water for agriculture. I would like to enter into the two elements of this topic in more detail. I would first of all like to focus on quality. The Netherlands is significantly affected by the European water policy. A very important component, to wit, one third of our drinking water, is extracted from surface water in the Netherlands. The Netherlands is located downstream, in a delta, which means that the quality of the surface water which heads our way is of key importance. Another important point of discussion is the standardisation of water quality. In a number of amendments, the proposed standards and especially the OSPAR standard for 2020 are called into question.	es
A new feature of the URBAN II initiative is that it has been tailored to small cities or parts of cities. This is important because it is precisely small cities which often find it harder to access aid. And yet the problems which give rise to the urgent need for regeneration can be particularly acute precisely in cities of this kind and thus have a proportionally adverse effect. To increase the effectiveness of individual measures the number of projects for URBAN II has been limited to 50. I think that it is important not to stick rigidly to this arbitrary quantitative restriction and instead to leave it to the Member States to decide between how many projects they each wish to divide the support funds to which they are entitled. In any case it is necessary to ensure that in small Member States in particular it is not only areas of large cities which are again in receipt of the support. There URBAN II would only be a drop in the ocean; its success would be doubtful and the whole thing would be a flop. Just as important in my view is not to broaden the selection criteria for URBAN II too much and thus water them down. It is precisely a strictly defined list of criteria which is essential if the programmes which are funded are to be models and be transferable to other problem cities in the future. From my own experience of local government in an old industrialised region beset with problems, I should like, in conclusion, to ask for your particular support, ladies and gentlemen, for two points in the report which alongside the social policy aspects are, I believe, essential. Firstly, environmental protection is essential for sustainable urban development and the inclusion of this aspect should therefore be a general requirement for a project to receive funding. Secondly, preventing and combating routine urban crime and crime related to drug dealing must start at local level. These are essential steps towards increasing the quality of urban life and must therefore also play a central role in the URBAN II initiative. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to thank the rapporteurs, who have managed to produce excellent reports in just a short time. However, criticism has been voiced within my group over the timing of the preparatory work of the committee. The reports are late, and, in addition, they were very hastily discussed by the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism. A good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and shortcomings of the earlier programmes was therefore lost. Our group is keen to stress the importance of cross-border activity under the INTERREG programme and especially cooperation focusing on areas outside the European Union. Such important areas include the Balkans and the Adriatic region, but, in my opinion, we should not ignore cooperation with Russia either. Our group would once again like to raise the issue of the practical monitoring of funds and emphasise the importance of better coordination of the INTERREG, TACIS, ISPA and PHARE programmes.	es
The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem. However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC, In my own country, mythology tells of the teeming hordes of faceless Brussels bureaucrats but it never mentions the number of European judges. There are less than three dozen at the apex of the European judicial order - hardly an overload given the responsibility of their tasks at the heart of the European legal system. The extent of their importance can be seen in the political implications of the delay in resolving the outstanding Anglo/French dispute over British beef which has caused such anger in my country and such frustration with the workings of the Union' s disputes resolution procedures. This has been compounded, so some who advise me believe, by the Rules of Procedure in the French courts which make it well nigh impossible for non-French nationals to proceed against the French Government. Certainly it is perceived de facto to be impossible. This contrasts most unfavourably with the United Kingdom courts where Spanish fishermen successfully brought an action against the United Kingdom Government in circumstances which were very comparable. What is happening in France, Mr President, appears prima facie to be a case of discrimination against other EU nationals on grounds of nationality and as such to be in breach of the Treaties. I would therefore like to ask the Commissioner, who was kind enough to make some comments about my remarks in the previous debate, to look into this and to report back to Parliament and to me their findings. I would be grateful if the Commissioner could confirm in his final remarks that he will do this. Mr President, on behalf of Commission President, Mr Prodi, I would like to respond as follows. The Commission has taken note of the position adopted today by the European Parliament regarding the request made by the Court of Justice and the Court of First Instance. The purport of this request is, on the one hand, to transfer the assessment of certain appeals to the Court of First Instance, such appeals currently being within the exclusive scope of the Court of Justice and, on the other hand, to increase the number of judges at the Court of First Instance. May I add that, on behalf of the Commission, I listened with great interest to the pleas which have been made just now and that I have a great deal of sympathy for the unease which underlies these pleas. The unease is justified. It has been said more than once: justice delayed is justice denied. The Commission sympathises with these considerations. In the light of this sympathy, I would like to continue my response as follows. As your Parliament is aware, the Commission is convinced that, without fundamental reform, the Community judicial bodies run the risk - in the short term - of no longer being able to carry out their task within reasonable deadlines.	fr
President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week. This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law. The Commission is actively involved in those efforts. The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs. We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year. This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels. Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East. A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights. Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts. We also need to continue our support for economic reform and social development in Lebanon as a whole. A solution is needed to the Palestinian refugee problem - these are the largest group of refugees in the world, numbering nearly 5 million people - an indication of the enormous challenges ahead. We must support initiatives increasing the availability and improving the distribution and management of the region's very scarce water resources. Lastly, but maybe most importantly, we are encouraging closer regional cooperation in a number of areas, bringing all the countries concerned together in a joint endeavour to address their common problems. It is already apparent that the financial resources currently available for Community assistance to this part of the world will not be sufficient for the magnitude of support that will be required in the event of permanent peace. I want to underline that point. I wish insistently to remind the Council and, should it be necessary, Parliament, that we should not continue to allow a gap to develop between our rhetoric and what we are actually capable of doing. I repeat that a change in the politics of the Middle East will require a gear change in the support that we shall be asked and expected to provide. I hope I can add that we will want to provide that. We have made progress in recent months and weeks, as Mr Gama mentioned earlier. But it is inevitably going to be a tough process with difficulties and disappointments on the way. We will do all we can to help the process to a successful conclusion and to meet the obligations and challenges that will be created by that outcome. Lastly, I will repeat for some who have entered the Chamber in the last few minutes, what I said at the outset of my remarks: that I will not be able to stay until the end of the debate, largely as a result of having assumed that the debate was taking place this morning and having fixed a meeting on the Balkans for this evening.	it
Thirdly, the Military Staff will represent senior military personnel from the fifteen countries. Together with myself, this staff will form the civil and military secretariat whose task will be to prepare, with the assistance of the Military Committee, any operation needing to be organised in due course in the context of crisis management within the European Union. This crisis management will not be a strictly military affair but the military representatives and the Military Committee will be responsible for advising on the logistics of any humanitarian operations which may require the involvement of military forces. Mozambique is surely an excellent current example of how intervention may be required in terms of military logistics, not for military purposes, but with strictly humanitarian ends. We are therefore working diligently in this respect. Madam President, if, a few months ago when I had the pleasure of appearing before you for the first time, I had told you that I would be able to announce on 1 March 2000 that the first meeting of the Political Committee had been held today, that the Military Committee would be up and running within a week after that and that tomorrow the first members of the Military Staff would start to arrive at the building which we are to use, many of you would surely have thought that the High Representative was going mad. We are not mad. What we have done is to work long and hard, with determination and, without a shadow of a doubt, with the support not only of yourselves but also of the Heads of State and Government of the countries which you represent. Few initiatives within the European Union can have been progressed with such determination, drive and commitment as has been achieved in crisis management since Helsinki. In less than two months we have established the mechanics for cooperation with the Commission. I must thank Commissioner Patten who is here today for his support and the tremendous energy that he has also invested in trying to ensure that all these issues could be settled in such a short time. I will now move on to the second issue which I should like to discuss with you. We have already looked at the bodies which we have set up but we also have a fundamental obligation in terms of our credibility. Europe must be able to provide the military capacity to act in times of crisis. I must repeat that the European Union will not be using this military capacity to make war but to bring peace. It will participate in crisis management in order to help where there is war or situations of conflict, to re-establish calm and to take the heat out of these situations and also to avoid them. As you may recall, it was in this respect that the Helsinki Summit intelligently agreed to form a force of 60 000 soldiers from all the Member States. It will be possible for this force to be deployed at any given moment within 60 days, or two months, to prevent a crisis and for it to remain in action to prevent conflict for a period of one year.	de
Mr President, a year has not yet passed, but it is already clear that Parliament is going to evaluate the first and second reports differently. The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism. Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report. It is of no concern to the major groups in Parliament, nor to the majority of the trade unions, who are busy discussing the defence of European public administration, but, in practice, are occupied with the corporate protection of their own members, putting the wide powers afforded to them to dubious use. Trade union representatives sit on the Disciplinary Board and the Staff Regulations Committee, thereby making it impossible to remove disloyal officials and preserving the Staff Regulations in their fossilised state. Incomprehensibly, trade union representatives are also members of committees on competition, and I would not be surprised if union members were already members of OLAF, thereby placing this institution which should, at least formally, guarantee its impartiality, at great risk. I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information. Mr President, when it comes to putting its own house in order, the European Commission is in a Catch-22 situation. There is enormous pressure of expectation following the events that led to the resignation of the previous Commission. I sometimes have the impression that the more radical the proposals made here in this Chamber sound, the more applause they receive. There again, it is simply not possible to change situations once and for all with a few strokes of the pen, and the problems begin as soon as we have to start talking about implementation and getting down to brass tacks. This may explain why we experienced more difficulties than anticipated in the Committee on Budgetary Control as regards this issue. Nevertheless, the outcome is now on the table and there for all to see, and I would expressly like to thank Mr van Hulten for the work he has done on this report. Provided this report is not watered-down yet again by the adoption of amendments, it will afford us the opportunity to make clear and unambiguous demands of the Commission on a number of crucial points. Allow me to start with the most important demand. We do not want financial control to be abolished. The financial controller should still be able to make checks before funding commitments or payments are made, not in every case, but wherever uncertainties or risks arise. The Commission is sending out the wrong signals here, by renaming the Directorate-General for Financial Control as the Directorate-General for Audits, for example. It may well be easy enough to change the Commission' s organisation chart but it is a different matter when it comes to the legal texts, particularly those relating to budgetary discipline.	it
Will you do everything in your power to ensure that a statute for assistants is adopted as soon as possible? Finally, will you make sure that in the meantime Parliament's rules are properly implemented and that assistants are paid, as they should be, on the basis of all the work they do for us? Without them we would not be able to function. Mr President, I also rise on a point of order. Are there any rules or regulations that govern demonstrations within the building of this Parliament, outside the doors of the Hemicycle, to ensure that MEPs are free to come into this Hemicycle to discharge their mandate? If there are such rules, who has the responsibility for enforcing them and what are they doing to discharge that responsibility? Mr President, I would like to take up the matter of the statute for assistants, which we have always considered to be a priority, and inform you that - as the Italian delegation of the group - in response to the invitation from the group leader, Mr Barón Crespo, we have forwarded the contracts that we drew up with the assistants to the Quaestors. I think that we need to make a tangible gesture in order to get a solution to this problem underway. I would therefore like to call on the Presidency of Parliament to consider that it might be appropriate for the Presidency itself to invite the Members to do likewise. Mr President, first of all let me say that I am in full support of a statute for assistants. Yesterday when I arrived in Parliament I was handed a document relating to a proposed demonstration by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament. As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me over the last six months - all exhibitions and such like are filtered first of all through the Comart committee of Parliament. To give a non-contentious example, no commercial exhibitions can be held here in Parliament for obvious reasons. Following a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would propose that they be allowed to hold a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly in the next month. But all exhibitions must be carried out in a way that do not interfere with the orderly running of Parliament. I signed a letter yesterday afternoon, in the meeting of the Bureau of Parliament, in which the assistants were informed of this. But I am also told that they were informed verbally of this decision by the Committee of Chairmen of Groups last Thursday, so they were fully aware of the decision. There is no problem with them telling us the way they feel, there is no problem with a possible meeting during Parliament's next part-session. But there was some misunderstanding, for they did receive a letter from somebody else that they felt gave them permission. But all exhibitions are in fact looked at first by the so-called Comart committee. As you can see we have many exhibitions around Parliament, whether they be about different countries or whatever. This is not an attempt to either censor or go against the very real and justifiable principle that we should have a statute for assistants. Thank you, Mrs Banotti. I think your intervention may clarify various points that were raised. Mr President, I wanted to point out an important matter of principle.	de
"As far as Amendment No 15 on the definition of the term ""self-employed"" is concerned, the Commission will, as I have already remarked, provide an adequate solution to accommodate the objections lodged. I would now like to move on to Lord Inglewood' s remark. He referred to United Kingdom border controls and I would like to say to him that Member States, and this includes the United Kingdom, are under no obligation at all to abolish or change controls at the existing borders. This applies, as already stated, to the United Kingdom and it also applies to Belgium, where it was recently of relevance. With regard to the remark made by Mr Karas, I am under the impression that he is talking about the possibility of people from Poland being used as employees in his country. The Commission would like to propose finding a solution to this problem which would then apply to all companies based in the European Union which employ staff from non-EU countries. The question is, furthermore, one of whether the two cases should be treated in the same way. In my opinion, this is an issue which belongs to the debate on the enlargement of the European Union and perhaps not to the present debate. On behalf of the Commission, I would be more than happy to make myself available to Mr Karas in case he would like further information on this genuinely important point. I will keep myself free in this connection. Finally, I would like to thank Parliament for the very constructive debate on the key aspects of these proposals and, in particular, of course, the rapporteur, Mrs Berger. Thank you very much, Commissioner Bolkestein. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00 a.m. Court of First Instance Mr President, I would like to begin by congratulating the rapporteur on a report, which, on reading it, gives the impression of simply confirming and accepting the Council' s draft decision. However, this report is based on long and effective work which has already produced certain results, such as the incorporation into the Finnish Presidency' s document of 7 December 1999 of the commitment to widen the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference to include a study of the future modification of the organisation, composition and competences of the Community Courts. For this reason, I would like to express my appreciation for the work carried out by Vice-President Marinho. Mr President, the reform of the Community judicial system has become an essential requirement if, in the future, we intend justice to be done within reasonable time scales, and if, in the future, the European Union wishes to have a judicial system which is equal to the political project which we have embarked upon. Today - and I must say this with pride and satisfaction - this Parliament has had a good opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which we Europeans believe that the European political project is much more than just an internal market, and that it is based much more on principles than on economic interests."	es
"Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life. A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected. We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral. I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed. Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force. A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules. In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well. But Europe is changing. The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States. The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy. It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy. This is not in question. Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation. How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara? This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given. It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience. In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy. This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market. The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term ""foolhardy,"" and this is not allowed. Uniformity needs to be worked on. Think of specialist, national courts with the option of direct appeal to a special competition court at the European Court. This special court in Luxembourg is necessary in order to build up broad expertise. Moreover, due to the immense economic and social interests involved, we cannot afford to wait for a judgement to be pronounced two years after the event, as is now quite normal. What is the Commissioner' s opinion of this? I would like to finish off by making an important point for small and medium-sized businesses. In order to grant small and medium-sized companies greater security, the European Commission itself needs to draw up an exemption regulation for small and medium-sized businesses so that, alongside vertical exemptions, horizontal exemptions will also be possible. Through cooperation, small, independent firms must be able to stand up to the large chains. It cannot be the aim of European competition policy to make life impossible for small businesses."	it
There is no justification in our society for terrorist acts such as the one which took the lives of Fernando Buesa and Jorge Díez, particularly when the former was a freely elected representative of the Basque people. We pray that these are the last victims in a process which, as you said, Madam President, has seen much barbarism. We pray that a way forward can be found which will allow the Basque people to live together in peace. Madam President, on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, I must add my voice to those of my colleagues who have expressed their grief at the truly perverse and cruel outrage which has occurred in the Basque Country. We send our condolences to the families of the victims and emphatically condemn these acts which have been going on for so long and which must stop. The terrorist organisation ETA has, in its time, killed police officers and soldiers. It has placed a bomb in a supermarket and killed men, women and children. In the streets of Madrid it has killed a general, Quintana Lacaci, who defended democracy at the time of the attempted coup of 1981. It has assassinated the spokesman of the Popular Party in the town council of San Sebastián, Gregorio Ordóñez. It has been to the lecture room of the university professor in Constitutional Law, Francisco Tomás y Valiente, and killed him in cold blood. Now, just a few days ago, in the same odious way in which it assassinated Admiral Blanco, it has killed the socialist MP and spokesman in the Vitoria parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez, of the Basque police force. ETA must be condemned. However, those who support and express understanding for these attacks must also be condemned. There is no point continuing to ask these people and organisations to go down the democratic road. We must appeal to the whole of society and particularly to the democratic parties, whether they are national or nationalist, and no matter how pro- or anti-European they are. It is regrettable that there are organisations and people who are saying nothing or simply regretting the deaths as if they were the result of a road traffic accident. All European democrats in this House must join together to send a message to the Basque Country that it is time to put an end to the division and killing. It is time to share the Basque Country, Spain and Europe. This, Madam President, is the only way forward which we therefore fully support. Madam President, on behalf of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group, I would like to express our sorrow for the victims and our rejection of terrorism and those who defend it. For the friends and relatives of the victims this is a human tragedy and for their political families it is a political tragedy, but I feel that we are also witnessing a cultural tragedy, in that the culture of death and of violence is constantly gaining ground against the culture of respect for others, democracy and democratic life.	it
I have absolutely no doubt about this and I believe it is an essential point. In this regard, Madam President, I would like to say that we should remain aware and watch our language. Last week, the new Minister for Finance of the Austrian coalition described the Austrian Parliament as a farce and a theatre. Those of us who have had to live under a dictatorship know of the existence of dictatorships with cardboard governments. There can be no democracy without a living parliament. I believe that this type of language is extremely dangerous and I would like to condemn it here and now. With regard to the four great priorities which President Prodi systematically refers to and with regard to his analysis of the challenges facing us, I would say that we are very much in agreement. Nevertheless, I would point out to the Commission that, as far as the Socialist Group is concerned, there has been a change of priorities. We understand that the first priority is the economic and social agenda, which also includes what is known as 'quality of life' priorities, that is to say, the rights of citizens as consumers and as people, in relation to those questions which we always talk about, but never give sufficient priority to, that is, the European social model and its adaptation to the new circumstances, consumer rights, respect for the environment and sustainable development. When speaking of the commitment to full employment, we have to bear in mind that, these days, full employment does not mean what it meant in the era of Beveridge at the end of the Second World War, that is to say, employment for the male head of the household. We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme. This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat. This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics. I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue. In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress. With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000. Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision? The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential. With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms.	de
My group is pleased that the Social Affairs Council gave the go-ahead for a better cooperation strategy as early on as the end of last year and that, in fact, a group of high-ranking officials has already been commissioned to submit to the Council an initial report by June 2000. However, we, the Parliament and, in particular, the group of the Social Democrats, want Lisbon to go one step further now. It is of great importance that, in our fellow MEP' s report, this European Parliament advocates a true European strategy of social convergence, based on what provisions have been made for employment via the so-called Luxembourg strategy, that is to say it should encompass common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance evaluations. We believe that this course of action is ambitious, yet achievable. Needless to say, it is clear that harmonisation of social security is not viable at European level. The financial and organisational systems vary too greatly for this, and this is also an important reason why social protection has only just been put on the European agenda, and why, in fact, scenarios such as Danny Peters' thirteenth Member State or the European social snake have scarcely got off the ground. But this new course of action is very exciting. The employment strategy has proved that it can function well and social convergence is also necessary, for our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and in an EMU era, social security systems would otherwise threaten to fall prey to social competition. But let me make one thing clear on behalf of my group: social convergence strategies should not be an alternative to social legislation. They can merely serve as an extremely useful complement to what we are developing and expecting from the Commission in terms of social legislation. I think that it also a good thing if, moreover, the European Parliament tried to convince the Council to substantiate the common strategy as early on as in Lisbon and to launch an annual procedure to reduce poverty levels no later than at the beginning of 2001. I am pleased about the fact that the European Parliament supports my group' s idea and we hope, Commissioner, that we can also count on your support. Finally, we urge the European Parliament, both sides of industry and social NGOs to be closely involved in this process. The success of this strategy hinges on a broad and democratic base and we hope that we can count on your support. Mr President, the four chief objectives which the EU countries' governments endorsed in November of last year and which were mentioned earlier here today were as follows: that care should be taken to ensure that it is worthwhile working and guaranteeing oneself a secure income; that pensions should be guaranteed and pension arrangements made sustainable; that social integration should be promoted; and that sustainable, high-quality health care should be guaranteed. These are four goals which have been worded in such broad terms that everyone must be able to support them. Having a group of high-ranking officials as the focal point for the pooling of experience and for the coordination and evaluation of the ways in which social and labour market policies are being developed is also something we can all benefit from.	fr
Clearly the Commission has given some consideration to this problem and I am pleased that these reports which have been produced so far have looked carefully at the issue. But I would like to point out that the concern with depleted uranium weapons is about the way in which they are used. This uranium becomes air-borne, is inhaled and could now be effectively carried by members of the population in Kosovo with rather more long-term effects than it has been possible to establish so far. This seems to be the pattern of events that has emerged after the use of depleted uranium weapons in the Gulf war. I would therefore ask the Commission if it would wish to consider continuation of monitoring and for what length of time they might consider monitoring in future to see the long-term effects, not just of depleted uranium weapons but of some of the other effects on the environment that we do know have occurred at least in a localised way within Kosovo? How long will you continue to monitor the effects of these weapons? Thank you, Mr Bowe, for that question. We have to state again that there is still no confirmation that depleted uranium was used in the conflict and no depleted uranium has been detected in the clean-up of Kosovo. But those symptoms and those problems that you mentioned could be there and that could be the effect of the use of depleted uranium. That is also mentioned in the report. No transboundary effects have been detected and most of the weapons will have been used on the territory of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The problem is that the current political isolation of the country means that access to this area is restricted. A big responsibility rests with the United Nations because they are addressed with this report, so they have to take responsibility. But through this regional and environmental reconstruction plan we can continue the monitoring and the assistance we can give and that is, for the time being, the kind of frame we can use for the work of the European Union. It is important to follow up and it gives the Member States, as well as the United Nations and the Commission, something to think about when it is a matter concerning military secrets and their effects on the environment. It also has a long-term effect on thinking when it comes to the use of these sorts of weapons. Mr President, Commissioner, in a few months' time, hundreds of thousands of holidaymakers will again head for the Adriatic Coast to spend their summer holiday. We know from media reports that bombs and weapons were dumped just off the coast. Are you able to confirm that holidaymakers will be able to swim safely in the Adriatic this summer, and are there any measures in the pipeline for ascertaining what the dangers might be in this respect? I wish I could give guarantees for many things but unfortunately I am not able to. We make our judgements from reports like this and the missions we send to check on things like this.	it
May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market. We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products. If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany. That is indeed distortion of the internal market. If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe. As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another. But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way. This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen. Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Today we will take note of what you say and have a glass or two of Alsace wine, although we do not know how much tax is put on it, but I suppose it is a lot. Since the time allotted to Questions to the Commission has elapsed, Questions 55 to 114 will be replied to in writing. That concludes Questions to the Commission. (The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) Community policy in the field of water (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy. Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease. To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East. In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia. I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area. I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin. The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions. I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent.	es
And just as well, in my view. As you may be aware, in contrast with the cold Northern seas, the Mediterranean is a small, warm sea where there are very few, if any, schools of only one species of fish. In our opinion, the possibility put forward in the explanatory statement of this report of setting TACs in the Mediterranean is therefore inappropriate. Lastly, we would vote for the amendments tabled by the Confederal Group of the European United Left. We do believe that it is extremely important to give financial support to conventional fishing and craft trades and to boost the income of fishermen during periods when moratoria on fishing are in force: in short, we must make it possible to carry on a major, responsible economic activity while still ensuring proper respect for the environment. Mr President, first of all, I am pleased that the Katiforis report takes into consideration the multitude of factors responsible for the deterioration of the marine environment: pollution, unsupervised fishing, drilling platforms and pressure from the increasing use of coastal areas for urban development are potential sources of widescale damage to the environment in both coastal areas and offshore, and fishing is also a victim of this situation. There is therefore a need for an in-depth analysis of the relationship between fishing and the environment. The use of selective fishing gear which reduces incidental unwanted catches and limits the throwing of unwanted fish back into the sea is certainly essential, as is a reduction of the pressure from the fishing industry offshore, as well as in coastal waters. A reduction in the fishing capacity and in pressure from the fishing industry on fish stocks is not necessarily compatible with maintaining an outdated fleet and would limit modernisation. In addition to providing more appropriate conditions of safety and hygiene, the use of more modern vessels could also contribute to reducing certain major factors. Moreover, it is important to uphold the concept that it is not possible to make a surface categorisation of entire fishing sections as more environmentally friendly: in reality, in some cases, small-scale fishing has less of an impact on the environment and natural resources. I am also pleased that the report takes into consideration the possibility of starting a campaign for informing fishermen and consumers of the risks of exploiting fishing resources, and I also welcome the Commission' s request to propose the institution of a European award to be given to different categories of the industry and to all those who provide services and advice regarding responsible behaviour, in order to further the sustainable management of fish stocks and the conservation of marine life. Mr President, as a member of the Verts/ALE Group, but also as a Member of this Parliament for Galicia, I propose to use this intervention to enlarge upon two issues. I shall, of course, be brief. Firstly, fishery production and the conservation of marine life and resources are two sides of the same coin. Shipowners and fishermen from the countries most active in fishing are more concerned than anyone about respecting their means of living, for without it, the future of this sector cannot be guaranteed.	it
As far as we are concerned, they will be. We shall try to achieve a consensus on this matter. Question No 5 by (H-0785/99): Subject: Proposal for a regulation laying down the total admissible catches for specific fish populations for the year 2000, and the case of anchovies in particular The latest reports from the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea indicate that the current level of anchovy stocks in ICES zone VIII is critical. Have the Council of Fisheries Ministers and the Commission assessed the impact of transferring the Portuguese quota for ICES zones XI and X and CECAF zone 34.1.1 to France (5000 metric tonnes per year overfishing) on the ICES zone VIII anchovy stocks and their responsibility for the current situation of the anchovy stocks and the possible social and economic impact on this fisheries sector in the future? Does the Council believe that it is permissible to consolidate future overfishing which violates the originally established TAC of 33 000 metric tonnes per year, given the current evidence for the critical state of anchovy stocks? What measures does the Council intend to adopt, and when, with a view to taking proper account of the critical state of anchovy stocks, the aforesaid quota transfer and the principle of relative stability? Mr President, the Portuguese Presidency is extremely anxious to give a comprehensive answer to this question, particularly because it broaches an issue which concerns Portugal in a positive way, and I shall explain how. The Council is aware of the critical level of anchovy stocks in the Bay of Biscay to which Mr Ortuondo Larrea refers. Nevertheless, at the last Fisheries Council of 1999, held on 16 and 17 December, the Member States involved in this area of fishing, namely France, Spain and Portugal, considered that applying the precautionary principle which sets a TAC reduced from 5 000 tonnes to 2 000 tonnes, as the Commission proposed, was excessively cautious. A compromise solution was therefore reached in order to achieve a balance between the need to reduce the biological risks, that is the species of fish being affected, and the socio-economic problems caused by fishing limits. This was achieved by fixing the TAC at an intermediate level of 16 000 tonnes instead of the 33 000 set in 1999. It was also stipulated that this would be revised in the light of new scientific information on preserving species, of which we hope to see examples in the first six months of this year. As for the Southern stocks of anchovy in ICES zone IX, the TAC was fixed at 10 000 tonnes for the whole of 2000 as opposed to 13 000 tonnes in 1999. Fishing quota transfers between Portugal and France were reduced proportionally from 5 008 tonnes in 1999 to 3 000 tonnes in 2000, for fishing in French waters. I would like to state that this transfer will not increase the pressure of fishing on anchovy stocks overall, over the whole Community fishing area. In accordance with the principle of relative stability, 90% of stocks of anchovy in the Bay of Biscay are allocated to Spain and only 10% to France.	de
That is my judgement at the moment. It may be a matter for discussion here and elsewhere and I will listen to any suggestions that are made but my preliminary conclusion is that this Authority should be located centrally rather than on the periphery. Colleagues, I am in a very difficult position because I cannot change the agenda. I would suggest to you to take this matter up with your political groups and raise it in the Conference of Presidents. If you feel that these sessions after a Commission statement are important, I would suggest that we require more time than the half-hour that is allocated to them. On this occasion we have had six minutes of questions from the floor of the House and we have had 29 minutes of response by the Commissioner, and his statement. As you can see, half-an-hour is not really anything like enough time for such a session. I hope you might discuss this in your political groups so that we can have a better structured session with the Commission on such future occasions. That concludes the debate. Question Time (Commission) The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Commission. We will dedicate approximately one hour and fifteen minutes to Question Time. We will cut back our time a little because the interpreters are working today in continuous session. Mr Purvis has the floor for a procedural motion. I object to the fact that we are cutting back the time for Question Time; it is one of the few occasions when backbenchers have a chance to get their time on the floor and I do ask you to extend it to one and a half hours as is on the agenda. That is the agenda and I think that we should stick to the agenda. The fact is that the agenda said that we would begin at 5.30 p.m., and you can see the clock. I hope that we do not go on into the evening session in any event. First Part Question No 28 by (H-0781/99): Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes. Turkey's nuclear plans ? which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region ? prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan. What steps will the Commission take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget?	fr
The treatment of the Native Americans in many respects flies in the face of the most fundamental human rights. The account of the Dineh Indians is telling. With the discovery and, certainly, the exploitation of black gold - and, later on, uranium and oil - all possible means were used to remove these people from their land and to send them to regions with few prospects other than poverty, hardship and contamination. The area in Arizona which is to be the New Land for the Dineh Indians was hit in 1979 by the worst nuclear disaster in US history. It is now the intention to send the last 4 000 Dineh Indians to this land. The fight of these Indians is being backed by more than 250 NGOs and, thanks to the efforts of the Belgian 'Mother Earth' organisation, we are being kept informed of this situation. This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it. They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country. Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life. There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things. The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians. They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years. They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years. The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries. The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples. This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms. The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income. The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry. Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives. The population was not allowed any input. This resembles a kind of trade in human beings. The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium. After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas.	fr
I have two questions. Firstly, you mentioned that you will start a two-way dialogue with the citizens and I am already making a start with the 700 placement students at the European Commission. Do you intend to address the citizens via the media as well, that is to say via the television and Internet? My second question is of a critical nature. The European Commission has just issued a proposal on transparency. If I compare this with the transparency proposal which pertains to legislation in the Netherlands, then the European model is vastly overshadowed by the Dutch model, and that proposal has met with a lot of criticism in the Netherlands. My question is really: how do you intend to organise transparency with regard to the IGC, because the present directive is not a good example of this. Mrs Maij-Weggen, given that we are talking about ensuring transparency in the IGC, it is clear how business will be conducted and the negotiations are starting right now. The group of representatives is currently meeting in Brussels and I will try to join them as soon as possible. The documents will in the main be open working documents. Although the negotiation sessions which will take place throughout the year between ministers and the European Council will not be open to the media, I am committed, as I must be at this stage, to ensuring this transparency and reporting in the most appropriate arenas on these negotiations and the Commission' s viewpoint. I can confirm, and thank you for having asked me about this, that we will use all the most modern means, television in particular, to broadcast our public debates in each country and even across Europe. We will open an Internet forum and create permanent discussion forums. The Commissioners will undertake to respond rapidly to any questions raised. These are the modern means to be used. However, I believe we must also make the effort to get as close as possible to the people. Although this may be a rather Utopian ideal, I want a Commissioner, when he can, an MEP, a minister to attend public debates in all the regions of Europe. I have evidence that this is possible. The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions. Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible. Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say. I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding. He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner. I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign?	fr
One of the most significant transfers - the Tajo-Segura transfer - which has been in use for many years, almost 30 years, has an allowance of 658 hm3 per year. The largest volume transferred in one year has been 453 and the average volume over twenty years has been over 200. We cannot be accused of bad management. Is the Commissioner aware that, of this 263 hm3, we used 25 for irrigation on the left bank of the Levante, 30 for water supplies in the area of the Júcar, 7 for supplies in the southern area of the Júcar and the rest in the Segura, equally divided between supplies and irrigation? We are not doing a bad job of management. We cannot be prohibited from carrying out transfers when our economy and the development of our regions depend on it. I will not tackle the issue of quality and the best available technologies, because I believe that we will return to a discussion of this directive. Take good note: in this diverse Europe, which we are building in a spirit of mutual cooperation, we have to find diverse solutions, not single solutions. I therefore appeal to the common sense of the Commission, the Council and this House so that, when voting, they do not impose uniformity on the different countries of Europe in areas where subsidiarity is required. Commissioner, Andalusia is not Lapland. . (SV) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want, of course, to begin by thanking the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Lienemann for the ambitious and constructive work she has put into the present framework water directive. Water is one of our most important natural resources, as many speakers have already said. An ambitious and well-balanced European policy in the field of water is an important component of guaranteed sustainable development for Europe. Water is also one of the issues to which I shall be devoting particular attention during my term of office. I am pleased about the spirit of agreement which permeates the amendments that have been submitted to Parliament. Many of them are based upon the very constructive, informal discussions which have taken place between Parliament and the Council in connection with the first reading. Most of Parliament' s proposed amendments help improve the text and make it more ambitious. The Commission can approve 72 of the 108 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. Many of the amendments which Parliament has submitted show that reconciliation will be necessary. With a view to these forthcoming negotiations, I would therefore urge Parliament to vote in favour of an ambitious position. Firstly, I should like to mention some of my most important arguments. We now have the opportunity to put into practice those measures to which we agreed under the OSPAR Convention. Rather than make these objectives legally binding, we must consider their political nature. This is also reflected in many of Parliament' s amendments. Where water charges are concerned, the present directive will constitute Europe' s water policy for the next three decades. It is our duty to ensure from the very start that the present directive provides the right incentives and the proper driving force for a pricing system and an efficient structure of charges which will improve our environment in a cost-effective way.	de
Finally, our resolution clearly stipulates that it is absolutely essential, in matters of maritime safety, to break out of this downward spiral of widespread irresponsibility, this pernicious system of mutual paralysis wherein States dump responsibility onto the Union, and the Union dumps it on the States, and in the end, the polluters are the only winners. Everyone must play their own part. The Commission, which, for once, has not followed the lead of the Americans even though it might have been beneficial in this case, should establish a basis for maritime safety at the earliest possible opportunity. This basis must include minimum conditions for access to Community waters and ports with regard to the age and characteristics of vessels; a general principle of environmental responsibility making it possible to determine the liability of the various operators, and particularly that of the charterer, and to impose heavy penalties. The Commission should ensure the coordination of information. It should not be afraid to confront the lax attitude of some major ports or major shipowners, and should make the issue of flags of convenience a central concern in the negotiations with Malta and Cyprus. Let me remind you that the Erika was registered in Valletta. All the same, States must clearly not shift their own essential responsibility onto the Union: the safety of all concerned is conditional upon the standards and effectiveness of inspection by the port State (and the resources made available for this). We must, and shall, remain particularly vigilant in the months to come in order to ensure that the victims who bear none of the responsibility whatsoever for this disaster receive compensation in full from the polluter, and to ensure that this time we do in fact learn the lessons from the oil slick in terms of maritime safety, so that polluters are deterred once and for all from gambling with the lives of our coastal populations. The most effective form of prevention is to ensure that any potential polluter is made liable to extremely heavy financial penalties. Katiforis report (A5-0017/2000) We agree that the fishing industry has the most to gain from promoting respect for the marine environment. We must nevertheless bear in mind that there are many factors that contribute to damaging marine areas, such as contamination and pollution by oil tankers and other maritime transport, industrial activity, the pressure of human activity on coastal waters and, of course, uncontrolled fishing activity. It is worth emphasising, however, that small-scale coastal fishing is a good example of how fishing activity can be combined with sustainable development that does not threaten the marine environment. We feel that it is possible to create a fisheries management policy based on conserving the marine environment which is compatible with the interests of fishing communities. But in order for this to happen, we must specifically take account of the fact that there is a correlation between income from fishing and an increase in fishing effort. It is therefore necessary to adopt measures under the common fisheries policy and to provide appropriate financial resources to guarantee the income of those who depend entirely on fishing for their livelihood, such as fishermen, particularly at times when fishing activity is suspended or reduced.	es
"Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough. My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma. Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma. I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion. For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest. And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action. Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma. There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention. In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn. Surely we cannot tolerate the fact that Mrs Aung San Sui Kyi feels completely left in the lurch, even by Europe. My request is, in fact, to put this country back on the top of the agenda. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office, Commissioner, economic clout cannot be the only factor that determines the European Union' s status in the world. One of the EU' s distinguishing features is our systematic approach to human rights, as exercised both within the Union and by our partners. The European Parliament has been at the forefront of the battle to promote and defend human rights, and it has succeeded in overcoming the limits imposed by self-interest and ""national interests"" , which are sometimes reflected in the positions adopted by the Member States and even by other European Union institutions. We can therefore safely say, for example, that the European Parliament has never allowed the situation in East Timor to be forgotten, which could have been the greatest obstacle to finding an equitable solution for its people, who always opposed occupation by Indonesia. By the same token we have recently opposed arms sales to Indonesia, a stance that the Council unfortunately did not take into account. But it is not just a question of preventing or putting a stop to sickening instances of aggression perpetrated by individuals or institutions against those in a weaker position. It is vital that when violations are committed, the perpetrators should not be able to act with impunity, whoever or wherever they may be - in Indonesia or Angola, in Cuba, China or Burma, whether the perpetrators are civilians or soldiers, humble foot-soldier or general or even a minister. Justice needs to be done in Indonesia. Justice needs to be done in East Timor. President Wahid needs our support to cope with the difficult situation he is faced with. The specific reference in this resolution to East Timor, on the initiative of the PPE Group, is a timely one. Someone must be held to account for the events that took place there, some of which I saw with my own eyes as a representative of this House; they cannot go unpunished."	fr
But I believe that we should do all we can to keep the transport of dangerous goods to a minimum, in all countries, whether they are transit countries or not. Mr President, I would firstly like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Koch, on his magnificent work and his positive cooperation with the Commission with regard to improving the texts and presenting this report and this proposal; in the end there is only one amendment on the requirements for the aptitude examination for safety advisers in the transport of dangerous goods by road, rail or inland waterway. We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent. The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question. Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport. As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end. The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day. In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety. In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved. Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport. But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem.	fr
And the Commission should be able to refuse new tasks if it does not also get the extra staff it needs. The staffing system is too rigid. There should be a more frequent rotation of employees, especially at the top of the hierarchy. It should also be much easier to sack inefficient and incompetent employees. I am therefore very pleased that the disciplinary procedure is to be reformed. After all, the very bad experiences so far with disciplinary proceedings show all too clearly how necessary it is that we carry out reforms. Mr President, Commissioners, first of all, I cannot help but reflect upon the fact that this is, on the whole, a Dutch-British-Scandinavian debate where the speakers are concerned. Perhaps this is a little worrying. I hope, like so many others, that the state of emergency in relations between the Commission and Parliament is on the way to being resolved. We must get away from the idea that we are rushing to put out a fire in one corner, only then to have to rush again to put out the next one. As Mr Blak said, we must instead establish a system with clear roles. First of all, we need tough regulations, which can be implemented. Codes of conduct and ethical committees are not enough. There need to be tough rules stating, among other things, what may be decentralised, what may be outsourced and what is independent. I find it a little worrying that people are clamouring for independence in this debate without defining what it is in relation to which there is to be independence and without defining what right of decision-making is to be exercised. What we need, then, are basic administrative regulations for the EU, for its institutions and for the EU in its relations with the Member States. These are what are missing. We have asked for a Public Prosecutor' s Office and criminal law, but we also need administrative law for the EU. We should make a good deal of progress if the Commission were to adopt, as binding regulations, the ombudsman' s proposal of a code of conduct for good administrative practice. The van Hulten report is a step in the right direction, but it is not enough. Secondly, we must also clarify our own auditing roles. The Court of Auditors is to monitor the extent to which actions are incompatible with the regulations, but it should not examine the expediency of a particular action. It is the European Parliament which is to carry out the political evaluation. We do not hunt down criminals. That is OLAF' s job. Tell me what national parliament, for example, is handed all preliminary investigation documents. Obstinate as I am, I also want to say that the regulations governing public access to official records must be clearly better than the draft which has been circulating on the Internet. Otherwise, we shall not get anywhere in this fight. Mr President, I would like to extend a warm thank you to the rapporteur for his report. I am pleased that I can address him now in Dutch, now that Mr Van den Berg has just done so. Otherwise I probably would have felt slightly guilty about this. I would like to say that this report represents a huge improvement, also with its amendments. I am from the Social Committee and rapporteurs on our committee are always proud to receive 100 amendments because then they know that they have tabled an interesting topic.	it
Böge report (A5-0023/2000) . (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union. This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species. What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie. What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis. I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie. A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic. Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement. It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions. The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard. As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence. It is up to us, as responsible Europeans, to prove that the single market and the free movement of goods and food safety are not mutually exclusive. Cederschiöld report (A5-0008/2000) Mr President, I voted for this initiative to amend the copyright legislation because I believe it is one of the most important sectors within the remit of the European Parliament. In my view, products of the mind are far more valuable than tangible products, namely, those that can be seen and touched. The fruits of the intellect and science, which are intangible, are of inestimable importance. Therefore, the European Community should be more energetic in providing practical encouragement, not just through upholding patents but through concessions and other forms of support for scientists who are striving, through the knowledge and experience they have acquired, to give future generations something better than that which they have today. . (DA) We oppose, on principle, the European Community' s entering into treaties on copyright law on behalf of the Member States.	de
"Coherence, consistency and universally good standards in a decentralised system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures. One is to ensure high quality training, another is to ensure that no Directorate-General can take over financial control responsibilities unless and until the auditor service is absolutely certain of the robustness of the system, another is the establishment of a central financial service, as honourable Members will see from the White Paper, to ensure that those standards are set and supervised, and there is also the additional belt and braces and boilersuit approach of having an effective and independent internal audit service.  I will not go into all the details in the course of a parliamentary answer of this kind but I am certain that on examination Mrs Theato will be able to see that in the details of the White Paper, there are very strong assurances. There will also be evidence of the fact that we have taken heed of the representations made in this House particularly in the Committee on Budgetary Control, and that is significant in respect of the use of ex ante visas in Directorates-General. If that is felt in a Directorate-General to be a relevant and effective way of enhancing financial control, the ex ante system can be used. Naturally, there are diverse requirements across the Commission depending on the number and nature of the financial transactions in which particular Directorates-General have to engage. Account is taken of that too in the White Paper but where there is a desire and a demonstrated need for the use of such a system, it most certainly can be used. Lastly on transition, I share the reservations of Mrs Theato over so-called ""soft law"" . We have had this discussion before and she knows I make a distinction between various forms of codes which can have a very positive effect and eventually be turned into what I suppose we could call ""hard law"" . But, on this issue, I do not see any room for soft law which is why in the transition period there will be total adherence to the current financial regulation until that law is changed by due democratic process in this House and in the Council. There are absolute assurances of that and provisions made for it in the White Paper. In addition, however, and very importantly, because it is a transition period, there will be training, there will be advice, there will be support, there will be assurances. The new head of the audit unit will be in place by 1 May and with that and an accumulation of other assurances I think that we can be as certain as human beings can be that there will be a totally secure system even during the period of transition. Two other points I must make, because this is an essential question central to reform. The first one is that people feel - for reasons I well understand - that in that transition there is a danger either of irresponsibility or of inertia."	fr
We can see who is prepared to vote for a retrospection which is of doubtful legality, which would be a costly burden to every future car buyer and a devastating blow for the European car industry.  Mr President, once again I would like to briefly outline the economic issues involved in this directive, and reaffirm my support for the amendments tabled by my colleague, Bernd Lange. These amendments actually have the advantage - and I should like to stress this - of reconciling environmental constraints and economic imperatives. The Council' s common position was to say that car manufacturers should bear all, or a significant part, of the costs of recovery and recycling. But, as Mr Lange so rightly said, this solution is totally unfair to European car manufacturers. Coming from a country which does have a car manufacturing industry, I can tell you that it is not possible, retroactively, to impose on them the total financial costs for all vehicles of their makes currently on the road, i.e. effectively making them bear the costs arising from 80% of the total number of cars in Europe. This solution is unacceptable because these car manufacturers have not had the opportunity to build the environmental demands we are making of them today into their manufacturing procedures and their manufacturing costs. The common position puts European car manufacturers in a disadvantageous position in relation to manufacturers which have just come to the European market. Of course, we are not here to defend a particular national interest or a particular industrial lobby. We are here to build a Europe that is competitive on the world market and to safeguard jobs in economic sectors where we are actually competitive. This is why, I urge you to support the amendments tabled by Bernd Lange. These amendments will be supported by the Group of the Party of European Socialists since they effectively reconcile all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental constraints - while granting Member States the freedom to select the means to implement these constraints, since these amendments envisage that the systems in place in the Members States, and some of them work perfectly well, will be able to continue to operate. Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector. Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that. Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force. Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic. The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling. The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road.	de
I am sure that the President-in-Office of the Council is prepared to answer everything, but I must ensure that this sitting consists of questions and answers. Mr Rübig has the floor. Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there. Both parties were once part of the government. So far there have been no infringements of the law. Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights? Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union. Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims. I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity. Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force. What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up? Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document? Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter? - (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no. I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council. Question No 8 by (H-0042/00): Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits. These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects. Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process? The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	de
"So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10. Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe. This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region. The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the ""stabilisation and association process"" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability. So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans. The assumption is that the countries are prepared to accept a certain set of conditions. The expectation is that we send them a politically relevant signal that it is possible for them to join us one day, maintaining respect for their sovereignty of course. We are not deluding ourselves by believing that, once agreement is obtained, the mandate we are giving the Commission today could constitute a first major step towards peace and stability in that long-suffering region, where the people have already shown they have the right to seek membership of our area of freedom and development. They have suffered enough, first under the Soviet yoke and then from the high price they paid for being forced to become part of the communist bloc. The evidence is that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is politically and economically capable of establishing new contractual relations with the European Union, going beyond the cooperation agreement in force since 1 June 1998, which in practice targets respect for the acquis communautaire, especially in key areas of the internal market. It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia still has a long way to go, but, given the political and economic reforms already made in the context of the cooperation agreement, and with transitional periods accepted for certain domains, the country will be able to fulfil the conditions for a stabilisation and association agreement. We share the view that its development is a factor for stability in the region, we approve the terms of the negotiating mandate as proposed, emphasising that what is involved is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, and we agree with the rapporteur when he stresses that this is the first concrete application of an integrated long term strategy for south-east Europe, and that the issue is how the Balkans can be structured in the long term in order to guarantee peace and stability."	it
"All these elements have to apply cumulatively. It is also important to bear in mind that there are a wide range of measures, which can be taken in applying the precautionary principle. For example, a research programme, public information campaigns, recommendations and so on. Applying the precautionary principle does not, therefore, automatically imply a ban. This communication does not pretend to be the final word on this issue; however, it is the first time that the Commission has presented a structured presentation of the principle and its operational use. By setting out in some detail how the Commission applies, and intends to apply, the precautionary principle, we hope to be able to clarify the situation at Community level and to contribute to the ongoing debate at European and international level. Mr President, Commissioner, thank you very much for your statement. I have three short questions, the first being as follows. We have been awaiting a common communication from the Commission on the precautionary principle for a very long time now and it was anything but clear in the past as to whether the Commission speaks with one voice. Does the document you have presented here today also accord with the opinion of your colleagues the Commissioners for Industry, Foreign Trade, Competition and the Internal Market? I am sure that your answer to this will be ""yes"" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be? My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example? Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation? In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached? . Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions. Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission. This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today. It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission. So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document. Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example. And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle. We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas. It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health."	es
The second principle in the Council' s common position is the retroactive element in the draft directive. It conflicts with established economic and legal principles retroactively to impose upon a manufacturer financial liability for its product. To do so also changes the owner' s liability retroactively. Over the years, a consumer may have altered the product in a number of ways. Every country within the EU now has rules governing the scrapping of cars. Some may be better than others, and some worse. In anticipation of this EU directive' s being implemented, EU countries ought however to be individually liable for scrapping vehicles in the best way possible so that the retroactive element in the EU legislation is not applied. This does not conflict with a financing model involving the building up of funds. Mr President, everyone agrees with the obvious environmental and industrial importance of the instrument in question. The common position offers an acceptable compromise but its rather delicate and precarious nature somewhat restricts the opportunities for improvement, and puts the whole directive at risk. I therefore maintain that Parliament cannot force the issue and it would be paradoxical for it to do so in the context of redefining the environmental scope of the instrument. I would remind you that car manufacturers have admitted that they can live with the directive; the costs are not excessive: recycling a car costs less than 1% of the price of a new car. Moreover, the manufacturers will not be financially accountable until 2006, when a good number of the existing vehicles will no longer be on the market. As for the remaining vehicles, we could nevertheless provide for some means of sharing costs, as is proposed in Amendments Nos 44 and 45 by Mr Lange, the only ones that seem compatible with the balancing of the common position and with the trials underway in some countries, and we should therefore support them. Mr President, this is an extremely bad directive. First of all, as my colleague Mr Bowis has pointed out, it is retrospective and that is wrong in principle. Secondly, it dumps huge costs on the European motor industry which would damage competitiveness and damage employment. In this Parliament we constantly talk about the need to promote employment and jobs in Europe and yet we constantly pass measures which will have the effect of reducing employment. I suggest to you that the directive is bad in another respect, which has not been examined well enough in this debate. It is like so much European legislation. It is far too prescriptive. It sets in stone one particular model of recycling. The production line was invented about a hundred years ago, I believe, by Henry Ford and what we are proposing to do here is to create a sort of nineteenth century production line in reverse - to dismantle vehicles, to take the pieces apart and seek to recycle them. One thing we should stop and think about is the fact that there is a very uncertain market for recycled plastic bumpers of cars. The plastics industry for the most part does not want to take these things back and cannot economically do so. There is already a very successful industry out there which is shredding cars, recovering metals and recovering energy by the incineration of the non-metallic parts.	de
With regard to the first, the Commission has sent us a series of proposals, contained in two directives and an action plan, which aim to apply the following decision taken by the Heads of State and Government in Tampere. This states that 'The European Union must ensure fair treatment of third country nationals who reside legally on the territory of its Member States. A more vigorous integration policy should aim at granting them rights and obligations comparable to those of EU citizens' . This is totally contrary to what we have seen and found recently in El Ejido where there are irregularities, labour exploitation and indecent living conditions, which have been condemned in the past. I hope for prompt implementation of the measures to achieve integration. I also hope that the governments which produced such wonderful words in Tampere, including Spain, will work diligently to apply these. I have less hope about the development of an effective and fair European policy in accordance with the statement made by the Council on immigration. The only proposal which has been made is for the directive on family reunification. This is a key issue, as we have seen recently in the media that there are many men on their own in El Ejido. Yet we do not know whether this has been accepted by the governments. Outside the Community arena, some governments are making efforts to renew their immigration policies. This is occurring in my country, despite the government, the party in power being the only one which does not like the new law on aliens. The objective of combating racism and xenophobia, explained in the Treaties, should be the objective of all European institutions and politicians. On 28 February 1998 the European political parties, including the Spanish Popular Party, signed the Charter of European Political Parties for a Non-Racist Society. This requires coherent behaviour, yet local leaders of the Popular Party are throwing more fuel on the raging fire and boycotting the attempts of other institutions to put this out. The party to which the Mayor of El Ejido belongs should, according to the commitments signed in this Charter, act forcefully. It is only, as stated by Mr Hernández Mollar, through unity, responsibility and firmness that El Ejido, Spain and Europe will be able to overcome these events of which we are deeply ashamed. Mr President, one cannot but feel disgust and indignation at the scenes of lynching, no less, of Moroccan day labourers which took place in El Ejido. We do not the extent to which far-right commandos were to blame and how far the common people stupid enough to follow these commandos were to blame. We wish to assure these Moroccan workers that they have our full support - as if being exploited by unscrupulous employers were not enough, they have to suffer this type of aggression. And if the aggressors include working-class people, all we can say to them is that, in acting in this way, they are digging their own graves.	it
And finally, in conclusion, our demand regarding the future responsibilities of the European Parliament in the matters we are discussing, competition policy and state aid, in the context of the Intergovernmental Conference. As you know, Commissioner, our report argues that the codecision procedure should apply in the case of basic legislation on state aid. Mr President, Commissioner, my contribution to today' s debate concerns the steel aid code, that is the state aid in Europe granted in accordance with this code and which was assessed by the Commission. There were a total of 27 cases in 1998 and the Commission submitted its own report on these. The ECSC Treaty is due to expire shortly. Hence, what we must focus on today is the question as to how state aid is to be managed in future. The European Commission' s decisions, which feature in the report, are welcomed by the European Parliament, as is the decision to ask for the money back in specific cases, thus applying Article 88 of the ECSC Treaty. The competitiveness of the European steel industry also forms the subject of the Commission' s most recent communication, which we have not yet debated in Parliament. As in other sectors, the general ban on state aid according to Article 87 (1) of the EC Treaty also applies to the iron and steel industry. According to this article, state aid is irreconcilable with the common market, in principle. Exemptions are only permitted in precisely defined cases. Under Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state aid. In 1998, the largest case concerned the supply of company capital totalling EUR 540 million to the PREUSSAG in Germany. Furthermore, the Member States must give the Commission advance warning with regard to their intentions concerning state aid. The rules pertaining to the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996. These stipulate that state aid can only be awarded to the steel industry in particular, precisely-defined cases i.e. those involving aid for research and development, aid for environmental protection, social security to ease the closure of steelworks and aid to help non-competitive enterprises cease trading altogether. In addition, there is a special provision of up to EUR 50 million for Greece. However, there were obviously problems with the practical administration of the steel aid code over the past few years that were not brought fully to bear in the report. As far as Parliament is concerned, it is important for us to waste no time in getting down to a debate on the regulations that are to succeed this state aid code once it has expired. There must be no watering-down of the existing principles underlying the steel aid code. No one wants an unimpeded subsidy competition in Europe. This would be to the considerable disadvantage of the internal market, regardless of the fact that the steel industry has undergone consolidation in the past few years. Consequently, Parliament believes it is necessary for the steel aid code to be amended in the light of the industry' s claims about unequal treatment, and for the Commission to provide the Council with follow-up regulations.	es
"Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking. This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on. I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values. In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, I am not sure which to go by: the strategic objectives for 2000 to 2005 or your speech for 2000 to 2010? Have you already included your second term of office? But seriously. As it enlarges, the Union needs to be strengthened through streamlining and demarcation. First, streamlining. What you say in your programme about concentrating on the core functions of the Commission is only the beginning. The activities of the entire Union must be reduced to core areas of policy. In other words, a social, ecologically-orientated market, a secure currency, guaranteed civil rights internally and representation of common interests externally. It is not just that we need to speak out in the world with one voice; it is what we want to say with this voice that it is important. Secondly, the new ""in"" word is flexibility. However, increasing flexibility can or quickly threatens to turn into intergovernmentalisation. We must hold fast to joint decision-making institutions which embrace the Member States. That also applies to the inclusion of the civil society, which is a welcome step. Our citizens do not need any new institutions and certainly no new mixing of powers. (Applause) Transparency does not mean more access to more paper; to our citizens, transparency means greater clarity at long last as to who takes decisions in Brussels and Strasbourg, when and with what right. That is transparency. Thirdly, the European Union cannot and should not enlarge endlessly. Its borders are set not by how may countries want to join, but by how many countries it can accommodate. (Applause) If the price of enlargement is the watering-down or even the break-up of the present Union, then it must not be paid. It is too high a price, not only for the Member States already in the Union but also for the states which want to join the Union. There is no future for a Union which is merely a geo-strategic concept or for a Union which is merely a free trade zone. But the Union will only continue to be more than a market and to be accredited by the people of Europe if it sees itself as a community of destinies. That goes far beyond your new economic and social agenda or a new, better quality of life. Not only the Commission, not only the European Parliament but also the people and the states in our European Union will have to find new answers to the question of how and why we want to live and work together. In doing so, we need, no less, to reinvent the European Union, but without destroying the present Union. (Applause) Madam President, in the opinion of the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party, the most important task of the Commission and the whole Union in the coming years is the successful realisation of enlargement."	de
In parallel, it can benefit from substantial financial support via the PHARE programme. However, the EU' s present policy in the Balkans is fragmentary, inconsistent and schizophrenic in nature. There are different types of agreements or relations or lack of relations - going even as far as the embargo on Yugoslavia - which result in a fragmented and ineffectual approach. There is no sense of regionality for the Balkans, which would include everyone without exceptions or vindictiveness. Finally, intervention by the European Union to solve the problem of FYROM' s name - which is unfortunately becoming a long drawn out problem and could make an already tense situation even more fraught - and to respond more energetically towards negotiating FYROM' s principles within a reasonable time scale, is necessary and useful. . (FR) The Commission' s stated desire to strengthen relations between the European Union and the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and to grant this country the prospect of full integration into the Community would appear to respond to a primary concern: a political entity which respects nations and their sovereignty could no longer postpone sending a signal to these states in south-east Europe which history has shown no consideration for since the end of the Second World War. Having been crushed beneath the heel of triumphant Communism, this region has not stopped paying the price for the collapse of the Soviet system since the beginning of the 1990s. And yet, under these difficult conditions, especially since the military intervention in the Balkans by NATO, some of these genuinely European countries have demonstrated a sense of responsibility which entitles them to aspire to join the Community. In this sense, the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia is both an exemplary and a symbolic case. Exemplary because it proves that the Balkan countries are not at the mercy of fate and that those of them which so wish are already in a position to meet the standard requirements imposed by the European Union in stability and association agreements. Symbolic because it reflects well on the Fifteen' s project to see the birth of a policy which is common to the five countries in the region (Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, FYROM and Albania) and which would make economic and political stability a pressing and urgent requirement. The UEN Group is all the more in favour of sending this signal to the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia because it leaves plenty of room for the independence and sovereignty of the states. A satisfactory solution cannot be found in the Balkans without a strong policy of cooperation between the states concerned; but nor can there be any question of blocking their process of integration because one of them is considered unworthy of such promotion. The Union is simply doing its job when it seeks through its cooperation policy to encourage nations to espouse a platform of common values with it, of which democracy and civil liberty are the cornerstone. It is not its job to subrogate to people in their choices or, failing that, reinvent a new variation on a 'sense of history' which perceives self-determination as a one-way street.	fr
It is not a situation that most people in this Parliament want, but we need to be careful about the approach we take, so that we do not in the end up with the opposite of what we are trying to achieve. Madam President, I strongly refute any statement, demonstration or feeling of xenophobia or racism. I passionately defend Europe' s heritage of human rights and the rule of law. I disagree, however, for this very reason, with the senseless actions taken by the Presidency - the Portuguese Presidency unfortunately - which have resulted in a real institutional blunder on behalf of the other fourteen States. This is not the way to fight extremism. It may even be a way of doing extremism a great deal of good. The torrent of confusion and rash actions that has been unleashed over Austria has blown things out of all proportion. It has caused considerable distress to decent citizens and evokes risks that had previously not even been considered. There is an irreconcilable contradiction between positions adopted in the name of human rights and the rule of law, but which at the same time attack the fundamental rights of the Austrians and ride roughshod over the basic tenets of the rule of law, in this case the standards laid down in the Treaties. What are we actually seeking to achieve in embarking on an Intergovernmental Conference? A Europe of 27 States or a Europe of 14, or even fewer? We support Europe, a Europe which does honour to all the actions that have brought us to this point, a Europe which respects the Treaties and the law and a Europe which needs Austria. This needs to be said! Madam President, I am delighted and proud that this Parliament has, by an enormous majority, condemned the formation of the coalition in Austria incorporating Mr Haider' s Freedom Party. Mr Haider has demonstrated, over the past years by both words and deeds, that he deserves to be excluded from normal democratic discourse. Not only has he admired Adolf Hitler, praised the Waffen SS, and refused to condemn a terrorist bombing that killed four Roma, but also in Carinthia has been a member of the regional government. He has led efforts to end provision for Austria' s Slovene-speaking minority and assistance to immigrants. Some have said it is not right for us to interfere in Austrian politics. They are wrong. European Union Treaties make it incumbent on us to protect fundamental rights. Some have said we have to accept the results of democratic elections. However, democratic elections do not make democrats of those who have threatened democracy. There is the tragic monument of the Holocaust, the death of 6 million Jews, to those who argued the same case with respect to Germany in the 1930s. However, we should not condemn Mr Haider for ambition. Leopards do not change their spots. The real culprits are Austria' s Christian Democrat acting as Judas goats to resurrect a threat to Europe that we thought had died Berlin in 1945.	de
Mr President, I would like to start my additional question with the Tibetan greeting, which betokens peace and happiness. We are not just talking about human rights and the environment where Tibet is concerned, rather it is about a unique cultural heritage that is also able to communicate important values such as peace, serenity, compassion - as the Dalai Lama would say - to us Europeans. The question before us now is what can the Commission do to provide more practical support for his Holiness, the Dalai Lama' s, proposal for a peaceful solution to the Tibet affair? I would point out that doing nothing will be the death of Tibetan culture and will mean the end of the Tibetan people. I have much sympathy with what the honourable Member has said about cultural heritage and about the Buddhist tradition. Like the honourable Member I have read the autobiography of the Dalai Lama. It is an extremely moving account, not just of his responsibilities in and towards Tibet but also of his spiritual views as well. The Commission, like others, has urged dialogue. The Dalai Lama has made it clear that peaceful dialogue is what he wishes. I wish that the Chinese authorities had responded consistently and positively to that overture from the Dalai Lama. At or around the time of President Clinton's visit to China, the President of the People's Republic of China gave the impression that dialogue was on the agenda. It would be very beneficial, not just for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but it would also be greatly to the credit of the Government of the People's Republic of China if they were to respond to those attempts to begin a dialogue. Question No 31 by (H-0795/99): Subject: Commission's rejection of legislation on proper administration in the EU According to newspaper reports, the Commission has rejected the proposal by EU Ombudsman Jacob Söderman for a citizens? right to proper administration in the EU. Although the Commission has itself approved the idea of legislation on proper administration, it has not now accepted a detailed proposal that has been made, but has decided to issue a whole set of additional guidelines on improving service. Are these reports accurate? What is the reason for the Commission?s acting in this way, and how can it explain the resultant discrepancy between its words and its actions on the reform of EU administration? Does the Commission consider that what has happened is compatible with the five-point programme agreed between Parliament and the Commission in September, and is it prepared to submit a detailed proposal for legislation on proper administration in a form which allows Parliament to express an opinion on it? Mr Patten has the floor on behalf of the Commission. The newspaper reports that the honourable Member made reference to seem to me to be misleading and inaccurate. In November 1999 the Commission approved at first reading a code of good administrative behaviour to be incorporated into its Rules of Procedure. At the moment the Commission is consulting its staff representatives on the document, a process which will be finalised in the forthcoming weeks. The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.	it
Mr Pietrasanta explained why we support some aspects of the Commission' s proposal, in particular support for development of a vaccine and compensation for farmers who are forced to slaughter their fish, but were not at all happy with the idea of changes to the slaughter policy. Now people have said here that Norway has done a better job of controlling the epidemic of ISA and that the proposed change will bring us more in line with the Norwegian approach, but it must be said that there is more than just one difference between the Norwegian policy and that of the Community. This is a Community policy which will effect Ireland as well - where I am from - should similar unfortunate events occur. There are other differences that exist in the policy for inspections of disease, fallowing periods, restriction on movement of contaminated fish and materials and others. Before we jump to copy the slaughter policy of the Norwegians, we should try these other things first to see if we can mitigate the disaster. And people have spoken in the past about BSE. For many years the Greens were calling for the BSE issue to be addressed. Had it been at that time, you could have actually saved an awful lot of farmers and the EU a huge amount of money. So it also has to do with environmental protection. The protection of the farmers themselves and the protection of public health. I would like to thank Mr Hudghton for his excellent report on ISA and for broadly supporting the measures proposed by the Commission and also for the contributions from each of the speakers this evening. The Commission proposal aims to ensure a more pragmatic approach towards controlling a disease that has the potential to cause important losses in salmon farms. However, this cannot be allowed to compromise our objective of reducing and possibility eliminating ISA. Nor can it be done, if the proposal involves a threat to public health. The environmental implications must also be taken very seriously. I am advised that ISA is considered non-pathogenic for humans and mammals. The disease exists since 1984 and there is no report of it affecting human health or mammals. The virus harms cold-blooded animals. It does not replicate at temperatures above 25º centigrade and would, if present in fish for human consumption, be inactivated when ingested. In no way, however, can diseased fish be used for human consumption. As an extra precaution, I am validating this advice to our scientific committee. During the debate, a number of important issues linked to our disease-control strategy have been raised including compensation. I deeply regret the losses suffered by the Scottish salmon industry. You may know that with effect from 15 January 2000, under the new financial instrument for fisheries guidance, Member States may encourage eradication of diseases in aquaculture. The Commission' s services are drawing up implementing rules in order to ensure the practical application of this instrument. Council Decision 90/424 constitutes another instrument for Community financial support in case of disease outbreaks.	it
Whatever we may say about the European elections, the low turnout is a fact. We can improve on this by punishing crime in Europe quickly, and this must be done at European level. Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur. Mrs Theato' s report may help to restore confidence in European institutions. I believe that is something we are all desperately in need of, bearing in mind the results of the last European elections and of the level of turnout. Yet, every year we have the same problem. The Court of Auditors publishes its report, which criticises the Member States on account of various incidences of fraud. So far, however, the European institutions have not had sufficient means at their disposal to take vigorous action here, to ensure that implementation actually takes place and that matters are remedied. It is precisely this process that undermines confidence every year. I believe that Mrs Theato' s report and her proposal can help to reverse this very process and to make clear that the European institutions take steps to ensure that European money is employed in a targeted manner and that no fraud is perpetrated here. It is important that after the first step, which has already been taken, i.e. forming OLAF from UCLAF - an independent institution - we now take the second step and create a legal framework for OLAF, in order that OLAF too might operate within a secure legal framework. We will need the European Public Prosecutor' s Office for this, which will see to it that there are clear legal guarantees, also for suspects. Having said all that, I must say that unfortunately, my group will not be voting for your report as a united front. I hope that the debate will convince a few more people. Unfortunately, however, people still have too many misgivings to the effect that this will be the kind of European institution that undermines subsidiarity. But I will do what I can to see that Mrs Theato' s report receives more support. Mr President, we are basically in favour of the resolution that has been tabled, even if we think that this can only be interpreted as an invitation by Parliament to the Council to amend the Treaties, so that effective protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests can be guaranteed. The establishment of a European Public Prosecutor' s Office and the definition of offences common to all countries of the Union is doubtless a good idea, but it is impossible to consider putting this into practice without having first introduced a European legal system. Indeed, we are talking about criminal law, the area where resistance that national States put up to communitisation is, and will be, fierce. Indeed, it is unthinkable that we could put in place substantial and procedural legal regulations solely for one sector - that of the protection of financial interests - without first having created a European legal system. Reading the precise and comprehensive explanations in the Theato report makes you realise just how many problems still need to be resolved and what these problems are. In any case, this idea must be encouraged, and it will doubtless be during this attempt to protect financial interests that we realise that we need to include a Community corpus iuris in the Treaties. On behalf of my group, but also personally, I hope that the vital financial spirit of the Union will pave the way for the creation of a European legal system which respects citizens' rights and guarantees, which is to say a legal system that will raise guarantees to the acceptable levels hitherto unseen in many States.	it
Mrs Rothe, I would put it this way: I am convinced that there has been a distinct improvement in the framework conditions for reaching agreements of this kind. I do not have confirmation of this at present, and nor do I expect it, since we have not yet held direct talks. These will take place at a later date. The framework conditions have changed in that the Helsinki decisions made a whole range of things possible that were not possible hitherto, and, above all, in that the political strategies employed by the parties concerned have changed beyond recognition. I have always believed that the old line - i.e. not to admit Cyprus under any circumstances until the political conflict has been resolved - has a weak point in that it does not provide the Turkish community on Cyprus with a convincing incentive to properly involve themselves, for, with this strategy, the Turkish community would not need to do anything but sit back and wait. There would then be no question of Cyprus acceding to the Union. As matters stand, Turkey has to take seriously the fact that there is a risk of Cyprus being integrated into the European Union, and this would provide opportunities for prosperity and security for the Greek community whilst the Turkish community, whose level of prosperity is already far lower, would fall even further behind. Therefore, it is my firm belief that, since Helsinki, there has been far greater incentive to link the accession process with the resolution of the conflict. Indeed that was the idea behind it. After only a few weeks, Mrs Rothe, it is still too early to deliver a verdict on this, but in any case, I have no grounds for assuming that the new line will fail. As yet, we have no grounds for saying that we will actually succeed, but one thing I can say quite clearly is that the conditions that need to be in place for us to take a step forwards have improved considerably. Finally, of course, the Cyprus question has a role in the discussions with Turkey. I met the Turkish Foreign Minister in Brussels a few weeks ago and naturally I asked if Turkey could take a positive and constructive stance in relation to this issue. I would just make one point: we cannot be 100% sure - I am not at any rate - that one only has to press a button in Ankara to set the wheels in motion in Cyprus. It is very far from being that simple, rather we are going to have to make concentrated efforts, during talks with both communities, to encourage them to reach an understanding. That is what we intend to do: the necessary measures and programmes are in place. I must make it clear to you that we need this financial regulation, the one that has yet to be decided on here, before we can even get started. The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus. I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so. If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that.	fr
I want to know whether this also applies in the document which the Commission has presented now. . (SV) Thank you, Mrs Schörling. These are two important questions, and it is good that I should be given the opportunity to clarify them. No, one must not begin by carrying out a cost-benefit analysis. Instead, the latter should be based upon an assessment of what it is we know, of what science has to tell us and of how we should view the product concerned in the light of the risks we judge there to exist for the environment or for the health of human beings or animals. When, on the other hand, the decision has been made to take a certain measure, the one chosen ought to be cost-effective so that there is in fact no resort to measures which are wholly unreasonable given their degree of effectiveness. It is not, therefore, the case that one must begin with a cost-benefit analysis. The second question concerns the reversed burden of proof. It is perfectly correct that we need to apply this in certain cases. I have used chemical strategy as a good example of an area in which we need to do this. There, however, we are concerned with that particular area, whereas it may be said that the present communication concerning the precautionary principle is horizontal in the sense that it concerns the full range of specific technical areas that are of political concern. Therefore, the issues of the reversed burden of proof and of what the burden of proof is to look like are not especially discussed in this context. Instead, it is a question of political decision-making and of the bases for this. It is, however, perfectly correct that, when it comes, for example, to chemicals, we must ensure that we obtain a reversed burden of proof. Mr President, I believe that the precautionary principle needs to be quite radical in order to work, otherwise we shall always be confused by all the different interpretations possible. I will give an example: a fungicide has been proven to cause babies to be born blind. It is therefore a teratogenic substance. Very well, it is a fungicide, it kills off mould. This teratogenicity has been demonstrated by just one English laboratory, perhaps because it is the only one that has carried out tests. Now, in my opinion, given that this is such a serious risk to health, the precautionary principle lays down that this product should immediately be taken off the market, which New Zealand has done, for example. So I want to put this question to you. When human health is at stake, or there is the possibility that human health will be seriously affected, should we not perhaps carry out a cost-benefit analysis? The cost of a baby being born blind is too high; there are no benefits that can compensate for this. In short, Commissioner, I would therefore like to know whether in this case, the precautionary principle as you understand it, would in any case, require the product to be taken off the market, until such time as another laboratory provides evidence to the contrary. . (SV) Mr President, no one wants more than I do to see a situation in which we are able to apply the precautionary principle in such a way that it is seen as radically protecting people' s health and the environment.	fr
"The White Paper and the report are contributions made at the beginning of a necessary process of reflection, discussion, and reform which has yet to be concluded because there are still a few questions posed by ourselves, the judiciary, the Member States, and above all the SMEs concerned, that need to be clarified. Competition policy must continue to be accorded central importance and will not be renationalised because this would jeopardise the internal market and Europe as a business location in a global economy. However, it must be ""europeanised"" taking into account the principle of subsidiarity. I also welcome, therefore, the fact that responsibility is to fall to the individual, without the Commission giving up any of its responsibility. In practice, only 9 cases were rejected, 94% of the cases that the Commission had to process were not dealt with formally but by means of unpublished, non-legally binding administrative communications or on account of the expiry of deadlines, which clearly shows that the work of the Commission is subject to time-related, staffing and financial limitations in this age of globalisation and EU enlargement To conclude, I would like to tell you what I am expecting from this reform: fair competition and equal competition conditions, legal certainty for all enterprises, consistent application of competition policy, procedural simplification according to the principle of the one-stop-shop, coordination of the national - and to me, independent - competition authorities, close cooperation between the national authorities and courts and the Commission, along with a clear distribution of competences between national authorities and courts in the application of European competition and monopolies law, and I expect the Commission to concentrate on what is most crucial in the fulfilment of its tasks as the supreme guardian of the European competition policies. I am in suspense as to how the discussions, which were broadly based, will be incorporated in the first legislative proposal. The Commission report confirms that, with the exception of Germany, state aid to businesses is increasing. The Commission finds this worrying only from the point of view of the conditions of competition. As far as we are concerned, we look at things from the point of view of the interests of the working classes. Society gains nothing from these massive transfers of public funds to private business. Take, for example, the car manufacturing sector, where subsidies and state aid of various sorts have increased by 24% during the reference period. With what aim? Not to save jobs. All these firms have gone ahead with job cuts and even redundancies. Not to improve working conditions, for in increasing production with fewer workers, working conditions are made worse. Did these firms need state aid to survive? No, car manufacturers have been making colossal profits for years. State aid is not only counterproductive because, as the Jonckheer report acknowledges, it gives rise to subsidy hunting with firms relocating from one country to another, but it is unacceptable because it allocates public monies to the enrichment of a handful of private shareholders. It is because the richest people are being favoured everywhere with state money that throughout Europe social protection is being reduced, public services are being abandoned, hospitals are being closed."	it
It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves. Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned. To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence. This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States. The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms. Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities. Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage. On average, to manage $US 10 million of aid there are 2.9 staff at the Commission, compared with 4.3 at the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in major Member States. This is a real problem: there are too many different financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and in particular a series of different budget headings. This is difficult to reconcile with the needs of an effective management system. In order to face and solve these problems the Community needs to engage in an effective dialogue with Member States and Parliament. It is absolutely crucial that we tackle the coherence issue in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means holding the debate in the appropriate institutional framework, that is, the Council and Parliament. The lack of concerted action among the 15 Member States themselves and between them and the Community also needs to be addressed. By focusing the Community's development policy on internationally agreed targets and strategies we will pave the way for better complementarity with the Member States. This is very much the line also just presented by Minister Amado. When we talk policies nowadays, we engage in a process of convergence. This is part of the solution. We are in the process of formulating new policy guidelines and we need to identify priority areas for Community action. Everything has become more and more complex. This is also true of development cooperation. No single donor is in a position to address the whole spectrum of themes, ranging from macro-economic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new cross-cutting themes such as gender, environment, good governance and institutional reforms. It is important to find flexible mechanisms that accommodate a division of labour according to the expertise and capacity of the various donors in each developing country. This should be done at Member State level and should lead to the formulation of sector policies for Community action. This is where we want to go. To identify the EC's priority areas of support, account has to be taken of the Community's specific features in relation to the Member States and to international institutions.	es
We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management. Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company. The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect. Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow. However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit. There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital. Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare? We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results. Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' . Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring. Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres. I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs. Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution. But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision. This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone. We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent. In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave. In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted. Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant.	es
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies. I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows. My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement. Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions. Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public. In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference. At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism. Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end. All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference. This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States. In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing. The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us. Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki. It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions. In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary.	fr
This, ladies and gentlemen, could be the decade of Europe. Indeed, I would say that this must be the decade of Europe. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, the Group of the European People' s Party (Christian Democrats) and European Democrats welcomes this debate and we welcome the fact that the Commission submitted a document so that we could prepare for the debate. We also welcome the conclusions which we find in this document. And we welcome the broad outlines of the speech which President Prodi has just given. We read in the conclusions in the document that the five-year term of office of the Prodi Commission will be a time of major changes. Europe will press ahead with integration; at the same time the Union will start an enlargement process which will, in the end, reunite our continent. A demanding, ambitious, perhaps even prophetic task and we wish you every success, Mr President of the Commission. However, we consider that the present is the basis of the future and we shall only be able to shape the future if we prove our worth in the present. I say that in all earnestness and I have chosen my words carefully. I refer to the current debate on the present conflicts in the European Union. We in the European Union are one Community. We belong together, even when there are problems. Now is not the time to isolate but to unite and to complete together the task of unifying Europe. Mr President of the Commission, you have represented and defended the European Parliament time and again over recent weeks. You have seen yourself as the guardian of the Treaties, and that is indeed your role. For that and for the letter to the Federal Chancellor of the Republic of Austria which you mentioned, we expressly respect, acknowledge and support you. (Applause) Mr President of the Commission, our objectives are one and the same: we want a strong Europe in the twenty-first century, a democratic Europe which is able to act. A Europe which defends its values of human dignity and democratic rule of law both internally and to the outside world and, at the same time, looks after its global interests with dignity, patience and convincing self-confidence. Europe' s message, the European Union' s message to the world should not be one of arrogance or even European nationalism, no; it must be one of cooperation, partnership and peaceful development. Globalisation gives us the chance to shape the world, which is becoming smaller and smaller, as a world of peaceful competition and solidarity. Seen in this light, globalisation is more of an opportunity than a danger, more of a coming together than a segregation, more mutual enrichment than separation. But we also know that we can only shape the huge challenge of globalisation together as Europeans. Globalisation is not only an economic process, it is also a cultural process, which is why we say: we want partnership in the world, we do not want the clash of civilisations which many are predicting, we want partnership, a meeting, exchange and peace.	fr
Here too, the structure of the economy differs for each Member State, and the ways in which the current status has been achieved are diverse. It will not do for one type of policy, probably with many exceptions and adaptations, to be applied. This would mean that the EU would unjustly be removing tasks from Member States and that the Brussels bureaucracy would be intervening unnecessarily. It is preferable for Member States to take measures to stimulate employment themselves. Their expertise, is, of course, superior to that of the Commission. This is why I am very hesitant when it comes to formulating Community measures to promote employment. Even in the tourism industry. It would really be a nuisance if Parliament were to attempt to achieve this unofficially by extending its powers. Mr President, you will understand that we cannot assent to the present resolution as it stands. First of all I should like to thank Mr Viceconte for all the work that he has done on this report. It is a very extensive report. We greatly welcome it, just as we welcomed the original report that it was based on, the report of the high-level working group which was set up by the European Commission. I hope that the Commission will not forget that. Having set it up, I hope the Commission actually makes use of it and therefore does not just allow it to sit around in the corridors and gather dust. Tourism is basically small businesses and therefore a very fertile area for job creation. As has already been said in this debate, three million potential new jobs within the next ten years is something well worth going for. Europe can no longer refuse to give the recognition - both political and in terms of policy-making - that the fastest growing sector of its economy deserves because of its economic and social position. We need a more dynamic vision based on tourism' s contribution to job creation. We must recognise a sector that is predominantly engaged in cross-border activity and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach to sustainable business development. I know the Commissioner is very keen on information technology. He has convinced me of that. But his portfolio of information technology and tourism actually go very well together. There are several reasons why the tourism industry is an ideal test-bed, therefore, for integrating job creation strategies. Let us look at some of these reasons. The importance to the economy of tourism and its growth potential is obviously one. Various sectors of the population are employed by the tourism industry, particularly the more vulnerable groups, such as young people, women and the unskilled. I am not saying that we do not need to raise the skills within the sector - of course we do - but let us get the jobs established first. The availability of unskilled, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some of the economic areas of the Community.	es
I will mention just a few: our ability to combine development policy with trade policy and to ensure synergies between aid and economic cooperation; our neutrality and defence of overall Community interests; the fact that we represent a critical mass and are able to do relatively large jobs compared to what individual Member States can normally do. Also, our presence on the ground: basically, I find the biggest value we represent is the very fact that being a successful regional cooperation endeavour ourselves, we are seen as a neutral, welcome partner for this experiment world-wide - something which nobody else can claim to be. It is vital to make Community policy more effective and to develop a more operational strategic framework. It is this dual challenge that the Commission has to take up, by framing in the months ahead a proposal for a general policy statement. We will launch a broad and open consultation process in order to get the views of all the different parties interested. I see the process not quite but almost as important as the content and we will put all our resources into participating actively and we invite everybody to participate. Parallel to this we have also embarked on the process of improving coherence and clarifying and bringing to the surface and into the open the real or imaginary problems we are having in this respect. This will be an ongoing process which I see as a kind of continued quality control effort and I invite Parliament to participate in this ongoing effort to improve the coherence of what we are doing. Mr President, I would firstly like to thank Mr Amado and Mr Nielson. I am pleased that Mr Amado talked about the EDF. The problem, however, should not be sought within this Parliament or the Commission; it is the Council that needs to make a decision on the EDF budget. This sermon, therefore, really belongs in the Council. Mr President, I thank Mr Nielson. He has talked extensively about the new Lomé Convention, although this is not really the topic of this morning' s meeting. We want to talk about coherence. This is the topic. Ever since the early nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council of Ministers have recognised that this coherence of European policy is leaves something to be desired, especially in the field of development cooperation and in other EU policies. This problem has been highlighted on several occasions, to whit in 1992, in 1995 and 1997. The examples are all quoted in a resolution which lies before us. I have raised questions regarding this issue for years now. In fact, the obligation for coherence of policy was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam in 1997. In 1998, it was agreed that the European Commission should publish an annual report which highlights any improvements. But what have we seen since then? Fine words, as is the case again today, but no report. It is too crazy for words, really.	es
"Quite frankly a hierarchy of oppression has been created. And so long as people do not have equality before the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be eroded. In our enlargement process in the EU we have rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities. We must not waiver in that commitment. But we must also hold up the mirror to ourselves and recognise our own inadequacies. Yes, conventions have been signed, but action is needed. I would recommend to you ongoing audits of human rights practices, eternal vigilance, not just outside our borders but within. That is why I would welcome an annual Member State report from each individual state which would have to record any charges against it and the action taken. Because what happens in each Member State happens to every single one of us. What happens in another part of the world affects us. Pinochet in Chile is as relevant as Haider in Austria. Human rights and civil liberties are inextricably linked. Human rights do not exist in isolation, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our home affairs policies, indeed they are at the very heart of our democratic functions. I would repeat what Mr Patten said: we must engage, we must inform, educate and thereby effect real and lasting change. Mr President, ""Europe stands for ideals, values and principles. We must emphasise Europe' s spiritual history. Together, we must re-establish the values which unite Europe. Spiritual values have been disseminated from Europe throughout the globe. We must live with our consciences."" These were the words spoken three hours ago in this Chamber by the President of the Czech Republic, Vaclav Havel. In an extraordinarily edifying speech, characterised by wisdom, historical knowledge, an understanding of the human heart and insight into Europe' s spiritual and Christian heritage, he pointed to sources of inspiration for our work on human justice and human dignity. We should be grateful that there are Heads of State like Vaclav Havel in our Europe. I wish to discuss two matters. First of all, civil society. Vaclav Havel stated that, in Eastern Europe, the Communist regimes methodically destroyed civil society: national movements, churches and the independent trade unions. The same is happening in China in connection with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches. It is happening with Buddhism in Tibet. We must never forget to defend civil society. I also want to mention the death penalty. Like my own country, Sweden, the EU bases its view of human beings upon the equal, unique and inviolable value of every human. On the basis of this principle, human beings should always have the chance to redeem themselves. Try telling that to the governments of the United States, Russia and China. Mr President, President-in-Office, Commissioner, I believe the approach of EU Member States at Geneva should be to prioritise the situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China."	fr
"This is why I think that this first agreement with Macedonia is so crucial, because it serves as a model. I am convinced that the four other countries are wondering what is going to happen. What does the European Union intend to do with Macedonia? Will it do the same to us? This first step is so important because of this model function. Macedonia also serves as a model for another reason. The rapporteur has already hinted at this in no uncertain terms, namely, the issue of interethnic relations. There is no need to paint too much of an idealistic picture. During the presidential elections, it appeared that things were not running too smoothly, but compared to the rest of the region, Macedonia could serve as a model. We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians. This model function also applies to regional cooperation. I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other. Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal. If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more. Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle. I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support. I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia. Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime. But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is. Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive. So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10. Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe. This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region. The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the ""stabilisation and association process"" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability."	es
Regional disparities are becoming much more marked within the Member States. If we examine the data presented in the sixth periodic report, we will see that the last decade has witnessed a proliferation of regional disparities. Little consideration, if any at all, has been given to the great problems facing the island regions of the Union whose shortcomings as regards infrastrucutres structure, transport, communication and energy has resulted in their gradual depopulation. The Union' s economic and social policy is just as much to blame for that as its regional policy. A large section of the Union' s population has strongly condemned this policy for being dangerous and anti grass-roots. Unfortunately, the new guidelines seem to be heading in the same direction and there are no signs that things will change once they have been implemented. Mr President, I would like to say a few words in order to highlight two points made in these reports which are of fundamental strategic importance to the way we see the Union. The first is the fundamental, central importance that we continue to give to the principle of economic and social cohesion. We are concerned to hear news that the Commission is taking this objective less seriously. We still feel that economic and social cohesion is one of the Union' s fundamental objectives. Secondly, I agree with what has already been said on the issue of the islands and I would also like to bring the outermost regions to your attention. In future, we would like to see greater ambition applied to the subject of the outermost regions such as, in my country, the islands of the Azores and Madeira. I would like to ask if the Commission is able to enlighten us on the reasons for the delay in the Commission' s report on the outermost regions, which has been long awaited by Parliament? Mr President, first of all I would like to thank the rapporteur, not least for being willing to include in the report the suggestions we made. Mr President, Commissioner, the guidelines are intended to help steer the Member States towards achieving the reform objectives contained in the programmes. However, contrary to their claim to provide guidance, the Commission' s proposals in this respect are reminiscent to a far greater extent of a catalogue of possible measures within the scope of the various policy areas. Nonetheless, their true purpose is to give direction and to set priorities. I agree with the rapporteur that unfortunately the Commission document contains too little in the way of recommendations to the Member States on simplifying administration, and I support the calls for negotiations to concentrate on promoting a favourable climate for labour-intensive, small and medium-sized enterprises, on setting clear objectives for alternative sources of financing including provisions for risk capital and private financing, and on start-up help for companies including new information technologies and investment in innovative fields. I am particularly in favour of a proposed amendment tabled by my Group to paragraph 10, to ensure an appropriate level of private sector involvement in the planning and implementation of the projects.	it
Fourthly, as Parliament ascribes so much value to LIFE, it has allocated ever-greater appropriations to this project in its annual budget. This means that approving the proposal put forward by the Council and by the Commission would represent an unacceptable reversal of this trend. Our concern does not centre purely on the budgetary issue, however. Climate change and water policy are subjects that are of great concern to the European public and which have deserved considerable attention from this House. We therefore feel it is crucial that as Amendments Nos 5 and 6 seek to establish as objectives which LIFE-Environment should achieve a plan for the sustainable management of ground water and surface water, as well as for reducing greenhouse gases, they should be adopted. Lastly, I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on her report and to take the opportunity to say to her that we will be voting in favour of her amendments on comitology even though, as was made clear in the Committee on the Environment, we would prefer LIFE to have been monitored by an advisory committee, we do want to contribute to allowing the solution proposed by the Council to be accepted as quite frankly, it was worse. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, LIFE is the European Union' s most important instrument and indeed its only financial instrument dedicated exclusively to the environment. That explains why this instrument must live up to our ambitions, ambitions for which, of course, there is a price. Obviously, the basic item for discussion with the Council will be the allocation for LIFE III. The common position stipulates a total appropriation of EUR 613 million for the period 2000-2004. This is not enough. The Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party is in favour of increasing this amount to EUR 850 million. We therefore support Mrs Lienemann' s amendment which observes that the allocation for LIFE was not increased when the Union was last enlarged, without even mentioning the next batch of new arrivals. The amount that we are asking for is no great mountain of useless expenditure. Quite the opposite, it is still fairly modest in relation to the requirements to be funded. A drop in the ocean, I might say, in comparison with Europe' s structural policies. The environment is still the poor relation in the European budget, even though it is primarily an investment. An investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been demonstrated that an active environmental policy generated new jobs, as shown particularly by the great success of LIFE, a success with NGOs, businesses, local authorities and third countries. More than one third of the 8,500 requests received meet the required conditions and it has been possible to cofinance approximately 1,300 projects between 1992 and 1998. A success which Parliament wishes and intends to see perpetuated, and this is why we also support amendment 14 outlining the fourth phase of the LIFE project. In matters of the environment, investment and ambition come in a variety of forms, and indeed must come in a variety of forms in the long term. This is the price of the future of generations to come. Mr President, Commissioner, I am probably going to repeat things my fellow Members have said but I believe that, as far as the Council is concerned, the thing is to repeat over and over what we think of LIFE.	it
I think that we agree that ships have to dispose of waste and residues in port. It follows - and in fact there is no other logical conclusion - that the cardinal rule for clean seas is that it must no longer be worthwhile for waste to be disposed of illegally on the high seas. This is what this is about, and a majority of us have said as much in debates here. In January we had a very thorough debate with you, Commissioner, on the consequences of the Erika disaster. On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas. And this directive on port reception facilities for cargo residues is, of course, also about the question of how to make our seas cleaner. Just for information, we know that 70 000 m3 of detritus is illegally discharged into the North Sea alone every year and, conversely, we know that at present a maximum of 5% to 10% of ships obey the rules and dispose of their waste in port. This scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the Council either. The Council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them. The conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made. In its first reading, Parliament said by a large majority that the ships must make a significant contribution, of at least 90%. And therein lies the difference with the Council, which is saying that a contribution has to be made. But a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case God knows this would be too little. Nothing would change. There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules. What is needed is a standard waste disposal fee for all ships irrespective of how much they actually use the disposal facilities, meaning that the financial incentive to dispose of waste at sea has to be removed, which - as has already been explained here today - was possible in the Baltic Sea through the HELCOM Agreement and the 'no-special-fee' system. If it can be done there it must also be possible for it to work for the remaining European seas, because this is not only about the environment: it is about clean waters, it even has consequences for tourism and - the decisive point - alongside the environmental issue it is also about fair competition. The same conditions must apply to all ships in port and only if Parliament, the Council and the Commission create these conditions together will this fair competition be restored for ports and ships. I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and, in particular, Parliament. I think that people are tired of seeing the hypocrisy of Europe and of ministers each time that there is a catastrophe, as we saw of course with 'Erika' . Oil comes onto the beaches and then politicians and ministers appear and try to clear it up themselves with a tiny little bucket, but when a fortnight later a robust directive is up for debate they have forgotten yesterday's fine words.	it
The nature of the EU has not changed. Since the beginning it has served the interests of a few dozen large financial and industrial groups and their pressure groups. But the Prodi Commission now wants to transform the EU so that it can apply for joint global governance with the United States, which it also sees as its future competitor and rival. This new imperial policy advocates reorganising European and national institutions, strengthening the power of the state, increasing competition, establishing a European army and redistributing financial resources. Even daring to refer to the defence of a 'European social model' is a shamefaced lie because the more the EU combats the United States, the more it becomes its clone. We shall vote against these objectives, because we are fighting against this policy both in Parliament and on the streets. A European charter of fundamental rights would be the only ray of light in this policy but, yet again, there is no provision for the people of Europe themselves to be able to address and decide on this democratically. We abstained from the vote on the motion for a resolution for the following reasons. Firstly, the motion does not condemn clearly enough the vagueness of the priorities and commitments indicated in the Commission' s programme. Secondly, in terms of the definition of priorities for the next five years, we consider that the main question to be considered by the Commission is its role in interinstitutional relations within the EU which neither the programme nor the motion mention. In our opinion, the Commission' s role in the near future will be dependent on some of the European political initiative being returned by the governments of the Member States following the Santer Commission scandal. This is very positive as this is how the national parliaments, on which the governments depend, will continue to show that their democratic mandate is indispensable to European construction. The truth is that the European Parliament is still failing to gain the confidence and interest of national public opinion which is determined not to think about Europe, as demonstrated by the low turnout in the recent elections. The mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States must therefore be reinforced and made more coherent, more transparent and more democratic. We welcome the efforts of Mr Prodi to improve the public image of the Commission and the need for the latter to agree with this House and the Council. However, the priority should be to reform the governmental cooperation mechanisms, particularly by creating a Council of Ministers for Europe which, by itself and in coordination with the other European institutions, can assume the responsibility for transforming the political decisions of the European Councils into specific actions. Corrie report (A5-0032/2000) Madam President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly was coloured in 1999 by growing concern about the sustainability of the cooperation models derived from the Lomé Conventions. Back in 1994, the Joint Assembly passed an initial resolution, in which our fellow Member Dominique Souchet was closely involved, expressing its alarm at the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which contradicted the very principle of Community preference which was fundamental to this cooperation.	it
Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service. In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve. However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here. For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law. I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level. It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions. We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind. Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance. In addition, we must consider whether it is right and proper - and we have already had cases in which MEPs, not to mention groups, lodged a complaint against the European Parliament - for the Court of First Instance to be responsible for such cases, when in fact matters of a constitutional nature are affected and it makes more sense for such matters to be brought before the Court of Justice than before the Court of First Instance. On a final note, I too believe that OLAF requires monitoring under rule of law. As things stand, OLAF is in a vacuum and can do as it pleases. It is essential for OLAF to be monitored by a court. The only court that could reasonably do so would be the Court of First Instance. That would be another way of spurring the reform process on. Mr President, I would like to begin by joining those who congratulated the rapporteur on this work. The European Union is a system based on law. It must therefore have a system of courts to enforce that law. Furthermore, if the courts cannot deal appropriately and expeditiously with the legal workload placed on them, what happens, as Madame Palacio Vallelersundi has already pointed out, is that justice delayed becomes, as we know, justice denied. The evidence of the court is that that is happening now and it points to steps which can be taken now to alleviate the problem. However, as Mr Marinho has pointed out, more is necessary, but that has to wait for the IGC,	de
If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred. This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability. Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for. The regulations must therefore be reviewed, and I thank you, Commissioner, for highlighting the inadequate features of current European regulations. Moreover, as you said, monitoring must above all be stepped up: that of the flag state, that of the classification societies. You told us that RINA was an Italian classification register recognised by the Commission. What are the conditions for this recognition? What guarantees are there of its reliability? You are going to commission a fact-finding mission. We await the outcome with great interest. Inspections by the maritime authorities and supervision within European ports must also be tightened up. There is a Paris Memorandum in existence, let me remind you, which stipulates a minimum for inspection, that is, one in four of the vessels putting into European ports must be inspected by the maritime authorities of the country concerned. This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries. Why not? What conclusions has the Commission already drawn or what conclusions is it going to draw? I also think it essential to step up the level of inspection that the charterer is responsible for, in this case, the oil company. If the charterer' s liability entails a financial commitment, then doubtless the inspection will be enforced to a greater extent. Finally, we need some coordination of national maritime authorities in order to achieve some sort of European facility comparable to the coastguards who supervise the coasts of the United States. Firstly, I would like to thank the environment colleagues in my group who approached this particular problem jointly with their transport team. This disaster is both a transport and environmental one and is not confined to one area. Here we are here again in this Parliament discussing yet another maritime disaster. I could reel off the list of disasters that have afflicted this industry in my 10 years in this Parliament but I only have three minutes. Surely it is now about time that not only the Member States but that toothless tiger that is known as the International Maritime Organisation, and last but not least, the oil companies and tanker owners take on their responsibilities by acting to stop these ecological and human tragedies repeating themselves year after year. How many more Erikas do we have to endure before the powers that be deliver to us a proper port state control that is effective throughout the whole of the European Union, not just certain areas of it? How much more pollution do we have to endure before the industry delivers us tankers with segregated tanks and double holds?	fr
The world' s currency dealing centres will hardly agree to the tax revenue being used, for example, for a variety of well-meaning, UN-backed purposes throughout the world without a considerable amount of the revenue remaining with them. With regard to the Tobin tax as a means of preventing future currency crises, it has to be realised that the causes of a currency being overvalued cannot be averted through taxation. For that reason, as Mr Karas also said, we should give more attention to the policies that lead to a certain currency being overvalued in relation to its actual potential value. This again would require measures to regulate the exportation and importation of capital; otherwise it would not be possible to focus on policies in this way. Although it seems a reasonable scheme, the Tobin tax is not without its problems, even if there should be agreement as to its implementation, which I do not believe there will. It has to be remembered that money at present is first and foremost information, and that the global economy will, in the future, rotate more and more on the basis of information and intellectual capital. For that reason, the uninterrupted flow of assets in massive volumes between the world' s financial centres is not merely speculative activity, which has nothing to do with the real economy. If this 'feedback' mechanism, which gives users the opportunity to make choices, were hampered by measures such as the Tobin tax, mistaken decisions might be made that turned out to be so costly in terms of the economic consequences that the tax would never be able to make up for it. Hence, as Mr Karas has stated to his credit, our Group is resolutely opposed to the introduction of the Tobin tax. Madam President, I speak as someone who is in support of a tax on speculative capital movements across currency borders. It seems to me blindingly self-evident that some action is necessary. In the last 30 years, the volume of currency transactions has increased by 83 times: firstly, total global reserves of all central banks barely amounts to one day of foreign exchange trading; secondly, annual global trade in real goods and services equals just three-and-a-half days of foreign exchange markets out of 350, that is, 1% of capital movements are for trade in goods and services and 99% are for speculation. The size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets have made it harder and harder to manage national and regional economies. Computer-controlled selling programmes turned a random blip into an avalanche, burying jobs, lives and industries across the globe. The only arguments against it are: firstly, it would impair the efficiency of the foreign exchange market - a little fanciful in light of the financial feeding frenzies we have seen that have destroyed jobs throughout the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America. Mr Chirac has described those who engage in this as the Aids virus of the world economy. What is necessary is to throw some sand into the wheels of the currency speculators, stockbrokers and option traders. Of course, this cannot be done in one country; it cannot be done within the single currency area, but it could be done at international level with global cooperation.	it
We indeed take huge encouragement from the very positive and constructive response offered in the consultation over the last month and I believe therefore that although there may be a slight delay in the compilation and application of reforms, these reforms will nevertheless be strengthened by the extent of understanding and commitment that will be produced by the consultation which we will undertake assiduously. I would like everything to happen much more quickly. It is better to do it absolutely properly. Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock' s vision and sense of realism. For he is holding up visions of a well-oiled and effective administration and is, at the same time, drawing our attention to the difficulties which will arise and which can already be anticipated. Mr Prodi has pointed out that he would like to give up a few of his responsibilities. We will therefore need to focus on policy priorities first. I think it is more important to bring into focus what we want to achieve before we give up responsibilities, because I can imagine we could meet with a great deal of protest otherwise. Enlargement - that is enlargement of the Union - is one of the key challenges in this context. I would also like to point out that when it comes to keeping the peace, it will require a much greater effort to get a great many more people on board. We must resolutely switch from our present, rather bureaucratic approach which we are all familiar with - it pervades our development cooperation for example - to a cooperation for peace. Could Mr Kinnock say what timeframe he is expecting the Council and Parliament to come up with for these priorities? I am grateful to Mrs Maes for not only the comments that she has made now but the sustained commitment that she has shown to change ever since she came into this House. Can I assure her that our attitude is not guided by any motivation to farm out. We are concentrating on core tasks and we are concentrating on priorities, not in order to evade any obligations but to absolutely guarantee that we can totally fulfil the central obligations that we have. One of those obligations very clearly - and I am at one with Mrs Maes in this - is in the preparation for effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will work to the mutual benefit both of the people of the incoming countries and of the citizens of the current Union. One of the reasons for having to ensure that we focus very strongly and sharply on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we can fulfil that absolutely critical role of being the agents of enlargement to maximum effect. Can I say to her that the mechanisms that we are going to introduce of strategic planning and programming facilitated by activity-based management may sound to be immensely dry and completely bereft of any idealism. Since I was brought up to believe that the victory of ideals needs to be organised, I may be able to make an appeal to her to understand and support our mechanistic view of this because it is for the great and central purposes of the Union and its enlargement. I hope that, in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnership that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and with Parliament, not only will we get rapid implementation of policy development in the most effective way, but that we will be able to do it by coordination at the right time which will produce the maximum benefit for the Union.	de
We also need stricter criteria for interpreting the results of any monitoring. The most important parts of Parliament' s Amendments Nos 25 and 73 can therefore be approved in principle. The new definition in Amendment No 72 is, however, too strict and cannot be applied for this purpose. I would propose that Amendment No 92 should be incorporated into a broader solution. Amendment No 71 does not take account of seasonal variations and annual changes in the level of the groundwater. The proposal cannot therefore be approved. The Commission considers it unrealistic and unnecessary to lay down standards guaranteeing that the least intensive water purification is adequate to ensure that surface water is of drinking water quality. Instead, we prefer an addition to those measures which are required in accordance with Article 11 to promote activities in this area. The good status which is required under this proposal ought to guarantee that the demand for surface water of good quality is fulfilled. This part of Amendment No 41 cannot, therefore, be approved. The Commission appreciates Parliament' s efforts to guarantee that the so-called combined approach is given a central role. This approach and its scope, which the Commission can in principle approve, are defined by Amendments Nos 22 and 47. In order to achieve the greatest possible legal clarity and proportionality, we wish, however, to reformulate Amendment No 47 and to add a de minimis provision. The transfer of water is already covered by controls, but explicitly mentioning it makes the text clearer. These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 can, therefore, be approved. It is nonetheless unnecessary to make it a condition that all the measures for controlling demand should be adopted. The proposal already specifies that water must be abstracted in accordance with the ecological needs in the river basin district concerned. These parts of Amendments Nos 49 and 87 cannot, therefore, be approved. The Commission approves Amendment No 76 to the effect that radioactive substances are explicitly to be included in the proposal. To summarise, the Commission is able to approve 72 amendments, either in their entirety, partially or in principle. The following amendments cannot be approved: 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 71, 72, 74, 77, 79, 81, 83, 87, 89, 90, 91, 95, 97, 98, 100, 101, 103, 106 and 107. Finally, I want to say that I welcome the efforts which Parliament has made to try to solve the questions on which the Council takes other views. Important progress has been made, and the constructive tone of the discussions creates a good working climate for future discussions. A number of obstacles remain, but I am convinced that, as the legislative work progresses, we shall achieve our common goal of creating a water policy we can be proud of. Parliament' s adopting a clear position will be an important contribution to an ambitious, European water policy for the next three decades. I would like to hear the Commissioner's view on Amendment No 45.	fr
As it happens - and I would like to add this for the sake of the Netherlands - negotiations on this matter have taken place at an earlier stage. The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result. Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes. I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot. Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas. A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind. Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy. So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention. I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen. I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect. However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary. We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies. This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000. All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business. Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture. I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart. Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council. It is shameful! That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union! When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end.	de
The Commission' s communication, which we are discussing today and which was put by for a decision by the Council in November, is a well-balanced report on how we can obtain a more professional debate and more knowledge of the challenges faced by the Member States in the field of social policy over the next few years when we have ageing populations and are experiencing the effects of the enlargement of the Union. We now already have major social problems and major social costs to find from the public budgets, which is a problem for many Member States. If reforms are not got under way, we are in danger of eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is now undoubtedly the most secure basis for effective social security. It is therefore only reasonable to put these subjects on the agenda. In the debate about coordination of social policy in the EU, we often use the expression social convergence. As liberals, we can support this concept when it means that we in the EU are to establish broad common objectives with which the individual countries then seek to comply by means of their own national social policies. It is not, therefore, about harmonisation but about common objectives. It is, of course, a fact that the EU countries have different ways of organising social policy. We have different traditions and there are differences in culture and, in spite of there being many points of similarity, there are also major differences between one country and another in the nature and extent of the social problems concerned. It is therefore important to emphasise that social policy is a national concern. National policy is, of course, subject to a number of common parameters. That is the case with minimum social entitlements, which are established by treaty. It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation. So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means. I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report. I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste. I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries. I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold.	fr
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters. I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints. I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government. You may answer the question. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me. I have given you my answer. I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed. We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive. I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation. It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible. I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today. As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December. I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it. I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention. I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections. It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again. I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks. Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable? This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related. Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union.	de
Now we are being asked to provide the legal base for such interception, and it is the combination of these two documents that should be looked at. The requirements propose to allow the authorities access to the facilities of all service providers, that is, telephones, mobile phones, Internet, etc.; and given the current extremely shoddy drafting, this is open to abuse. I would also like to ask: given that the user requirements specify that the police has access to all service providers without exception, does this include Parliament' s in-house service? Are we adopting rules that will allow the police access to our own systems on very, very shoddy grounds? Furthermore, in this proposal there is no threshold for serious offences. This leaves it wide open to abuse. Again as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something which is recognised in international, fundamental law, the presumption of innocence is essential. That is not guaranteed. Neither the preamble nor the body of the text takes proper account of the rights of the defence, a basic principle of international fundamental rights. This issue is extremely serious. We are very concerned about the direction we are taking here without proper public debate within the national parliaments or elsewhere and without the involvement of civil liberties organisations throughout Europe which are extremely concerned about these developments. Mr President, I am neither a member of the Legal Affairs Committee nor a lawyer, but like almost all of us, I understand the need for this Single Economic Area of Europe to have its parallel in a single area of freedom, security and justice. In that sense, the issues of judicial cooperation in matters of criminal law are important. What did I understand on reading the related texts? That it is dangerous to rely on the provisions made by the Council. The many contradictions and conflicting views over what Europe is and the many different legal systems could not only lead to confusion and inefficiency but also create dangerous situations. For example, the situation proposed by Article 18, to which many speakers have drawn attention, where each country, each large country if you will, each country with the technical ability, can enter another country and monitor its telecommunications without even securing the second country' s approval. In my opinion, the Legal Affairs Committee and the rapporteur Mr Di Pietro have produced some very interesting work. It is a pity that this very well constructed explanatory statement by Mr Di Pietro could not be conveyed in the telegrammatic five minutes he had here today. Nevertheless, it is a move towards protecting the rights of countries, defendants and citizens, a path which I think must be pursued much more completely and much more boldly. I should like, however, to draw your attention to the fact that all this is taking place in a framework in which there is confusion and a schizophrenic attitude about criminal law. A child, a student or a pupil who smokes hashish in one country is dealt with in an educational way, while in another country he is treated as a criminal and locked up in the universities of crime constituted by the corrective system and the prisons.	de
It is perhaps not by chance that the Conservative benches have emptied because that which is represented as market freedom no longer has anything in common with the noble principles of the social market economy which has brought so much prosperity to us here in western Europe over recent decades. If we continue down this path, and this is the ideology, and declare the financial markets to be sacrosanct and even claim that any intervention in the workings of these markets is contrary to progress and contrary to the growth of the economy, then we will quite certainly be on the wrong tack and that could take on quite dangerous proportions. Those who own the monetary assets are currently amassing huge fortunes which are again screaming out to be reinvested. We have asset inflation of global proportions. As a result, speculative bubbles continually arise on the financial markets, causing growing economic instability which, in turn, jeopardises the entire economy. And it is precisely the medium-sized undertakings and large numbers of employees who suffer as a result. We can take action against this; it is possible. The minimum requirements for this would be for a proper study to be carried out at long last, not only by the Commission, but by reputable economic institutes throughout Europe. That too is feasible. And then perhaps everyone will stop bandying about arguments which are asking for trouble! It is not correct that the Tobin tax is technically impracticable - it is quite feasible in the age of the computer. The fact that tax havens are frequently nothing but hard disk storage space for large European banks here at home must not be ignored. In short, we must not allow real capital and speculative capital to become so remote from each other, because otherwise we shall be steering towards situations which we experienced on this continent time and again during the last century and which had catastrophic results. Madam President, let us indeed tax money speculation: it does not produce anything new. The tax would be targeted at the right place: at the speculators. Who is going to defend these speculators, when nurses and teachers are paying top rates of tax? Article 73 c of the Treaty establishing the European Union provides scope for taxation on transactions. Those who oppose taxation on currency dealing are in favour of those tax-recycling centres, the tax havens, of which there are 62 in all. The Union should make a tax pact, which any countries could initially be party to. The low rate Tobin tax would not cause tax-recycling problems. It is strange to claim that if everyone is not included it would be impossible to bring into effect. The European Union was founded through the efforts of just a few countries, and you see how we are today. The truth is the greatest problem is a political one: they do not want to tax capital, but raise personal taxation instead. In the end tax would politicise the global, undemocratic system of financial power.	es
He said that globalisation is a positive phenomenon, and I share his view. I believe that globalisation has helped many countries which, so far, have been on the sideline of the world trade streams to participate in these and be incorporated into the world trade system and, as far as I am aware, no country has ever been worse off by participating in international trade. In other words, as indeed already remarked by Mr Gasòliba, globalisation is, in my view, positive, and I am of the opinion that it has contributed to a new international distribution of labour which has been pursued by many people for many years. A second remark made by Mr Gasòliba was that there is currently no evidence that the Tobin tax will stabilise the exchange rates. I think that he is correct in this regard. I too am not aware of any reason why a tax on exchange rate transactions would lead to a stabilisation of exchange rates. I am of the opinion that these are two important remarks, and that is why I am reiterating them here. Madam President, could I furthermore point out that none of the speakers this evening has drawn a link between the Tobin tax on the one hand and the functioning of the European Union on the other? Surely we are all familiar with the Treaty of Rome and know that one of the four freedoms is the freedom of capital movement. Madam President, I can assure your Parliament that my day-to-day work consists partly of attempting, in conjunction with my offices and colleagues, to completely integrate the financial markets within Europe, thus enabling financial transactions to run as easily and smoothly as possible. In my capacity as Commissioner for the Internal Market, I am, in other words, opposed to all measures which hamper international financial transactions. You could hardly expect this Commissioner to agree with a tax which would, in fact, impede international economic movement. Once again, the Tobin tax is, in my view, at odds with the Treaty of Rome, and this is an important, theoretical objection which has not been considered by any of the speakers this evening. Madam President, apart from these - to my mind - quite fundamental observations, there are also practical objections to the Tobin tax, as already underlined by Mr Karas and other speakers. It has unfortunately been observed, I have to say, that the European Union has failed to reach agreement internally on specific tax measures. This indicates how difficult these dossiers are. If we have not been able to reach agreement internally, I wonder whether we will then be able to convince the other trade partners. I think that this will be problematic. Madam President, Mr Jonckheer has stated that this could be one of the measures for stabilising the financial markets. I think, however, that instability is merely a symptom and that we should be looking at the underlying causes. I think that it is preferable to fight the causes rather than attempt to tackle the symptoms when this is probably not possible and when, as already stated, the measure concerned is pretty certainly at odds with the Treaty of Rome. In order to remove these causes, one has to look at what is happening in the countries in question. Is it the case that these countries can boast of what is termed in English 'good governance' ? Is it the case that there is low inflation and that there are low interest rates? That the markets for production factors, including the labour market, operate flexibly? That is not always the case. So if we want to look into what causes exchange rate instability, then we need to take into account the elements of good governance and focus on these first.	de
The European Union voted against that motion. The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion. It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote. The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution. This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative. This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future. It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000. In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close. It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution. In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing. The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view. The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part. The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	es
Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport. As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end. The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day. In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety. In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved. Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport. But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem. I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)]. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation. Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive. In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments. I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job. In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today. Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty.	it
Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council. The project has been long and problematic. In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources. Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects. One example is the use of peat. Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned. It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal. The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy. Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement. Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy. The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate. We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future. The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner. We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come. For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy. Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme. Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report. I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan. For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee. However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout. Mr Langen mentioned that a series of Parliament' s demands and points it had to make relating to content were adopted and - as has already been mentioned - we were almost able to meet the Council halfway on even the most contentious point, that of the financing for this multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community. This is not satisfactory - I would like to make that quite clear. However, we agreed to this compromise because it was important to us to enable this programme to be launched very soon indeed. For in the course of the next few years, the proportion of renewable energy sources is to double, accounting for at least 12% of energy consumption. This is the European Union' s declared aim. That being the case, since ALTENER is the only EU programme to have the exclusive aim of promoting renewable energy sources, it will certainly be have a key role. In the first place, this new five-year programme will entail extending the actions in the ALTENER I programme. This will include extending the exchange of information and expertise between operators in the renewable energy sources sector, developing local and regional energy agencies, and establishing new networks for approving financial support, to name but a few examples.	de
Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective. As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency. The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues. The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid. A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more. It is widely known that a significant proportion of aid is today granted under the Member States' national policies, which are not always complementary or well coordinated. A great deal of the waste and inefficiency associated with aid from the European Union and its Member States is the result of precisely this lack of coordination and complementarity between the actions of individual Member States and the proposals and actions of the European institutions. In this respect it is also absolutely vital that we should do our utmost, as soon as possible, to create stronger mechanisms for ensuring that the policies adopted by the Member States and European Union policies are coordinated and complementary. The third aspect I would like to highlight is the strengthening and coherence of EU policies, the central theme of today' s debate. Firstly, we are all aware that it is not enough just to improve aid conditions and that there is a need for better coordination with other European Union policies, so that development objectives can be achieved, not merely through aid and support, but also, first and foremost, through a more integrated approach to the various different policies that contribute to the objectives of development. As you know, a Council Resolution was approved, in June 1997, under which the Commission was required to present evaluation reports. The first such report was presented to the Council in May 1999, and it referred to certain aspects of policy coordination, notably in the fields of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration. But as you will also be aware, we are waiting for a Commission communication on coherence, together with the communication on development policy. Over the coming months, that is to say during the Portuguese Presidency, this debate will of course be enriched by the contributions that the Commission has undertaken to present to us. It is evident that the scope for achieving coherence between policies will always be limited and it is only natural for there to be some contradictions between policies as these are means of balancing and weighting the contradictory and conflicting interests within the European Union. Only in this way is it possible to manage some degree of contradiction between policies.	es
"In any case, it is prevention that I would like to discuss today. War is threatening to break out again in the Gulf. As you know, the Iraqi Government has refused to abide by United Nations Resolution 1284, and this is likely to lead, within the next six or seven weeks, to a refusal to issue entrance visas to the committee monitoring the destruction of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons. If this happens, the United States' Government and the British Government have given it to be understood that they will resort to military intervention. A visit to Iraq and meetings with the Iraqi leaders and leading figures, particularly Mr Tarek Aziz, convinced me that there is actually a possibility of persuading the Iraqi Government to cooperate in enforcing Resolution 1284. However, the responsible authorities of the Western countries need to make it clear that, once the mission of the United Nations committee has been successfully completed, the embargo will be lifted and normal trade relations will be able to be resumed. I would like to know what you and Europe are doing, Mr Solana, or what you intend to do in the near future, to stave off this threat of war. Today, we have the chance to prevent it; tomorrow it may be too late. I would also like to know whether, in this context, it would not be possible to do something to induce the Iraqi Government to take a humanitarian step and to release some information regarding the 615 missing Kuwaitis, or to set them free if this is within their power. Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, with regard to the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly restrained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general and of the European Union in particular. Now, what has happened and what is still happening in Chechnya is similar to genocide. How else can we describe the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400 000 inhabitants, the unremitting and inordinate bombing of towns, villages and districts where, in amongst the whole of the civilian population, there are perhaps a handful of Chechen fighters? How should we describe the sinister filtration camps, which are comparable to concentration camps, in which the population is suffering the most dreadful humiliation and from which able-bodied men between 15 and 65 years old rarely get out alive? How can we describe the rapes, the looting, the deliberate fires, the deportations, which are called ""cleansing"" , that recall the worst episodes of the Middle Ages in Europe? And what can we say about the leaden shroud that is crashing down on Russian and international journalists and with the banishment of the humanitarian organisations and any international commission of inquiry at the sites of the massacres? If that is realpolitik, if we really do not have any means, Mr Solana, as High Representative of the CFSP, and Commissioner, I put this question to you both, let us at least use the means that we do have, namely, the aid programmes to Russia."	es
Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices. Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that. Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid. I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration. As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market. I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid. Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules. Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need. We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products. In other words, we must succeed in linking the competition criteria that are necessary to the economy with those relating to managerial economics. I often have the impression, unlike the country I come from - former East Germany - where economic competitiveness is prized above all else and competitiveness relating to managerial economics is disregarded, that very often the reverse is the case; society thinks almost exclusively in terms of managerial economics. I say that as an entrepreneur who has a vested interest in this. But a system cannot function in this way: it will only work if the two aspects go hand in hand.	es
In the postal sector the first phase is already in progress, as the universal service providers have embarked on a process of modernisation. The new technologies and logistics rather than the process of postal liberalisation are the most important factors impacting on employment. On the availability of the studies, - a point raised by Mr Staes and others - copies of each of the studies were handed to Parliament in September 1999. They have all been available on the Commission' s Internet website since August 1999 and the Commission is willing to provide copies to anybody who is interested. The studies have been the object of some criticism, especially on the part of the public postal services. I am aware that all the studies launched experienced difficulty in collecting adequate data. This was no surprise, since the universal service operators do not always have the systems in place for detailed letter collection. Does that not say a lot about management ability? No single methodology for accessing the cost and financing of the universal service is accepted by all the parties. Nevertheless, Mr Bolkestein is convinced that the studies undertaken provide enough clarity and precision to form the basis of the decision-making process. I finally come to three interventions about a subject I am supposed to know better than postal services, that is competition. Mr Purvis, I found your methodologically provocative remark about the tender interesting and certainly worth exploring. Mr Medina Ortega, I am as convinced as you are that we must be even more vigilant after liberalisation, because we do not want the disappearance of public monopolies to give rise, through unchecked concentration, to private operators. This applies both to the post and other sectors. If I can provide one example of this sort of vigilance, it is the case of Deutsche Post where, following complaints and an action before the court, the Commission initiated a formal state aid procedure in July. We have just received the reply of the German Government to the observations made. The state aid procedure covers the question of cross-subsidisation between monopoly letter services and commercial business parcel activities as well as the financing of Deutsche Post' s numerous recent acquisitions. I will not go into the details due to lack of time, but this is perhaps one illustration of the fact that the Commission does not stop its work as liberalisation progresses. In a sense this is where its work begins. Finally, Mr Radwan, of course, there should be limits to competition and there are limits to competition. In particular, if we take the issue of competition and services of general interest, where a Member State defines a mission of public service, it is important to quantify the costs for discharging that mission and state aids that compensate for those costs are certainly not a violation of competition. I would slightly disagree with the terminology you used when you said, Mr Radwan, that it is time for the needs of citizens to be taken into account rather than exclusively the need for competition.	fr
Mr President, nine million cars are shredded and scrapped every year in Europe. Even though they can no longer be driven, these nine million cars may still be traded and moved across borders; and not just intra-Community borders, but also those outside the Union. It is therefore only right that the European Union should draw up Community rules on how these nine million vehicles every year are to be recycled and processed. We believe that the directive has a few weaknesses that we in the House should work on to produce a directive which is genuinely ground-breaking. We therefore have a number of amendments. I personally believe that the scope of the directive goes beyond its objective. I do not think it is necessary for classic cars to be part of the directive. Nor do I think that motorcycles should be included, as the distinctive culture of recycling within the motorcycle industry obviates the need for a European directive in this area. I am not looking for such rigidly high recycling quotas when it comes to special-purpose vehicles either. I want special-purpose vehicles such as ambulances to have high recovery quotas. This is my main concern in this matter. In my opinion, the directive solidly regulates the matter of accountability for how a car is disposed of in Europe. This can be left as the Commission has proposed with the Member States ensuring the appropriate collection points for draining cars. This will involve, for example, disposing of more than 32 million lots of used oil, removing break fluid, etc. An important part of this directive is the issue of what to do with used parts. What should we do with the shredded products? We should not overlook the fact that, although quotas are an important point in recycling and recovery, they are by no means the only point. Do not forget that, in the case of cars, 80% of environmental impact comes through driving, 1% through recovery and 19% through construction. Quotas are not, therefore, the only parameter in the matter of environmental compatibility, just one of many. Of course we need to aim high, but quotas must not become an end in themselves. We must understand that the bigger picture is important when it comes to the environmental impact of cars. I am far keener to see us move away from today's car, weighing 1,400 kg and driving an average of 200,000 km, to a future car capable of driving the same distance but weighing just 1,000 kg. This would at least mean 400 kg times 200,000 km less transportation. This would represent real environmental progress because it would lead to a large reduction in CO2 which, if I have rightly understood the Kyoto Protocol, is the important factor. We therefore consider that, in future, vehicles which clearly and effectively use lightweight construction methods will produce less CO2 and should receive preferential treatment in their combustion quotas. It should not be for each Member State, but for you and your staff, Commissioner, to decide whether these lightweight construction vehicles (and there is also talk of 3-litre vehicles) should receive preferential treatment.	it
This too is characteristic of American society, which hears little about it. They get het up about wars and genocide on other continents, but wrongly keep quiet about the genocide taking place in their own country. Today, the Dineh Indians are facing their final fight for their right to land, for their right to dignity and, above all, for their right to their way of life. There are few of them left and they are up against a very powerful, economic adversary. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, I endorse the many comments which have been made by the previous speakers, but I would like to emphasise a few things. The Dineh people belong to the North-American Navajo Indians. They are facing expulsion and have been fighting a battle of survival for dozens of years. They have been living in harrowing living conditions for years. The deprived conditions in which they are living at the moment is forcing them to compromise against their better judgement under the financial and economic pressure exercised by the coal industries. The Relocation Act, which was introduced in 1974 and aims to re-distribute the land of the Navajo reservation, authorised the relocation of the peoples. This relocation is, of course, unacceptable because human rights are being violated in economic, social and cultural terms. The Dineh Indians are being moved like pawns and, in that way, lose not only their past and the land which is so extremely important to them - the land of their forefathers - but also any prospect of work and sources of income. The Relocation Act was pushed through in Congress by a group representing the coal mining industry. Congress never questioned where the people living in the area would have to move to or how relocation would impact on their lives. The population was not allowed any input. This resembles a kind of trade in human beings. The relocation scheme was implemented and the Dineh people were moved to an area contaminated by uranium. After the collapse of the dam in New Mexico in 1979, which resulted in the spill of 370 000 cubic metres of radioactive water and eleven hundred tonnes of pure uranium, this place is one of the world' s most contaminated areas. The United States administration, the coal industry and all of us need to acquit ourselves of our responsibility and provide a sound alternative: either the soil is cleaned or the Dineh Indians are allocated a proper place where provision is made for all kinds of support, be it in the psychological, social, cultural or budgetary field. It is high time we respected the rights of the Indians. This is why we ask you to vote for this resolution: we in Europe should not be intimidated by American interests which are being pushed by financial, religious and industrial groups. So let us contact the United States now! Mr President, in terms of human rights, there is of course a great deal amiss in Chechnya. We have received reports from human rights organisations saying that Russian soldiers killed and apparently even executed citizens - I am talking about old men and women - in Grozny. Citizens are believed to have been burnt alive in air-raid shelters. We insist that these violations of human rights are investigated. Despite the pledges made, violations in, for example, Alfanyurt have still not been investigated. International government organisations and non-governmental organisations must be allowed access, and the Union' s general Council decided on 6 December 1999 to send representatives from the Member States to Ingushetia to study the humanitarian situation there.	de
"Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add). In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run. This has led to an increase in the number of women involved in political decision making which, in turn, has provided opportunities for further research. What happens when more women take an active and equal part in political decision making? What has so far emerged is that the agenda has changed - and when the agenda changes, so too of course do the types of decisions made. When the talk turns to quota allocation by gender, the word ""qualifications"" also crops up. What is interesting is that the qualifications demanded are rarely defined. It often looks as if men today, as in the past, always have the least defined qualifications. Being a man therefore seems, in itself, to be synonymous with maximum competence. This way of seeing things I consider to be proof of spectacular incompetence on the part of many of today' s decision makers. Earlier this year, we requested, here in this Chamber, that 8 March be made into an international holiday. In anticipation of this request being met, I now want to take the opportunity of wishing all socialist women success with the ""Women' s World Marches"" which are to begin this spring on International Women' s Day. This is a world-wide activity which will focus upon violence against women and female poverty throughout the world. Finally, I want to say, as Commissioner Patten said when he drew the previous debate to a close, that the ideal police officer would be a black grandmother. We do not have any such officers, but black grandmothers are in fact to be found. Mr President, the place of women in politics is an important matter that is worthy of more than our trying to outbid each other in terms of political correctness. Undoubtedly there are too few women involved in politics. It is not absolutely certain that the predominance of men in the party machinery alone is responsible. In France, 95% of elected representatives are town councillors. The vast majority of them are not members of any party. In the authorities of the French departments, the leading French party is that of independent elected representatives, in right-wing or left-wing categories. In order to be elected as a local councillor, you just have to want to be elected. But access to national responsibilities often depends upon the introduction to politics provided by such local mandates. Our Group wants to encourage the fair representation of men and women in the institutions of the European Union. That is why we reject the policy of quotas and positive discrimination, whether it is in favour of women or supposed social minorities. The policy of minorities, while neglecting the deep-seated unity of the human family, to establish superficial divisions, is a dangerous threat to the cohesion of the social fabric and the equilibrium of our democratic system."	it
Question No 3 by (H-0027/00): Subject: Indictment of NATO before War Crimes Tribunal Human rights organisations, such as the US Human Rights Watch, have already collected significant evidence of NATO crimes in connection with the bombing of Kosovo and Serbia with a view to bringing a case before the War Crimes Tribunal in The Hague. On the basis of this evidence, some of which has already been lodged with the Tribunal, NATO is accused of 'serious violations of international humanitarian law' and 'wilful murder'. Does the Council consider that such accusations should be put before the War Crimes Tribunal for a thorough judicial investigation? In the event of a judicial inquiry into the accusations against NATO, what will be done in respect of the High Representative for the CFSP, who was NATO Secretary-General during the crisis? Is there any procedure for suspending him from office until the judicial investigation into the accusations has been completed? Mr President, Mr Alavanos' question naturally gives us food for thought on a wide range of issues. The Council has already, on various occasions, stated its conviction that the severe measures taken by NATO were both necessary and justified to deal with extremist and irresponsible actions involving clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions. I am aware that there may be different views about NATO' s action and the legitimacy of that action. Everyone is free to hold such views. In my own country, the various parliamentary groups had differing views on this matter. That was how it was. In any case, the Council' s position is clear in that it considers that the objective of the air campaign carried out by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was to put an end to the humanitarian disaster in Kosovo caused by the Belgrade regime. This objective was fully and formally expressed in the statement adopted by the General Affairs Council in Luxembourg on 8 April. I must say that these NATO measures were not taken lightly and were only carried out as a last resort when it became evident that all avenues for reaching a negotiated solution had been exhausted and that the Belgrade authorities were concentrating their forces in order to expel the Kosovo Albanians from their land. I am sure you are aware, Mr Alavanos, that, during her recent visit to NATO headquarters, Prosecutor Del Ponte stressed that the International Tribunal was obliged to examine all accusations presented to it, including those made against NATO, in particular by pacifist groups from Canada. This compulsory examination was to be carried out in line with accusations submitted. In any case, I have with me a statement made by Prosecutor Del Ponte according to which NATO is not at present under any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia and there is no formal inquiry process concerning NATO' s actions in the Kosovo conflict. All information received during the past six months, either from individuals or from groups requesting an investigation of NATO' s actions during the Kosovo conflict, have been recorded by the Prosecutor. Any other information will of course be analysed by the Prosecutor, who will in due course decide whether or not there is cause for action.	de
There are a few points at stake tomorrow. Firstly, we know that the ship is the most environmentally friendly mode of transport for carrying passengers and goods. At the same time we know that ships make a hefty contribution to polluting the sea with rubbish, cargo residues and oily slime. The fuel used by ships happens to be heavy oil and we know that this heavy oil leaves a residue of between 1% and 3% as oily slime, which is typically discharged into the sea. I think that we agree that ships have to dispose of waste and residues in port. It follows - and in fact there is no other logical conclusion - that the cardinal rule for clean seas is that it must no longer be worthwhile for waste to be disposed of illegally on the high seas. This is what this is about, and a majority of us have said as much in debates here. In January we had a very thorough debate with you, Commissioner, on the consequences of the Erika disaster. On this occasion we once again drew together all the points on ship safety and clean seas. And this directive on port reception facilities for cargo residues is, of course, also about the question of how to make our seas cleaner. Just for information, we know that 70 000 m3 of detritus is illegally discharged into the North Sea alone every year and, conversely, we know that at present a maximum of 5% to 10% of ships obey the rules and dispose of their waste in port. This scandal is not acceptable in the eyes of the Council either. The Council is after all also saying that all ports must have appropriate port reception facilities available and must be equipped with them. The conflict now is ultimately over the issue of how payments will be made. In its first reading, Parliament said by a large majority that the ships must make a significant contribution, of at least 90%. And therein lies the difference with the Council, which is saying that a contribution has to be made. But a contribution might also only mean half a euro and in this case God knows this would be too little. Nothing would change. There would be no financial pressure on ships to obey the rules. What is needed is a standard waste disposal fee for all ships irrespective of how much they actually use the disposal facilities, meaning that the financial incentive to dispose of waste at sea has to be removed, which - as has already been explained here today - was possible in the Baltic Sea through the HELCOM Agreement and the 'no-special-fee' system. If it can be done there it must also be possible for it to work for the remaining European seas, because this is not only about the environment: it is about clean waters, it even has consequences for tourism and - the decisive point - alongside the environmental issue it is also about fair competition. The same conditions must apply to all ships in port and only if Parliament, the Council and the Commission create these conditions together will this fair competition be restored for ports and ships. I think that this is also about the credibility of the Union and, in particular, Parliament. I think that people are tired of seeing the hypocrisy of Europe and of ministers each time that there is a catastrophe, as we saw of course with 'Erika' .	de
Examples have been given in Spain of Michelin and ABB-Alsthom and my colleagues will give examples for Italy. There is also another hidden way of making workers redundant, as practised for example in Spain by the Ericsson company under the term 'externalising' . Note that sensitive words like 'redundancy' are not used. Externalising services by subcontracting these to contract companies results in stable and permanent jobs being turned into precarious jobs without union or social rights. This is just an underhand way of making workers redundant. Commissioner, if the European institutions really believe in what they say about full employment, they must take clear steps to secure this. They must revise the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations. They must revise the directive on collective redundancies, reduce the working day, link European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social and labour clauses in the international agreements signed by the European Union. Mr President, sadly, once again, Parliament is having to discuss the restructuring of companies in Europe. Yet again, workers are likely to lose their jobs. This time, I am referring to the workers of the company Goodyear in Cisterna di Latina. As has already been pointed out, in one month' s time, 600 people and as many families could be deprived of their sole source of income. Despite the commitment they have shown to the company and despite their high level of professionalism - which has made the Cisterna plant one of the most productive in Europe - these workers are likely to be removed from the production cycle, while Goodyear, after years of benefiting from state and European subsidies, is totally free to walk out. I do not think this is at all fair, either to the workers at the Cisterna plant or to all those Italian and European citizens whose taxes have, albeit indirectly, enabled Goodyear to benefit from the state aids I have just mentioned. The European Commission and the Council must, at last, assume all the necessary responsibilities, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on the information and consultation of workers and with regard to Community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies who undertake to establish long-term agreements to protect jobs. Today, we ask the Commission to start by protecting the workers at Goodyear in Cisterna, and therefore to put as much pressure as possible on the company for it to come to an agreement as soon as possible, thereby ensuring the continued existence and operation of the Cisterna plant. Mr President, Commissioner, I would also like to remind the House that there is very little time available, and therefore that any measure - including those already cited by the Commission in its introductory report - which we adopt must have an immediate, timely effect. Mr President, Commissioner, as far as restructuring goes, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt so that they are better placed to face new challenges or go under. We are well aware of this current economic context and that the purpose of restructuring is to rationalise corporate management.	de
"If we believe in the principle of equal representation of women and men in decision making we need to commit ourselves to the actions that are necessary to make it happen. Mr President, at the Second International Conference of Socialist Women held in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided that the main demand of the time, that of a woman' s right to vote, should be linked to the women' s question as a whole and that (as also stated in the relevant resolution) Women' s Day must be accorded an international dimension and be thoroughly prepared for. It is also worth noting that International Women' s Day has since been banned in all those countries in which fascism and racism came to power during and between the war years. In 1910, a woman' s right to vote was on the agenda. Today, we are focusing upon the ways in which more women might be able to participate in the decision-making process. Women are no homogenous collective. Women belong to different social classes. Women have different individual needs and interests. Irrespective of where we are and notwithstanding our class, race or religion and whether we stay at home or go out to work, it is nonetheless a fact that, in all areas of society, the structures are such that we are thoroughly subordinate to men (albeit with a few individual exceptions, it is perhaps best to add). In my own country, Sweden, a number of political parties have, in recent years, voluntarily introduced quota allocation by gender as a feature governing the ways in which political assemblies are constituted and run.

Having withdrawn the budget line for 'natural disasters affecting Member States' with such poor timing, Europe has a duty to respond, firstly in the name of solidarity but also because it shares responsibility in this umpteenth oil slick disaster. European citizens find it hard to understand why Europe accepts conditions which the Americans refuse and why Europe, normally so quick to pass environmental legislation, has until now blocked any measures to do with maritime safety. Europe must pass legislation at the earliest possible opportunity and investigate the matter of this wreck thoroughly, but, in the meantime, the Commission must, as a matter of urgency, harness European funds to aid the businesses affected in order to deal with the wreck, clean up the coastline, increase the capacity of waste storage facilities, ensure that waste is processed or recycled, and set up a research programme into the recovery of oil spilt at sea. Finally, the Commission must reintroduce an appropriate budget line for 'natural disasters involving Member States' , and make the regions affected eligible for Structural Funds. What is the Commission' s view of these proposals? What decisions has the Commission already taken and what decisions does it plan to take? How did the Commission follow up the resolution which the European Parliament adopted on 20 January 2000? We have not, thus far, seen any practical action whatsoever. Mr President, echoing the thoughts of a number of Members, I should like to tell you that, two and a half months after the wreck, the situation remains particularly critical and every day the scale of the disaster becomes even more apparent. There are two aspects, the first being the environmental angle. The wreck still contains 16 000 tonnes of heavy gas oil which is leaking and, in addition to these leaks, unfortunately, last week we observed and counted 35 acts of ecological piracy, 35 degassing operations, disgracefully aggravating this already catastrophic situation. Mrs de Palacio expressed her views at length regarding this issue and I feel she set to work without waiting for an element which today is absolutely essential, a draft European maritime law, following a draft directive on the maritime transportation of dangerous goods. From this point of view, this fits in with the wish of the French to see their presidency characterised by regulations which work towards increasing safety. The secondary impact, however, is proving to be on the economy, the primary impact being environmental and only the second economic, as many Members have stated. Shellfish farming, fishing, oyster farming and fish farming are today seriously affected, for the effects of the oil slick have been compounded by the storm damage affecting many areas. Unfortunately, these sectors have been devastated: they have first to rebuild and then, perhaps the most difficult thing, to regain consumer confidence. Confronted with this situation, the inhabitants of Brittany, the Vendée and Charente, as well as the forestry workers in other regions, await a signal from the European Union. We cannot claim that rapprochement with the citizens is the touchstone of this legislative period if, at the same time, we hold our tongues and do not offer practical responses in the face of phenomena of this magnitude.	it
"We are not just calling for more control, and more control over Europol; our motto here is ""Less is sometimes more!"" With most of Europol employees currently engaged in self-control for the purposes of data protection laws and questions being asked by 15 national parliaments, we may have a great deal of control, but it is inefficient control. We want less confusing control and more parliamentary control by the European Parliament, without hampering the work of Europol. At the same time, we support the establishment of a European police academy as suggested in Tampere as a step in the right direction. Thirdly: the extension to Parliament' s rights in this context. If the establishment of such an area, in which the Union can also intervene in the basic rights of the citizens, is only decided by diplomats and bureaucrats, while the elected representatives of Europe are reduced to following developments like a rabbit watching a snake, then this area will not gain the acceptance of the citizens. There is therefore an urgent need to grant Parliament codecision rights in this respect and, as we have already said, to strengthen the principle of democratic control. We want an area of freedom, security and justice for the citizens of Europe, not against them. Mr President, I have nothing further to say to the Council. The previous speaker has quoted me from the last committee meeting and said it all! Why does the Council find it so hard to work with us in creating an area of freedom, security and justice? I find this question more and more worrying. Allow me to try and elucidate it a little from my point of view. The establishment of an area of freedom, security and justice hovers at the interface between the constituent elements of national sovereignty. The police and judicial policy are quite clearly elements of sovereignty, in other words sensitive political areas in the Member States, and shifting the interface of these and communitising these policies, i.e. delegating powers from the national capitals, from Lisbon, Berlin or Paris, to Brussels represents a transfer of power. Of course it is very, very difficult to break away from the executive forms which have been handed down to us, even if we recognise that police cooperation is necessary; we can only fight international crime at European level. So we have to draw our conclusions and say that we need legal and organisational communitisation of the instruments available. As a result, the governments which need to do this and which recognise that need, also realise that, in implementing this, they are taking away their own powers. Then there is the European Parliament, which is also complicated. In the final analysis, however, we must find a way forward, because if we carry on as we have in the past, and with last year' s experience, then what will happen is that the security debate and the debate about citizens' rights will be marginalised in the national parliaments as a result of making it a half national, half European structure."	es
I have evidence that this is possible. The majority of you hold these debates in your constituencies and regions. Although this may seem rather egotistical, I want the Commission, in the minds of the people, to have a face and for those people forming the Commission to be able to meet our citizens as often as possible. Mr President, I welcome Mr Barnier' s commitment to go to the regions, both to explain and to listen to what citizens have to say. I would like to invite him to my own region of Yorkshire, a major European region that is a full participant in the single European market and a major recipient of European structural funding. He can come with both the hats that he wears as a Commissioner. I would like to ask him how vigorous the Commission will be in this information campaign? In some Member States it is not just a matter of providing information to a public that is not as well informed as it might be. That is certainly important but it is also a question of combating the misinformation that is put around by a very active anti-European movement and anti-European organisations that exist. The Commission will have to be very vigorous in the responses that it puts out to some of the comments that it will be receiving as part of the campaign. Mr Corbett, thank you for your comments. I willingly accept your invitation. If I have understood you correctly, you want me, when I come to Yorkshire, to talk not only about the reform of the European institutions but also the Structural Funds. I can perform this dual task. I forgot to mention my intention to go before the national parliaments, as I have already done, not only by meeting their representatives here but by going to see them in situ. Ten days ago I was in Westminster, so you can see, Mr Corbett, that I am not afraid of the difficulties. Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin. I have already appeared before the French Senate. Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too. With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication. I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion. I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate. Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with. It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself. In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting.	it
It is not your job, it is our job to decide on that. It also has something to do with the newly awoken self-consciousness of this Parliament. I just want to discuss it with you, no more and no less. We can do so without going off at other tangents. I respect you as a serious Commissioner who wants to take his work seriously. Please respect us as Members of Parliament who want to take our work seriously, and that includes the Tobin tax! Madam President, an omission appears to have been made. In the list of tabled motions for a resolution which you have just read out, no mention is made of the compromise motion tabled jointly by the PSE, ELDR, GUE/NGL and Greens/EFA Groups and by Mrs Kuntz and Mr Coûteaux. Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution. If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. (The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid. Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died. On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts. Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez. We had heard about this regrettable incident. Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish. (The Minutes were approved) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000. Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy. Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans. Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least. I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families. Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment. Agenda The next item is the order of business. Following a request to this effect, which I have received from a number of political groups, and following the meeting of the Conference of Presidents which has just been held, I propose that we add to the agenda a one and a half hour debate on a topical and urgent subject of major importance, pursuant to Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure, on the subject of the European Union' s reaction with regard to the talks in Austria on forming a government.	fr
There is no direct transition between INTERREG II and III, the practical consequences of which are uncertainty in terms of planning and gaps in funding. That is a shame because it threatens perfectly sensible projects. When INTERREG is implemented, it will need to be coordinated and synchronised with the other financial instruments concerned. This is particularly important in order to increase the efficiency of the funds deployed. However, problems will arise in particular from the fact that under PHARE, for example, funds are managed on an annual basis and allocation of appropriations is project-related, whereas INTERREG funds are multiannual and are allocated on a measures-related basis. This will cause practical problems in the future, and I hope that despite this it will be possible to implement INTERREG effectively. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Community initiative LEADER proved itself to be an effective instrument to initiate innovative developments and pilot projects both within and outside rural areas. The preservation of this Community initiative in particular, in the form of a new version - LEADER+ - is therefore greatly to be welcomed. The new LEADER+ programme now covers all rural areas in the European Union, which will open up greater possibilities for potential projects. It is important for there to be coordination between LEADER+ and the other support initiatives in the European Union, but coordination with other national support schemes is also just as important. Overlap between support schemes must be avoided and at the same time it must also be possible to exploit any synergistic effects. In this context the aim of stepping up networking between eligible zones under LEADER is very welcome. Agriculture is one of the cornerstones of the rural environment and it must be possible for it to have a part in the LEADER initiative. In the same way, through the LEADER initiative, structural change in agriculture can be supported by creating new jobs in rural areas. Attention must be paid in the LEADER+ programme to all the sectors of the economy in rural areas; only a combined effort will reap an optimal result. LEADER must now move into the implementation phase. The operational programmes need to be approved as quickly as possible by the Commission, which implies practical and efficient administration of applications and completion of the application approval process as quickly as possible. Five months are provided for this. That seems to me to be rather too long. Efforts should be made here to achieve shorter times. Because anyone who develops a project and has it ready will also want to start implementing it as soon as possible. Despite all the delight over the reworking of this Community initiative LEADER+, I do still have one further concern. In its proposal the Commission called for an observatory for the LEADER+ programme without going into detail on how this proposal would be implemented. For me this raises the following questions: who will work there? How will these people be selected? Where, above all, will the required money come from, and where should this observatory be located? I do think, though, that the LEADER+ programme has not got a penny to spare on additional administrative tasks, which in the normal course of events would have to be carried out by the Commission in any case.	it
The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this. I am convinced that this is an error of judgement. A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement. A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries. Paragraph D of the draft resolution requires a more coordinated and more open economic policy at EU level. It is not, however, possible to talk about this without at the same time talking about monetary union. This text says nothing about the major democratic and political problems involving monetary union and the European Central Bank. This is untenable. If there is a desire to make the EU more democratic, the whole construction of EMU must be reconsidered. The Central Bank must be placed under political control so that the direction to be taken by monetary policy may be governed by political objectives such as high employment and prosperity. Public control of the Central Bank must be improved if this is to become possible. The rigid and unsuccessful monetarism of the Stability Pact must be re-examined and discarded so that we might have a uniform policy which has prosperity as its primary objective. Article 56 of the Treaty, prohibiting currency speculation or any interference in the free movement of capital, must be removed so that damaging currency speculation may be checked by means of political control. In the majority of EU countries, there are now governments dominated by social democrats. It is remarkable that, now they have the opportunity to do so, none of them is demanding any change in the direction taken by monetary union. It also, of course, damages credibility when it is stated that monetary union could constitute a counterbalance to globalised capital. The resolution requires the European Parliament to have increased influence over the Intergovernmental Conference. It is, however, important to emphasise that the Intergovernmental Conference is and will remain a conference of the Member States. It is the Member States' parliaments, or people voting in referenda, who are to direct the development of the Treaty. It is therefore out of the question that the European Parliament should be given any formal influence over the negotiation process or over ratification. Mr President, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs has proposed an essentially positive text, which I shall vote for, even if I personally had proposed a lot of amendments to broaden it. Nevertheless, the events of the last few days show that all those who had made basic criticisms of the way enlargement and the revision of the Treaties have been planned were right. The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world.	fr
The two proposals form a coherent whole. The first proposal extends the number of instruments in which an 'undertaking for collective investment in transferable securities' (UCITS) can invest. As already remarked in this session, UCITS are key players within the modern capital markets. Their presence offers the opportunity to a larger number of ordinary investors to participate in these markets, in which the principle of risk-spreading is taken into consideration, protected by appropriate supervision. Since diverse types of investment are permitted, private investors can also benefit from all the advantages of new investment techniques. The second proposal expands the role which these important intermediary organisations can play within the EU capital markets in terms of developing the investment funds sector. By allowing branches to be set up and certain services to be provided on a cross-border basis, these organisations will at long last be able to apply the freedoms of the Treaty of Rome, which they have been denied for all these years. The Commission welcomes many of the clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs with open arms and will adopt a large number of its ideas. The Commission will adopt Amendments Nos - and I am now referring to the most recent numbering - 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 for the first proposal, and 23, 28 and 32 for the second proposal, since these are really very useful clarifications and improvements. I also value the ideas put forward in Amendments Nos 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although the wording needs to be adapted. I also endorse the rationale underlying the general maximum percentage of the counterparty risk in Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45. I can also accept the idea in the second proposed paragraph of Amendment No 47. All the amendments I have listed so far pertain to the first proposal. As far as the second proposal is concerned, the ideas of Amendments Nos 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and some parts of 27, which contain sensible suggestions, can be adopted, again formulated appropriately. The Commission has suggested adopting the content of these, with certain changes in the wording. Moreover, I have taken note of the request made by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs to codify the entire text, once it has been approved - Amendment No 7 of the first proposal and Amendment No 22 of the second proposal.  The Commission is in favour of codification and will, in the foreseeable future, once the proposals have been approved and subject to its right of initiative, concentrate its efforts on drafting a codified version. However, I cannot accept the wording of the consideration as it stands. The Commission is also of the opinion that a number of the amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs would fundamentally change the content of the first proposal. This is why the Commission regrets that it is unable to accept the following amendments to the first proposal: Amendment No 8 because the proposed, general reference to assets 'covered by this directive' , instead of the more precise reference to assets 'mentioned in Article 19 of this Directive' , hinders implementation. This Amendment could also lead to different interpretations in the Member States, which might well look for similar instruments in other articles of the directive.	it
Consequently, we see poverty and exclusion as the greatest enemies of peace and freedom. I concur with what other members of my political group have said and I commend the tone of your document. However, there are two omissions which need to be addressed in our future work. The first concerns women, gender and women's rights. You talked about how women can help in increasing production and growth. That is important, but equality is not only necessary for productivity, but also to make our societies more democratic. It is therefore noticeable that 'equality', 'gender' and 'women' are barely mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'. You mentioned 'women' in your speech, but they are not referred to in the context of the strategic goals. Is that because mainstreaming is already so widespread in the Commission that there is no need to mention women? What other explanation could there be for omitting women? The EU must not take on a masculine persona. My other question concerns Africa, which is the only continent not mentioned in 'Shaping the New Europe'. Africa has the largest number of refugees in the world, the most overall poverty and a debilitating AIDS epidemic. I know that Commissioner Nielson and some of the other Commissioners are doing a fine job, but the rest of the Commission also needs to focus more clearly on that continent, partly by including it among its strategic goals. Finally, I welcome the Commission's statement and the fact that this says for the first time that the EU is prepared unilaterally to introduce measures to make it easier for developing countries to gain access to our markets. I would merely ask when this is likely to take effect. Madam President, President of the Commission, this is a vital document for the future and fate of Europe. However, out of all the points, two specifically require our attention, and they are closely linked: peace and stability within Europe and outside Europe. It is a question of objectives that must be pursued as a priority. For some time, we have all agreed on this notion, but we must also clearly affirm that these objectives will not be achieved without enlargement, even if this comes at a price. Today, we have been called on to choose, for the forthcoming decades, between a Europe that might be less prosperous but a beacon of peace and civilisation for the whole planet and a Europe that might be more wealthy, but where there is uncertainty over what the future might bring. These goals will be more easily obtainable only if the Intergovernmental Conference, which will draw to a close within the year, results in constitutional reform, providing the Commission with real and adequate powers so that it will no longer merely implement Council decisions or Parliament' s codecisions but will have to perform the role of a real European government. The first supporter of this reform should be Parliament itself, if it really wants to increase its role of interpreting the will of the Europeans and acquire the centrality which is part of a genuinely democratic and firmly integrated Union.	es
"In the light of developments in recent days, it might well be asked what we really are to do about these intergovernmental conferences and treaty amendments when government leaders - in reality the European Council of Ministers - make decisions in relation to an independent Member State entailing intervention in that Member State' s democratic process. You can think what you like about Mr Haider, and I personally consider him to be a very dangerous politician, but you cannot just intervene in an independent and friendly country' s democratic process. When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen. I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon. On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000. This is a big task but it can be done. I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement. In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important ""Amsterdam leftovers"" . These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe. In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining. We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission. I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point. At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution. We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty. In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions. So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully. We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents. The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe. Mr President, I warmly recommend a vote in favour of the Dimitrakopoulos/Leinen resolution, which clearly expresses both our disappointment at the inadequacy of the agenda and our wish that the Intergovernmental Conference should take place as soon as possible."	fr

Mr President, before we start the debate on Kosovo or Mitrovica, I must inform you that a nasty sense of unease has come over me. Indeed, it is not the first time that we will be debating Kosovo here. We have adopted resolutions in the past but they usually are nothing but a warning shot, as nothing is actually done with them. I very much appreciate it that the Commission always attends. I certainly appreciate the fact that Commissioner Patten is present, given his powers. But I - and many Members with me - also have to note that the Council is consistently absent from this debate. We need to cooperate with the Council too. I see that a diplomat from the Council is present who is diligently taking notes and who will then report to the Council but, for the rest, nothing will get done. I would insist on changing our procedures and on the fact that the Council should be present during the topical debate, so that we can enter into direct consultation with the Council. I think we should give this some thought. I would request you to pass this complaint on to the Bureau of Parliament. Mr President, Commissioner, we have not signed this compromise motion for a resolution for two reasons. First, because Mr Sakellariou, who is known for his openness and tolerance and whom I shall not quote, vehemently vetoed it in a bid to set himself up as your moral defender.	it
I think it is an important step we are taking, even if each of the national systems is not especially influenced by it. To the rapporteur' s regret, I must unfortunately point out that our Group cannot support Amendment No 3 because we consider that it restricts creditors' legal position and impairs their legal protection. With regard to Amendment No 6, we tabled a similar amendment in the negotiations in committee. I am a little surprised that you in the Group of the Party of European Socialists did not support it then. We shall now support your Amendment No 6, but I wonder why you did not support our own amendment in committee. I also hope that we produce some insight in this context and that we shall be able to compare which procedures are quickest and best in the various countries. . (PT) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, first of all, the Commission wishes to emphasise above all that the draft regulation being debated this evening is merely an amendment of the 1995 Convention on insolvency proceedings. As you all know, this convention was the result of many years of discussion, which was often difficult and often laborious, and that for this very reason, it represents a compromise between unitary and territorial principles, that is to say, the structural principles of the different legal insolvency proceedings in each of our Member States. Because we are aware that the developing global economic situation, and particularly the single market, can force businesses to resort more frequently to insolvency proceedings, which often take the form of cross-border proceedings, the Union itself is fully justified in equipping itself with the binding legal instruments it needs to ensure that insolvency proceedings are carried out according to a set of common structural principles, thus ensuring that they are carried out swiftly. For better or for worse, the fact that businesses become insolvent will become an increasingly common occurrence in our daily economic life. It will furthermore be a factor in renewing the very fabric of business, which must not be hindered by the existence of slow bureaucratic procedures or by obstacles that prolong the agony of businesses that are no longer viable. This is why it is important to try to find a legal frame of reference which can adapt to the new requirements of a global economy. It was not the Commission that presented the present proposal for a regulation but two Member States, Germany and Finland, by means of a joint initiative under the right of initiative which Member States share with the Commission on such issues. The Commission considers that this regulation makes no substantive amendment to the text of the Convention. As far back as 1981, the Commission had already stated its position in favour of clearly adopting the principle of unitary insolvency proceedings. Furthermore, this view was accepted in the Commission' s proposals on a parallel procedure concerning the liquidation of businesses. The 1995 Convention, on the other hand, authorises the filing of secondary proceedings, thereby creating situations which are exceptions to the general rule that the Commission would like to see accepted. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would therefore have preferred that a new text be adopted, one which would specifically enshrine the principle of unitary proceedings.	it
Mr President, Commissioner, there is a risk of Central Asia and the Caspian Sea becoming the Balkans of the 21st Century. That is why it is imperative to stabilise the two major states of Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in particular. That is why I would like to ask you what you are actually able to do within your own sphere of competence, how the negotiations with regard to the partnership agreement with these two countries are going, that is, with regard to political relations that is. Of course, that falls within your remit; my next question falls within Mr Nielson' s remit in that it concerns environmental cooperation, in particular matters pertaining to water and the problems surrounding the cotton monocultures, which are the cause of great aridity. We were able, at the Istanbul Summit a couple of weeks ago, to meet and have discussions with some of the Central Asian republics. I am very anxious that we should strengthen our relationship with them. I can send the honourable Member, if he would like, a detailed breakdown of exactly where we stand on the negotiation of partnership and cooperation agreements with each of the Central Asian republics. Obviously everyone will hope that his prediction of what may happen in the future is on the gloomy side. But I have no doubt at all that he is right to point to the strategic importance of Central Asia. I have heard the honourable Member talk in the past about the Caucasus as well. He is absolutely right to say that a Union which talks about conflict prevention should be looking at what it can do in these particular areas to ensure that there is not the sort of conflict in the future which has caused so much devastation in the Balkans and which has cost us a great deal more than we might have had to spend otherwise, had we taken more pre-emptive measures if those had been possible. So the honourable Member's remarks about the strategic importance of these regions are extremely well made. We are contributing to programmes in the region which have some ecological impact. Our food programmes are directly related to structural reforms in agriculture as well as poverty alleviation. Those programmes themselves are intended to ensure that agriculture has a more soundly based position in those societies and does not consist simply of raping the land. There is an ecological aspect which we should continue to give priority to. We also take good note of the fact that the Member who has asked the question has applauded the Commissioner' s answer. This is not the usual state of affairs. And furthermore the Commissioner has not quoted from his bibliography this time. Thank you very much, Mr Patten, for your interventions today. Question No 35 by (H-0778/99): Subject: Greek action plan for employment According to the findings of the evaluation of Action Plans for Employment, Greece and Italy are the main targets for criticism from the Commission for not properly carrying out employment support measures and policies.	es
In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved. Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport. But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem. I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)]. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the directive on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road, which entered into force on 1 January 1997, contains a number of transitional provisions which are only valid for a limited period of time, the term of validity being linked to the completion of specific standardisation work by the CEN, that is the European Committee for Standardisation. Delays in the CEN' s work are now making it difficult to apply this very directive. In particular, annexes cannot be adapted to take account of technical and industrial developments. I regret this since we are having to take action because others have not done their job. In this respect, I accept this proposal to amend Directive 94/55/EC which has been tabled for discussion today. Should the European Union fail to take action, then Member States would be obliged to amend their national legislation for a very brief period, until the CEN completes its work, which would cause unnecessary cost and uncertainty. The amendment to the directive on today's agenda does not therefore affect the existing harmonisation of the transport of dangerous goods in the Community. It merely prolongs transitional rules by postponing deadlines, deletes provisions which are no longer applicable, and lays down the procedures for a) carrying out the ad hoc transportation of dangerous goods and b) enacting less stringent national regulations, in particular for the transport of very small amounts of dangerous goods within strictly defined local areas. The amendment to the directive is consequently in full accordance with the principle of subsidiarity; the Member States obtain more powers. The Commission decides whether the Member States may impose certain rules of their own. In so doing, it is supported by a committee of experts on the transport of dangerous goods under the regulatory procedure. The procedures for the exercise of these implementing powers conferred on the Commission were laid down afresh in the Council Decision of June 1999.	de
I regret the delay with which LEADER, as was the case with the other three initiatives, was presented to Parliament and for the knock-on delay this entailed for the whole procedure. Finally, I am concerned by the paucity of the amount allocated, if you consider, in addition, that this time the programme is available to all the countries of the Union and will be implemented for a year longer than the previous LEADER II. I would like to thank the Commission services for their helpfulness and cooperation, and I would like to thank my colleagues in the Committee on Agriculture for the contribution they have made through their amendments. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, my report on EQUAL takes the form of an opinion delivered as part of the process of consultation on a new Community initiative, whose objective is to promote transnational cooperation and through it new methods of combating all forms of discrimination and inequalities in connection with the labour market. The report was a major undertaking because it also incorporates opinions from four further committees - from the Committee on Industry, External Trade, Research and Energy, the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, the Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, and the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs. This Community initiative succeeds the two forerunner programmes ADAPT and EMPLOYMENT and has a much smaller budget of around EUR 2.8 billion. The initiative adopts a completely new approach, which is to develop innovative employment models within transnational geographical or sectoral development partnerships. The intention is clear: targeted projects are to be developed at transnational level, projects which are based on the employment policy guidelines of employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities. This objective is very much to be welcomed and also meets with a broad consensus in this House. In addition, EQUAL should feed into the National Action Plans for employment and its implementation should be able to be monitored through these Action Plans. It is an important Community initiative which, together with the three other initiatives, URBAN, LEADER and INTERREG, is financed out of the Structural Funds. In my report I have tried to reduce excessive administrative expenditure and to build greater openness and flexibility into the system of development partnerships. I consider technical support to be necessary but, given the problems with the former TAOs, no new TAOs should be set up without Parliament' s approval so as to prevent political responsibility from being passed down to the technical assistance level. Nevertheless, technical assistance is necessary. Particular attention is also paid to the dissemination of results and learning from each other by identifying best practice, with special emphasis on mainstreaming. I have endeavoured to secure the widest possible support for the report. This has meant a reduction in the number of amendments - from over 100 in committee to 22 for the plenary - which has also created numerous opportunities for compromises. A compromise has now also been reached on the issue of asylum seekers. However, in this context, Madam President, to allow us to work out the details, I should like to request that the vote on the EQUAL report be held not tomorrow but on Wednesday.	it
Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle. It is about brominated flame retardants. It is a fact that these substances are now being discovered. There are increased concentrations of them in both people and the environment. There are many people who maintain that they entail major risks, while others question how large the risks involved in these substances really are. Recently, both Sweden and Denmark urged the Commission in the Council of Ministers to take the initiative and ban brominated flame retardants. I am wondering, therefore, if you are preparing such a ban and if it would not fit in very well with your approach to the precautionary principle itself to come up with such an initiative. . (SV) Mr President, thank you very much, Mr Sjöstedt, for this question. The issue of brominated flame retardants is an important one. It was raised quite recently in the Environment Council by a number of ministers who want the Commission to look at what basis there might be for a ban and at what might need to be done. We are in the process of looking into this question and assessing what knowledge we have today and what it is possible to do. Allow me to remind you, however, that use of the precautionary principle does not need to be synonymous with there being a total ban. There may be a series of different measures which can be taken. It ought not, therefore, to be immediately interpreted as a ban. Where brominated flame retardants are concerned, there may eventually be a ban, but it is important to say that the precautionary principle permits the whole spectrum of political measures and initiatives to be taken. This issue is extremely topical. The Commission is to do its job and give proper attention to the issue before we come back with an assessment of what needs to be done. You said that the precautionary principle should not be used as a disguised trade barrier. Is the understanding of this point the same on both sides of the Atlantic Ocean? I think we are going to have problems particularly with hormone-treated beef and genetically modified crops. Will the Americans take the same view of this point as we do? . (SV) Mr President, I am pleased to be able to tell you that, in Montreal, we have just signed a protocol concerning bio-safety. We succeeded there in agreeing, at an international forum, as to the definition of the precautionary principle. I consider it to be a breakthrough that we succeeded in concluding this protocol. I believe it will set the trend for future discussions concerning the precautionary principle. We are going to be able to use this as an example of how the precautionary principle is to be interpreted. It is, moreover, also accepted as an important and effective tool. Mr President, I have two questions. I shall try to be very brief indeed. The first question concerns the implementation of the precautionary principle. As I have understood it, there has been a certain lack of clarity in some respects as to how this is to be understood. Is it the case that a risk assessment is firstly to be carried out, including a cost-benefit analysis? In that case, I am rather concerned, because the idea was really that a cost-benefit analysis should not be used as a tool for deciding whether the precautionary principle should be introduced. Instead, the precautionary principle should come first.	it
In the same way, it is vital for Member States to fulfil their obligation to report to the Commission on the aid granted to their steel undertakings, as stipulated under Article 7 of the Steel Aid Code. The Commission suggests that Member States submit their reports within a time limit of two months following the end of each six-month period or, at least, annually, without the need for reminders. Like the rapporteur, I am pleased with the Commission report, but I did deplore the fact that the report did not cover every aspect of the aid. Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has, on a number of occasions, authorised aid for the steel industry even though such aid did not fall within the categories set out in the code. In the interests of equality, there are grounds to either apply the Steel Aid Code strictly or modify the Code if the Commission wishes to authorise types of aid other than those legally acceptable at the moment. Finally, we have the problem of the consequences of the expiry of the ECSC Treaty. The aid system must effectively be continued beyond 2002. My feeling in this respect is that only a Council Regulation can provide the necessary legal certainty and ensure an official ban on any aid not covered by the code. For all these reasons I voted in favour of the Langen report, and I now await the Commission' s response to our requests and demands. (The sitting was suspended at 1.05 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) Oil slick off the French coast The next item is the Commission statement on the oil slick off the French coast. Mrs de Palacio will open the debate on behalf of the Commission. Mr President, I shall be speaking on behalf of the PPE-DE Group, but also as an elected representative for Brittany, and I am therefore directly concerned and shocked by these events. Together with Mrs Grossetête and the PPE-DE Group, we tabled a motion for a resolution. I am pleased to see that we have today arrived at a compromise motion. The Erika shipwreck is a truly European issue, firstly because it is disfiguring and polluting some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, with extremely serious consequences for tourism, people who earn their living from the sea and environmentalists, and also because the underlying issue is the regulation and monitoring which ought naturally to be on a European scale. A disaster of this scale could almost certainly not have occurred along the American coastline, and why? Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard. If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred. This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability.	it
There is, of course, the question of pre-accession aid, and this belongs in category seven. Last year, Parliament made an exception by agreeing that this expenditure should be placed in category four, and the two applicant States are not therefore being treated on an equal footing with the applicant States from Central and Eastern Europe, as they, in fact, should be, according to the declarations from the Helsinki Summit. Resources should therefore be set aside from category seven, where a review of the financial perspectives must be carried out. This is the crux of the matter. The main point is that the money for Cyprus' s and Malta' s pre-accession aid should come from category seven and that there should be a review of the financial perspectives for, if the Council does not endorse this view, it is in reality acting in conflict with its own decisions in Helsinki in December. With regard to the amount which is quoted in the Brok report (EUR 130 million), I also want to say, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, that we must negotiate our way towards finding a sum of money. The most important thing is that a multi-annual programme be guaranteed, and in the correct category, so that it might be possible to begin making plans where Cyprus and Malta are concerned. Mr President, the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance support the decision adopted by the European Council in Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot be a prior condition for the accession of Cyprus to the European Union. We should continue to exert strong pressure on the Government of Cyprus, but one section of the population cannot blackmail the wish of the majority. Besides, we have strong doubts as to how representative the government is of that part of the island is. It is clear that the window of opportunity mentioned by the presidency should be exploited to the full. But we are also convinced that, despite improved relations between the Turkish and Greek populations, it is not enough. The conflict in Cyprus will only be resolved through improved relations between the two communities with a view to establishing a federation in the - we hope - not too distant future. In particular, we should be working towards establishing genuine freedom of movement and resolving the problems of demilitarising and disarming the island. The European Union should be taking a more decisive role that goes further than merely providing financial support, although that is important, by promoting and guaranteeing reconciliation between the two communities through the setting up of fora and confidence-building programmes. I must say that Alex Langer's presence here in the European Parliament is sadly missed. His efforts to build peace should serve as an example, to all of us, on how peaceful coexistence can be achieved. Mr President, the reference to dialogue between the two Cypriot communities under the aegis of the UNO reminds us of the fact that, 26 years after the invasion of the island by the Turkish army, nearly 40% of the territory is still occupied by 35 000 soldiers, heavy weaponry is still being used and over 50 000 colonists are still present, in total violation of the resolutions by the Security Council of the United Nations on this matter.	it
This service must therefore be kept public. This is the only way to guarantee that the network, from collection to distribution, will be a comprehensive network which cannot be broken up or used only in part and according to the convenience of postal service operators. However, further to the directive on common rules for Community postal services, the Commission has undertaken studies which have not been forwarded to the European Parliament. We are therefore unaware of the impacts of the directive' s application on either the level of service provided to the people or the current European postal operators in terms of both economics and employment. In our opinion, the whole process of applying this directive must therefore be halted, including its timetable. Any change to the current situation must be preceded by a rigorous study of its various implications, with the objective always being to guarantee a high-quality public service and to retain the current public operators and existing jobs. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I want to support this proposal on principle while asking right at the outset whether the previous speaker' s statement that on the one hand we need an innovative and highly effective and competitive service while on the other hand this service should be a public service, is not a contradiction in terms. I think ours is a different approach! European policy has liberalised monopoly markets - energy, telecommunications and air transport - and the target, the focus, was always the consumer. The aim was simply to offer a better service and also to put the emphasis on the user in liberalising the postal services. I think the consumer can decide for himself and define in advance what he needs. He does not need a government to do so, or a parliament, nor does he need a Commission to do so! The postal market is limping along behind and, sadly, we have wasted valuable time here. I believe we should give the postal service a chance to adapt to new trends. I am thinking here of the very sound words of Mr Rübig, who also talked about e-commerce. That will develop very quickly and present the various undertakings in our society with new challenges; we will have to adapt very flexibly and rapidly to these challenges. I believe a liberalised market will speed up this process more than a less liberalised market. It also offers some prospect of conveying a positive picture of European policy. We should seize that opportunity, for the citizen keeps asking, why do we have Europe? These are areas where the citizen can see and understand the benefit of Europe. I am glad Mr Monti, the Commissioner for competition, is here today in person, for he is pursuing an excellent policy. And here I want to turn to an area where in my view - and this is a point also made in this debate - Parliament and the Commission must consider where to draw limits to competition. We are in favour of competition as a component of the social market economy, and of course we are also in favour of it because we want this economic system to be as successful as possible.	fr
I am thinking in particular of the pre-accession structural instrument, which I shall be responsible for implementing in the next few weeks. You see, ladies and gentlemen, we have only just initiated the new programming and we are already considering together the impact of the Union' s enlargement on our structural policy. This sixth periodic report which you assessed as positive on the whole, Mr Berend, is a good basis for our thinking, for us all and for myself. I should therefore like to thank you most sincerely for your contribution to the thinking which we are already engaged in with regard to the forthcoming guidelines, as well as for the proper application of the guidelines for the period 2000-2006. Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? Mr President, I respond to an invitation yesterday afternoon by the President of the House to speak on behalf of my group on a matter referred to in the Minutes. I refer to item 11 on the order of business. Firstly, I believe the issue raised by the President of the Socialist Group yesterday about the reinstatement of the debate with the President of the Commission on the five-year strategic programme was sufficiently important for other speakers who wished to comment briefly on that matter to have been accommodated. I wish to express that view even if I respectfully disagreed and voted against the proposal of the President of the Socialist Group. The second point I would like to make - and which I would have wished to make yesterday before the vote - is that this Parliament, as other speakers remarked yesterday, can only really have an effect if it works in close cooperation and synergy with the European Commission. We should also have the humility to recognise that, if we wanted to have a strategic debate accompanied not just by a presentation and elucidation by the President of the Commission, but also by a five-year programme, we should have the mechanisms in place more than just a week in advance of the debate in this House, so as to be able to discuss and convey in due time to the Commission what our wishes were. There is one basic lesson I would like us to learn from this. When there are major set-piece debates scheduled between this House and the European Commission in the future, we should clear all of our lines on what are our mutual expectations at least one full working month in advance. There needs firstly to be clarity between all of the groups of this House and then between this House and the Commission. We should not find ourselves late in the day in the unfortunate position where the one or other institution creates an unnecessary fracture in institutional relationships. Looking at some of the press reports of last Friday, I believe that the Commission and its President exercised commendable self-restraint in the way they commented publicly. That is something for which I have a deep appreciation. I hope that we will learn the lessons and not repeat this unnecessary exercise which I believe was founded on a misapprehension as to what was expected rather than any bad faith on the part of either of the two institutions.	it
Unfortunately, and as everyone recognised during the military action in Kosovo, there were civilian sectors, and in particular infrastructural sectors directly affecting the general public, and even inhabited areas, which were directly affected by NATO air attacks. This is generally recognised and this happens in all wars, and the Kosovo war was not a clean war, nor a model war, but a war based on the art of the possible. And, above all, it was a necessary war, and it was not only about what was possible, it was necessary to put an end to an absolutely unacceptable form of aggression which was utterly rejected by the entire international community. Mr Marset Campos, regardless of how we may see things with hindsight - and it is easy to see things with the benefit of hindsight, if you take no action yourself - I believe that, if we look at what happened in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and at the impunity that the situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina led to, and the continuation of that impunity, then we might perhaps see the NATO military action in Kosovo in a somewhat less catastrophic light. Question No 4 by (H-0028/00): Subject: Turkish blockade of Armenia Given that the European Union is actively promoting social, economic and political relations with Armenia through the Partnership and Cooperation Agreement, signed on 12 October 1999, what steps is the Council taking to persuade the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Has the time come for the Turkish Government to lift the economic blockade of Armenia? Mr President, I would like to thank the Representative of the Council Presidency for his answer. Nevertheless, I am a little disappointed that this is viewed from a bilateral angle first and foremost when, ultimately, there is in fact a major tripartite relationship. We provide partnership funding and there are cooperation agreements in place, in order to help Armenia, and still the aid cannot come into play because Turkey has imposed an economic blockade, and so many things cannot get through to the Armenians at all. We are negotiating with Turkey as to the possibility of its acceding to the Union and so it is in the interests of all of us that every state that wishes to become a Member should cultivate friendly relations with its neighbours. Can you not exert greater influence over Turkey, so as to enable there to be peaceful developments in this region, and so as to enable Armenians themselves to develop in the way they need to for there to be progress on the cooperation front? - (PT) Mrs Schleicher, you are quite right to say that we should use our relationship with Turkey to ensure that that country can play a constructive role in this situation and, particularly, that it becomes part of the solution rather than part of the problem. We feel that precisely because Turkey has embarked on a new type of relationship with the European Union, and also because Turkey now has to respond to the European Union' s positions on common foreign and security policy issues, we will, to be frank, be testing Turkey' s will as regards the European Union' s priorities in its foreign relations.	fr
Of course we have pondered this issue, and we are still studying it extremely carefully, and this is also thanks to the concerns you have voiced. At the end of the day, I honestly do not believe that this fear is justified. The Commission proposal accords the Commission a central role in establishing guidelines on competition policy. The reform does not entail any reduction in the Commission' s activities, but requires them to focus on the most important dossiers. The reform will lead to a gradual development - I stress this because I was particularly taken with this term, used by Mrs Randzio-Plath, and, moreover, I fully agree with it - of European competition culture. So, the reform will lead to the various national competition cultures being transplanted and taking root in the European competition culture - where today various small plants thrive, and they are certainly not all the same. The fifteen sets of national provisions will gradually be abandoned, permitting greater use of Community law, which a higher number of protagonists will be able to apply. Allow me to emphasise that this is communitisation, not renationalisation, of competition law. The question of consistent application: the risk of inconsistent application of competition rules must be borne in mind, but I do not believe that it should be exaggerated. As with many other provisions of the Treaty, Articles 81(1) and 82 have, after all, been applied for decades by national authorities and judges, and I do not feel that this has created serious problems. In a directly applicable exception system, consistency will depend firstly on the degree of clarity of the material rules. The Commission will make every effort to define the legislative framework, both through general provisions and through its decision-making practice. Secondly, we will need to set efficient mechanisms in place to prevent disputes, and the White Paper sets out mechanisms for information and consultation. In this respect, I would like to say something about the excellent idea put forward by Mrs Riis-Jørgensen and Mr Huhne of monitoring implementation. This then is the idea of monitoring implementation. I must say that I find this a very good idea that we will probably take up. Though we have a high respect for the work of national competition authorities and so on, it is evident that we will watch very carefully how EC law is applied by national authorities and courts. That is why the Commission wants to keep the right to withdraw a case from a national competition authority in the event of incorrect application. This goes at least some way towards alleviating your concerns, Mrs Peijs. Concerning Mr Evans' point regarding the implications for businesses, it is important that the cost-benefit analysis should be seriously conducted. The purpose of publishing the White Paper is, after all, to collect comments from businesses as well as from other sources. We have received many excellent observations and contributions which give us the material to make a cost-benefit assessment for business. We will examine all that material carefully before making a legislative proposal for a new regulation.	fr
"I am sure that your answer to this will be ""yes"" but I would be grateful if you could tell me if these gentlemen are also aware as to what the consequences of this will be? My next question, Mrs Wallström, is when will you begin to apply this principle to legislation; to legislation pertaining to chemicals or other sectors, for example? Lastly, will we be able to recognise when this principle has been applied in legislation? In other words, will each proposal contain an additional sheet stating that checks have been made as to the application of the precautionary principle and the following conclusion has been reached? . Thank you very much, Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, for these questions. Of course, this is shared by the whole Commission. This is a common communication which was written by the three of us, David Byrne, Erkki Liikanen and myself, but it has been passed unanimously in the Commission today. It received strong support from the rest of the Commissioners and it has been through an interservice consultation in the whole of the Commission. So we have really worked through this document and I am sure that they are all able to describe the guidelines and the principles as laid down in this document. Yes, I would say we already use this way of working with different, difficult issues like a new chemical strategy for example. And, I am sure that we will also mention it explicitly when we work with this principle. We have just recently had a case of using the precautionary principle when it came to ban phthalates in soft PVC toys; and of course, we apply it in several different environmental areas. It has been mainly used in the environmental field, but, of course also when it comes to human health. So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it. Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence. Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power. We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for? The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists. I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority? How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority? If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way? These are my three questions. . Yes, Mr President, that is true. There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management."	de
I would like to ask the President-in-Office of the Council, after his few hours working in this Chamber with these Members of the European Parliament, whether he has come to any assessment of what they are worth in terms of pay? Mr Purvis, as this discussion of salaries in the European Parliament does not relate exclusively to your country and even affects my country, I have a precise idea of what the salaries of the Members of the European Parliament are worth. I am therefore perfectly aware of this problem. Mr President, I want to thank you for your answer. I want to ask a follow-up question which bears some resemblance to the one Mr Sjöstedt asked. We both come from Sweden. In our country, we pay our tax in the form of local taxes because the services concerned are local. We have extensive services, too. We have problems stemming from the lack of confidence in politicians and, not least, in European politicians here in Parliament. How do you think that public confidence in ourselves as politicians would be affected if a situation were to arise in which we obtained the right to use services where we live - education, health care etc - but, at the same time, did not pay any tax and did not contribute? How do you think a system like that would affect people' s confidence in ourselves as politicians? Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I do not know whether you are obliged to answer this question since it is really a philosophical question. However, if you wish to enter into the realms of philosophy, go ahead! . Mr President, I have no desire to enter into the realms of philosophy. These are fundamental issues which concern the very shape of the Statute for Members and of its role in the context of political society. I do not want to enter into this type of discussion because I think that it might, to use a French expression, préjuger the Portuguese Presidency' s views in the course of the negotiations in which it is involved on the Statute for Members. I would ask you to allow me to refrain from commenting on this matter. Since the time allotted to Questions to the Council has elapsed, Questions Nos 11 to 35 will be replied to in writing.  That concludes Questions to the Council. (The sitting was suspended at 7.05 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) Address by Mr Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic Mr President in office, ladies and gentlemen, I have great honour in extending a warm welcome, on behalf of the House, to the President of the Czech Republic, Mr Vaclav Havel. I should also like to welcome Mrs Havel, who is sitting in the gallery. You are most welcome. (Applause) This is not your first visit to our Parliament, Mr President. You addressed plenary in Strasbourg nearly six years ago, in March 1994, and many of us, who were already European Members of Parliament at that time, still have a vivid recollection of your speech. In fact, shortly after the Maastricht Treaty was ratified, you spoke in favour of strengthening European values, creating a European ethical dimension and opening the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe. In other words, for many citizens, and not just in your country, you personify the European values to which we constantly voice our attachment.	it
"The Commission confirmed then, as it does today, that it shares the concerns underlying the Portuguese Presidency' s statement of 1 February 2000. These concerns are legitimate and there are good reasons for them. There is no need for me to remind you of Jörg Haider' s political bias and of his many xenophobic and racist public statements, which are also anti-European. The fact that an openly extremist, racist and xenophobic party can reach power in a Member State of the European Union will inevitably be a source of concern to the other States that are taking part in the European project. The European Commission is certainly not indifferent to the matter either. Secondly, the Commission reiterated and reiterates again its commitment to continue fulfilling its duty as guardian of the Treaties, specifically with regard to Articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on European Union. One of the most important innovations provided by the Treaty of Amsterdam was to clarify the basic principles which represent the shared heritage of the Member States. Another innovation was the establishment of a mechanism which would monitor whether these principles are being fulfilled, and which would react if any of them were violated. The Commission thereby gave a practical demonstration of its commitment to one of the essential pillars: that of the rule of law. This principle means that the Commission must act within the limits laid down by the Treaties and it is in this context that the statement of 1 February was made. The Commission is not a State. It cannot and must not act as if it were one. In order to give a precise answer to your question, Mr Ford, I must remind you that in order for the mechanism established by Article 7.1 of the Treaty on European Union to be applied, there must be proof of the existence and I quote, of a ""serious and persistent breach by a Member State of the principles mentioned in Article 6."" I repeat, a ""serious and persistent breach"" is the condition necessary for the Commission to be able to propose to the Council that measures be adopted against a Member State. I think that it is obvious that conditions have not been met which would apply to the current situation in Austria. As a matter of fact I think that I am right in saying that we all hope that these conditions of a serious and persistent breach of human rights and of democracy are never fulfilled, either in Austria or in any other Member State. I would like to assure you of my personal commitment and of that of the Commission, as stated once again by President Prodi this morning, to doing everything to ensure that we do not have to apply the mechanism stated in Article 7. I would also like to assure you though that we will not hesitate to apply it should it prove necessary. The values at stake are too central, too fundamental for us to accept dithering or compromises. Individuals and governments should be judged by what they do rather than by what they say. In Austria' s case, the statements are contradictory to say the least. On the one hand, any of us could pick up on a whole cluster of inflammatory remarks by the leader of the Freedom Party. On the other hand, the new Austrian Government' s programme reaffirms its commitment to defend democracy and human rights."	es
In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal. In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister. This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm. In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid. The pattern of intimidation is clear. There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree. All this is happening on a daily basis. Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal. It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased. The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia. Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected. Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria. This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice. At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat. The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow. . Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday. I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge. First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails. Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation. In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society. Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities.	fr
B5-0173/2000 by Mr Papayannakis and Mr Sjöstedt on behalf of the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left, B5-0179/2000 by Mrs Schroedter and others on behalf of the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance on the environmental disaster caused by cyanide leaking from a Romanian goldmine into the Lepos, Somes, Tisza and Danube Rivers. Mr President, we debated the framework directive on water this week, and the disaster in Romania has demonstrated once again how very seriously we need to take the protection of water. This disaster has raised a number of important issues which concern us as a European Union. We are delighted with the pledge that EU aid will be used to clean the rivers, and at least as important is the reinforcement of environmental awareness both in Romania and, more generally, in Central and Eastern Europe. We therefore welcome Commissioner Wallström' s brief visit, for it can contribute to this awareness. After all, this is a candidate country we are talking about, and this disaster is in addition to the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will comply with the EU environmental rules in time. The polluter ought to pay. I wonder whether the European Union can recoup this kind of cost from the environmental cowboys who appear in the so-called 'Wild East' , making use of the inadequate environmental legislation in place. I would be in favour of its doing so. Mr President, Commissioner, there has been one ecological disaster after another and, unfortunately, they are all similar. Once again, there is cause for concern at the serious pollution affecting the fourth most important wetland in Europe. The delta of the Danube is in danger. As in Spain in April 1998, as in Brittany and the Vendée since last December, once again an exceptional natural site is under serious threat. The European Parliament is constantly drawing attention in its resolutions to this sort of danger, which threatens our environment, upsets our ecosystem and again weakens our populations. This new disaster raises the problem of the integration of the environmental acquis communautaire in candidate countries. The authorities in these counties, which are still very frail from an environmental point of view, need to overcome numerous obstacles. First, they need to be able to prevent this type of discharge more efficiently by equipping the most critical industrial sites; then they need to have suitable technical means of curbing and containing this type of pollution and, finally, they need to be able to implement programmes to restore the most affected and the most sensitive sites. Today, the banks and the waters of more than four rivers crossing four countries are polluted, which is why the European Union needs to concentrate its efforts and pressure on the urgent need for all candidate countries to come into line with Community environmental protection standards. But, over and above that, it is the technologies and the means used to prevent and deal quickly and efficiently with this type of disaster which are being called into question.	fr
Finally, in relation to the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the citizens of Europe need to have a vision of citizenship. The Euro, employment, even security, are not enough. They need a 'European soul' , as a distinguished Spanish professor once said. Mr President, unlike some of the previous speakers, I want to go back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and Mr Vitorino. This trio's words were like music to our ears as Mr Ceyhun has said. As with all music it needs to be a fine tune and properly orchestrated. Many of us of here are very optimistic about the next six months. The tune that will be played will be one that the people of Europe will be listening to and they will want to hear the right sort of tune. As described this afternoon it will go a long way towards drowning out some of the unpleasant tunes we heard during the European election and over the last few months. The Amsterdam Treaty and the Tampere Council built on this project for an area of freedom, security and justice in the European Union. One area though is extremely important, and this House must be involved in it: namely scrutiny. There is so much legislation - and I very much welcome the Portuguese programme that was outlined to us last week - but we need to be absolutely sure that it is scrutinised, that the people in this Parliament and the members of the national parliaments and the citizens of Europe are aware of everything involved in it. And we must make certain that the details are applicable, appropriate and relevant to the different countries. I should like to draw attention to some of the aspects of the resolutions before us this afternoon, one or two of which were referred to earlier on. I welcome the movement towards the recognition of judicial systems in the various countries and the cooperation on crime. That is an area that European citizens will respond to and will be happy about. But the Commission and Council must know that there are many people in this House who have reservations about the Eurodac system, for example. We accept the predominant role of the Council in this, but there are reservations and I am sure that the Council will listen to the words coming from the elected parliamentarians here when they go through it in more detail. Mr Schulz said earlier on that he was not certain about the definition of 'scoreboard' . Anyone who is English or British or follows cricket knows what a scoreboard is. A scoreboard tells people the score; it has to be up-to-date and it has to be clear and visible. I am sure that Commissioner Vitorino will make certain that is so. At the end of six months I hope that the music is still playing and that the European people are still listening. Mr President, I would like to welcome the President-in-Office and his colleague from the Justice Ministry, Mr Costa, and to thank them for the welcome they gave my committee in Lisbon last week and the constructive meetings we enjoyed. Amsterdam and Tampere have given us much work to do together, as the excellent draft resolution by Mrs Terrón today shows.	it
"For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States. For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level. There are, therefore, two points to which I would like to draw the Commission' s attention. Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds. This is something about which European small and medium-sized businesses, in particular, tend to complain. I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern. Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular. But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them. The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability. That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide. I would like to explain our thinking here. Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as ""value for money"" indicators in the grant-giving process. Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period. But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful. Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad."	it
These inspections may be carried out by the roadside, in ports and in other places where vehicles park, or, as is more frequent in the case of public service vehicles, on the operator's premises. In fact, several States already apply this type of inspection, the so-called 'roadside inspections' , in the manner laid down in the directive, that is, in a somewhat unexpected manner. This may in fact be the best way to effectively monitor the state of the vehicles in circulation on our roads. I would like to say that the Commission is aware that Parliament is concerned that this proposal might lead to discrimination against certain transport contractors, or lorries from certain countries or even certain makes of vehicle, and that the intention of the principal recommendation of the rapporteur is for the fines imposed on operators by the Member States to be harmonised as a condition of application of the directive. We share this concern, but we consider that Amendment No 2 is too drastic and, in this respect, we would support Amendment No 3 which encompasses the spirit we are all aiming for, and which, at the same time, offers the necessary flexibility. We also accept Amendment No 1, and I would like to refer to what Mr Bouwman said. In fact, we are tremendously concerned by the fact that vehicles are being driven in the Union by drivers from third countries, and in particular from candidate countries, who do not have work contracts that conform to Community standards, or the standards of any Community country, but simply obey the standards of these third countries, which are often candidates for accession, or sometimes do not even conform to these standards as the corresponding inspections are not carried out by the said third countries. I have therefore written to all the Ministers for Transport of the fifteen countries of the Union to instigate a discussion on the subject, and also to ask for a report on what the situation is in their countries regarding this type of case, and what positive suggestions they can submit so that we can find a solution to this problem, which concerns us greatly, and which could have negative consequences for road safety, which has to be our main concern, and for fair competition, which is also important to us at the Commission. To this end, I hope that we can deal with these matters at the next Transport Council at the end of this month, as well as, as Mr Watts has said, all aspects of road safety in general since the Portuguese Presidency proposes this as one of the key matters of its Presidency. On the basis that great progress has been made in the past few years, I believe that a great deal still remains to be done, as the death of 42 000 - 43 000 European citizens on the roads is too high a figure and there is still an effort to be made. But I would like to say that, with regard to the problem of drivers from third countries, I hope that before the end of the month we shall have a response, and we shall, in any case, handle this within the Council. And, in response to some questions or initiatives, I shall be able to reply here in Parliament, either during the plenary session or in committee, and, if not, I hope in any case that we shall shortly be able to make a concrete proposal that enables us, truly and effectively, to combat this type of abuse.	de
That does not prevent these Member States from taking public-order measures within the framework of the proposed duty of notification. Neither does the Commission accept the proposal that legal status in a Member State should be valid three months after the card has expired. Following completion of the service, it is not acceptable for the third-country subject in question to remain any longer in the Member State in which the service is provided. That is why the Commission supports Mrs Palacio' s Amendment No 22 in both respects. As far as the second proposal is concerned, the Commission appreciates the wish that it should be clear what is meant by someone who is self-employed and would therefore like to resolve this issue in the amended proposal. These are a few introductory remarks concerning the key amendments. I hope that, at the end of the debate, when all the speakers have contributed, I will once again be given the opportunity to elaborate upon the different amendments. Mr President, tomorrow will see a large majority within the PPE Group vote in favour of the amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, as well as the amended version. I propose to confine my comments to two areas. Firstly there is the question as to what this directive is actually designed to achieve, that is achieve in the real sense. There is the fact that we have to take the interests of the economy and also of the individual into account. My comments start from the premise that we are talking about an upright individual in gainful employment. Then there are the interests of the Member States, which, being on the receiving end, may have to start from the premise of a worst case scenario. If we are going to abide by the one extreme, that is the interests of the Member States, then we certainly have every reason to make the hurdles that have to be cleared in applying for this card relatively high. There is also an argument for introducing early notification obligations as well as having this card. If I were to go to the other extreme, as few hurdles as possible that is, then I would run the risk of failing to produce any legislation whatsoever in the course of this procedure because the Member States would not sign up to this directive. I would therefore end up with a situation where a directive on the service provision card might well be in place, but with the hurdles facing the business world being so high, in reality no one would apply for the card. Alternatively, I might have no directive at all. Neither outcome would be satisfactory. Perhaps this is also why, as is rumoured to be the case, the Council has become bogged down in its negotiations on this as well. We have been trying to reach a happy compromise between one interest - that of public order - and the other, that of finding the easiest possible solution. We want to arrive at a solution where certain hurdles are created vis-à-vis the business world, but once these have been overcome, implementation is as easy as it possibly could be.	es
Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country. Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected. Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union. Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria. My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy. Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly. The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image. This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office. This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy. When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support. We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here! When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day. The FPÖ party is established in Austria' s political landscape. The head of the government of one of the nine provinces belongs to this party and it is involved in all the other provincial governments. What many Austrians are wondering today is why their democratic decision has suddenly been interpreted as an expression of a fascistic cast of mind, and why the campaign did not begin until the Freedom Party rejected the support of a minority government comprising the SPÖ? There is prejudice at work here, which - without going into our programme - is reducing the darkest hour of European history to a political spectacle. I am filled with disgust when certain of our opponents get mileage out of the millions of deaths that took place in the gas chambers of the concentration camps as cheap propaganda, as, for example, the Italian MEP Bertinotti did yesterday on Italian TV when he accused Mr Haider of denying the holocaust. Shame on you Mr Bertinotti! You might have run out of political arguments but that does not give you the right to use those who were murdered as cheap propaganda. Denouncing a democratically elected politician as a Nazi does not make you an anti-fascist! On the contrary, you are deriding the true victims of National Socialism and playing down what the fascist dictators did. Your behaviour stems from your own prejudices, you are dispensing with any form of political debate and you are displaying precisely the kind of behaviour you claim to oppose. The attacks against Austria' s new government and the attempts to exert political influence in a Member State are an insult to the Austrian people.	de
We cannot afford to waste time. It is important that the timetable is an ambitious one. In my opinion, the timetable is not too ambitious if we believe that by 2020 we will no longer allow impurities in water and we aim at zero level quantities of impurities and toxic matter by then. It is a question of doing what is technically possible; obviously it is not possible to do anymore, but we must be sufficiently ambitious. I would like to comment on one issue, which was spoken about earlier. I believe the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy has restricted too tightly the debate on the transfer of water. This is not merely a problem for Spain; it is one for the Nordic countries, and I sincerely hope that we can rely on national solutions in these matters, when they are better for the environment and the economy than what is proposed in the directive. Mr President, Madam Commissioner, congratulations, Mrs Lienemann on an excellent piece of work. Water and air surround us everywhere. We share them with everyone on this earth. Water is a prerequisite for human life. And there are more and more of us in the world. Mrs Schleicher intimated earlier today that clean water was an unrealistic goal. Nothing could be further from the truth! It is unrealistic to go on causing the quality of our water to deteriorate and so, too, the conditions for life. It is especially unrealistic in regard to agriculture which is most dependent upon a clean natural environment and unpolluted resources. I would therefore appeal to Members of Parliament to appreciate that tough demands for a clean environment are a sign of long-term realism of the highest order. Mr President, we - myself included - support the report by Mrs Lienemann, the targets it sets and the directive under discussion. However, we should look a little more closely at some points. For example, a major problem in my country is the diversion of rivers and the consumption of water from lakes, which people try to justify by pseudo-developmental arguments, and which, of course, are a great risk to ground waters, water tables and surface waters. I therefore think that regardless of whether we finally conclude who should decide whether such diversions take place, the specifications common to us all must be very stringent. But the key issue is, in my opinion, planning how to restore water tables, the natural flow of rivers and the natural content of lakes, which must be carried out within the ten year period we have in mind. I think such projects ought to be eligible for funding, because, at the end of the day, that restoration may well prove to be a first-rate development policy. Mr President, here we have what is basically a good measure. It sets out achievable standards based on subsidiarity principles and the water basin management. Its aim of good-quality water for drinking, for wildlife, the environment and economic purposes is right. The prevention of pollution and water deterioration has to be right as well as the ability to manage water in times of drought and flood.	de
"They have been put into the hands of a single Commissioner, Mr Antonio Vitorino, and we congratulate them on this as well. Furthermore, they have taken on the task of creating a ""scoreboard"" to verify the progress made in this area at Community level, but also - and this seems to me to be important - at the level of the Member States. We are pleased about this and we congratulate the Council on these decisions, despite the fact that, for this House, the Treaty of Amsterdam included one disappointment: that of delaying, for five years, our role, our ability to participate actively, to democratically control this area of freedom, security and justice, as well as the role taken in it by the Court of Justice. However, if, on verifying the progress made during 1999, which is within the competence of this Parliament in accordance with the Treaty, we leave behind the stage of great declarations and look at the decisions actually taken and carried out, the scene looks considerably darker, Mr President. It is as if the Council had more than one face and two hands and what one signs up to, the other begrudges. Despite all the commitments made at the highest level, the Council did not manage to take the decisions which it had envisaged. Programmes multiply and overlap and there is no way of ascertaining levels of implementation and effectiveness or, at least, this Parliament is unable to do so. We have presented the Council with a series of questions and I know that it is the will of the Portuguese Presidency to answer each and every one of them. We hope that this presidency will mark the beginning of a change of attitude on the part of the Council towards this Parliament. I said that there was no consistency between the decisions taken by the Council and the policies actually carried out. There are doubts in my Group and doubts also persist in this House, for example, about something which should be good news: the incorporation of the Schengen Agreement into the Community framework. Schengen has been incorporated, as we said earlier, into the acquis, but it has been done with very little transparency. Not a single piece of information, nor a single consultation, has been addressed to Parliament during this process; neither on the association of the United Kingdom, nor on the incorporation of Greece, nor on the negotiations with Norway and Iceland. The same is true with regard to immigration policy. We have amused ourselves with a pile of reports, but we have no idea what has happened to these initiatives; they have disappeared. We hope that 2000 will be the year for action, in the same way that 1999 was the year for expectations. We hope that the Council will also make an effort to subject itself to the control of this Parliament. The Council has decided that justice and home affairs policy must form part of the structure of the Union. The Council can act in accordance with Parliament' s decisions, or it can continue to miserably begrudge its association with the other institutions in this vitally important project. If it chooses the second approach, it must be aware that this presents risks and that it will weaken the basis on which the area of freedom, security and justice is built."	de
One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is. We need to do something about it. Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget. A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done. We need to take this responsibility seriously. We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who prosecutes? That is where we really get into difficulty. Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers? We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States. The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one. We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people. But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions. Of most importance to Parliament, as the guardian of the budget of the European Union, is how to deal with people who work within the European Union institutions. At a time when we are looking at the whole reform process it is critical that we send the right signal. People need to understand that if they commit fraud they will be prosecuted, and that is not the case at the moment. The whole question as to whether we have the legal authority to do this has been outlined by Mrs Palacio. I should like to make clear that my group is going to propose an amendment deleting the detail of how the Commission should tackle this question. We are aware that it is a delicate debate. We know that the Commission may perhaps need the scope to negotiate a situation which would be acceptable to all parties. Can I just make it clear that we have no commitment to a corpus juris here, no commitment to a federal European public prosecutor. But there is a definite commitment to change the status quo which is totally unacceptable. Mr President, I would like to start by congratulating Mrs Theato on her report. I think it is a first-class report which will, for the most part, be supported by my group. I just have the distinct feeling that she would have preferred to take it a little further at this stage. Judging from the discussions held over the past five or six months, this could well be the case. We all know that, in 1995, it was agreed that the Union' s financial interests should be given better protection under criminal law.	es
I refer to Cuba' s expression of intent, of 2 February, to become a full member of the ACP group of countries. A Cuban delegation attended the last meeting of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in Nassau, and Vice-Chancellor Dalmau spoke in the plenary session, engaging in a lively debate, and afterwards held conversations with many of us. Following Nassau, a delegation from Parliament led by Mr Corrie and the Chairman of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, Joaquín Miranda, visited Havana and a series of very illuminating exchanges of opinion took place. It is my impression that this mission from the European Parliament was the final push which convinced our Cuban friends that the time had come to move forward on mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union. We are witnessing events of great political significance and I hope that we in the European Parliament can promote the appropriate favourable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, so that Cuba' s aspirations can meet with a positive response as soon as possible. That is important, for at least three reasons. First, it is important for Cuba, to bring its people development and prosperity and finally break the United States blockade, which has been repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations. Secondly, we must bear in mind that Cuba' s application has the support of all the ACP countries. If the European Union responds positively to the recommendation of our associates, we will be proving our respect and consideration for those associates and this will have positive effects on the whole framework of our cooperation with them. Nor can we ignore the value of such a decision in demonstrating the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and the fact that it does not bow to pressure from any quarter. By accepting Cuba into the ACP community we will be demonstrating that our Europe is not involved in the shameful process of 'playing but not paying' , and that, when we get indignant about absurdities like the Helms-Burton Act, we are not being hypocritical but are ready to act and take all the consequences. The ACP-EU Joint Assembly meets again in a few weeks time and I am sure this subject will be dealt with there. Ideally the European Parliament' s representatives should be able to support Cuba' s intent at those proceedings, as our parliamentary colleagues from the ACP countries will no doubt be doing. Of course, Cuba must meet all the standard conditions, just like any other member. The Cubans know that and I am sure they accept it. It must also be made clear that Cuba is not going to be asked for more than has been asked of our other partners. Cuba' s wish to join is welcome and Cuba will be welcome in our circle. I say that wholeheartedly, but also with the deep conviction that, just as the blockade has produced nothing but poverty and, as a consequence of that, extreme tension and a hardening of the Cuban position, the integration we are supporting here, and the prosperity it will produce, will translate into the détente and openness we all seek and from which all of us, especially the Cuban people, will benefit.	es
We have taken fifteen years to achieve Economic and Monetary Union. We can take fifteen years for the defence and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be clear. I also believe that we should not underestimate, and this is a question that I put to you, the stranglehold and the force of the lobbies of the foreign ministries. We know the strength that they have acquired over these forty years of building the Community. Today, they would have everything to lose from the communitarisation of foreign policy, and I believe that they are working with that in mind. Finally, with regard to Kosovo - Mr Cohn-Bendit was right to emphasise this point - I believe that it is urgent that the European Union raise the question of the status of Kosovo. Without this status, there will only be instability, murders, provocation by Belgrade and it is a matter of urgency that the European Union should come to a decision on this matter. Finally, I should like to thank Mr Poettering because I believe that the Belgian initiatives, as we say in common parlance, are getting a bit much. I think many Member States among the fourteen other Member States would have many reasons not to cooperate in European Union meetings on justice, for example. Four years after the arrest of Mr Dutroux and his associates, we have still not had a trial, and we still do not know what is happening. As far as tourism is concerned, there will be many people in these fourteen Member States who could consider discouraging parents of young children from taking holidays in Belgium, for example. So the time has come and I would ask Mr Solana and Mr Patten to tell Mr Michel that perhaps he is going a bit too far and that finally it may backfire on him, which is what I hope will happen. Mr President, first of all, I would like to warmly congratulate Mr Solana on this first day of March, for a number of frameworks have been put in place today which have a bearing on European security and defence policy. But I do wonder what his own view is on this. According to the documents, cooperation with the High Representative was fruitful. You said yourself just now that you talked to them over lunch. You have to admit, it would be a rather odd if you were not on speaking terms with them and if there was a lack of cooperation between you and the new frameworks. But do you not regret the fact that you do not preside over them yourself and are not their leading light? I - and I believe many with me in Parliament - would like you to be the driving force behind them and would not want you to run the risk of being sidelined to some extent. Over the past couple of months, High Representative Solana and Commissioner Patten have, during discussions, among other things, with members of the NATO Assembly, tried to separate the defence policies of the EU and NATO.	fr
"But I do give you credit for your intense work, the number of meetings held, your efforts to create a rapid intervention force, your specific efforts to prevent crises, to manage them or stop them through civilian means and, if necessary, by military means. I should like to take advantage of your presence here today to ask you two questions of the ""what is to be done"" variety. The first concerns the forthcoming European Councils in June and December, without counting the extraordinary Council meeting in Lisbon. What are the main priorities that you hope to achieve at the next summit meetings? And finally, what do you most need at these next summits? My second question is different, although it is not unconnected with the previous one. It concerns the next IGC. Do you not think that the agenda of the IGC should include the question of European security and defence policy in order to supplement the treaties, if it appeared that, as the texts of the treaties stand at the moment, they do not allow for a real defence policy to be established? I believe that the Italian President of the Council mentioned this point at your meeting on 24 February. Can you tell us your position on this subject? Mr President, Bosnia and Kosovo have shaken Europe. At long last, the European Union realises that it cannot afford to always give the Americans the political and military initiative. The decision to set up our own peace force is excellent. However, if Europe wants to take military action at crucial times, the Treaty must include a flexibility clause. Mr Solana can play an important role in this. He is not stupid. Certainly not! He is a driven man, a competent man. But the question remains as to whether this accumulation of responsibilities exceeds even his level of competence. In addition to being Secretary-General of the Council, Mr Solana is also Secretary-General of the WEU, as well as High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy. He also heads the Unity Policy Planning and the New Early Warning Unit. One wonders whether he gets any time to sleep, Mr President. From a democratic point of view, I actually find this accumulation of responsibilities unacceptable. This is exacerbated by the fact that Mr Solana is, of course, not a democratically elected politician, but a high official who is not accountable to any parliament. His position threatens to eclipse that of Commissioner Patten, as has been illustrated again today, in fact. It appears that, as European security and defence policy takes shape, the Commission and Parliament are increasingly being left out in the cold. This too is unacceptable in my view. Naturally, every attempt should be made to make European policy more efficient, but this should not lead to unwished-for concentrations of power. Mr Solana must keep Europe awake without nodding off himself. Mr President, peace is the European Union' s very raison d' être. I am pleased about the fact that Commissioner Patten and Mr Solana have already underlined this repeatedly."	it
Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work. I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes. This is a crucial goal. In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required. . (SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do. In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role. For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission. If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up. My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women. This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field. I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement. I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up. I hope that this will be of benefit. Question No 43 by (H-0045/00): Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence. What is more, a very large warehouse has been constructed, in respect of which it is proving difficult to secure access to the planning permission and other infrastructures are planned by the Drogheda Corporation. How can the Commission ensure that this sort of development financed through the Structural Funds does not conflict with the nature conservation needs of the area? Is the Commission ready to suspend funding completely, pending a review of the development plans of the area? The Commission is aware of the construction of the harbour, but we know nothing about the warehouse or the rest of the infrastructure mentioned by the honourable Member. The harbour construction project is receiving support from the Structural Funds and chiefly involves dredging the river Boyne Estuary and depositing the mud on the mudflats at Stegrennan. The Boyne Estuary is designated a special protection area under the Wild Birds Directive. That means that any development that takes place in or near the Boyne Estuary and that is likely to affect the special protection area must take account of the protection criteria for the area laid down in the Community' s Habitats Directive.	it
You have the fine, charming idea that the outcome and the benchmark for your policy and for your five-year programme will be the result of the elections, or rather the turnout at the next European elections. When I think that I have to explain your work programme week in, week out to my constituents, not in the rarefied atmosphere of this House, but on the street, then I ask myself, what can I say? Mr Prodi, what can I say; what is there that is new? There is nothing new in your work programme. You have taken 12 pages for five years and 18 pages for one year' s work programme. Does that give me hope for the year 2000? No, it does not! In your work programme for 2000 you state something quite clever. You say that environmental considerations must be integrated into all other policy areas. Have you done so, Mr Prodi; have you even read your work programme for the year? No, you have not done so. You have not integrated environmental policy into enlargement, despite the fact that it will be one of the fundamental problems of enlargement. Nor have you integrated it into economic policy, competition or the internal market. You have not integrated it anywhere. You have tacked a few components together but you have no overall structure. You said earlier in your speech that a disaster such as that of the Danube is an example of the need for an emergency structure; no, Mr Prodi, we need, at long last, to start transposing legislation and ensuring that legislation is monitored. You say in your five-year programme that the people of the European Union rightly expect food standards to be higher and better foodstuffs legislation. Mr Prodi, you do not know what you are talking about. The foodstuffs legislation in the European Union is the most ambitious in the world. Where it falls short, what is missing, is transposition in the Member States and monitoring. It is time you took your job seriously, it is time for you, as President of the Commission, to box the Member States on the ears and force them to do their work and fulfil their duties. It is no good spending time on hobbies when there is a day' s work to be done. That is what we expect of you in the next five years. . (ES) Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, as chairman of this Parliament' s Committee on Fisheries, Mr Prodi, you are not making things easy for me at all. I feel duty bound to publicly denounce the fact that fishing is absent from the programme which you have presented to us. The next five years of the Prodi Commission - as you solemnly announce in the first of your conclusions - will mean great change. I hope that this change will not mean an even greater marginalisation of fishing, since the silence of your programme, with regard to fishing, is deafening. Not a single line, nor a single word, refers to fishing or the CFP. I am not asking for details or specific points, but I believe that a mention was required. How could you completely ignore a common - I repeat; common - policy with such an economic, social and regional impact, and which therefore affects the economic and social cohesion of Europe?	de
At this stage, I would simply like to say that I would like to see it integrated into the programming for Objective 2 rural areas, in the way that the EAGGF Guidance Section is for Objective 1 regions. In any event, I appreciate the vigilance of your Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development in this matter. Before concluding, I should like to tell Mr Savary that we are going to have a special debate tomorrow on the consequences of the storms which have struck France, Austria and Germany, in particular, in the last few weeks, and at the same time we shall once again be discussing, together with my fellow Commissioner, Mrs de Palacio, what lessons we might draw in the matter of the oil spillage which has also affected the coasts of France. I shall therefore reserve the right, if you permit, sir, to give you my own opinion, which, to a great extent, matches your own recommendation regarding what action we might take to combat the oil spillage using Objective 2. I shall remind you that the Commission is going to be approving the Objective 2 zoning plans for France, Sweden, Austria and Luxembourg tomorrow. We shall then have an appropriate tool for working, particularly in the majority of the regions affected by the storms. Indeed, this is my reason for paying a personal visit the day after tomorrow to two of the French departments which have been severely disabled by the storms. In conclusion, with thanks for your understanding, Mr President, I should like to thank you, Mrs Schroedter, for the quality of your work and that of the committee, and to tell you that I am very pleased, apart from a few differences in our assessments of the role of the guidelines. We have discussed this and I have attempted to clarify my point of view. I am very pleased with the level of support offered by your House to the Commission in establishing these guidelines, which have been submitted to the Member States for information when establishing their own programmes. This can only reinforce the concept based on a number of elements of good practice drawn from our experience of the current 1994-1999 programmes. I feel this augurs well for effective cooperation between our two institutions, at this time when programming for the period 2000-2006 is being undertaken, good joint working practice, which is, Mr Hatzidakis, backed up by something I am very attentive to: observance of the code of conduct which links our two institutions. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Social and economic situation and development of the regions of the Union The next item is the debate on the report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union [SEC(99)0066 - C5-0120/99 - 1999/2123(COS)]. Mr President, Commissioner, this sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union constitutes a milestone in the analysis of regional data and highlights the progress made in this area since the issue of the fifth periodic report. I consider, however, that the mention of any real convergence of average regional development levels in Europe offers a somewhat over-simplified view of the situation and, unfortunately, this is often the message taken up in the press and in some speeches.	it
We need to be able to go back with a proper answer. The case of Flora Brovina is just one of many. We are right to include this in the draft resolution, but there are hundreds, even thousands of Flora Brovinas out there. I would ask the Commission and the absent Council at long last to do something for these political prisoners. The fact that they are locked up in Serbia also fuels the unrest and violence in Kosovo. Mr President, in the present joint draft resolution, paragraph 10 urges the Council and Member States - rightly so - to double their efforts so as to make the necessary manpower and resources available for the UN police units. This request is fully in line with the vision held by the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo, Mr Bernard Kouchner. In order to fulfil his mission to restore and maintain public order in Kosovo, he needs, by his own reckoning, at least 6 000 foreign police officers. The UN, however, have pledged to dispatch a police force of 4 800. To date, however, Mr Kouchner only has about 2 000 police troops at his disposal. Moreover, half of this group is from the United States and Germany. It is logical that the Special Representative of the UN in Kosovo is extremely dissatisfied with this situation, especially in the light of the endemic ethnic violence in the region. What is disconcerting, however, is Mr Kouchner' s sharp criticism levelled at the French Government these days. Paris is leaving its fellow-countryman completely in the cold with a handful of policemen, not more than 37, in the crisis region. For this hardly honourable position, Mr Kouchner blames none other than the Minister for Home Affairs, Mr Chevènement. According to Mr Kouchner, the Minister is said to have hindered the efforts of the French police officials on ideological grounds. I would ask the Council and the Commission to look into these serious allegations carefully and inform the European Parliament of the outcome. Press freedom in Angola Mr President, I do not intend to repeat the premise put forward earlier for fear of being accused of improper publicity. On the question of Angola, I think that we would achieve an initial result if we had a resolution at long last. It would be the first in a long time. So I welcome it as such. I think that the European Union and the western world in general has had Mr Savimbi in their crossfire for some time now, with no discrimination whatsoever, but corruption is now so rife in Mr Dos Santos' s regime that even his long-standing friends are starting to find it hard to pretend not to see anything. So I think that we urgently need to get to the point where we can pass a general political resolution in which we can get to the heart of the matter, especially the worrying things which we are discussing, particularly logistics support for the information services by the United States and Great Britain, generalised corruption in the regime linked to multinational oil companies and numerous other extremely 'spicy' matters which we need to go into.	fr
Mr President, Commissioner, the measures contained in this directive range from drafting water management plans, comprehensive information and hearing rights, and close cooperation between the Member States, to combating water pollution caused by individual pollutants. And considering how long this Chamber has been trying to introduce a framework directive of this kind, I am pleased to be present here today, and I would like to congratulate Mrs Lienemann on being in the happy position of presenting this report to us. However, it is also extremely important to me to point something out that many people actually take for granted. I would still like to highlight this point though: this directive does not constitute any kind of legal basis for diverting water from a Member State' s territory against its will. And by way of reaffirming this once again, I have introduced an amendment - gratifyingly with the support of a large number of Members - and I would be very pleased if Parliament would endorse my proposed amendment tomorrow. It is all about making it clear that water - and this is not the first time this has been mentioned today - is no ordinary commodity but a resource which belongs to the individual EU Member States and which must be protected and treated with the respect due to it. I am aware, and the previous speaker highlighted this, that there are States in the European Union that have problems with water. I believe that every one of us, in every country, could improve the way in which we manage our water and could make use of it in a cleaner way. This applies to every country. But only when each country has done its utmost to conserve its water resources, when literally everything has been done that could have been done in our own countries, only then, in my view, should it be necessary to start thinking in terms of harmonising water usage. Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading. However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings. Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist. In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant. It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of. This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun.	es
However, there must be an appropriate level of supervision on the political side. Furthermore, the tripartite relationship of Commission, Council and Parliament must be restored to the sphere of foreign and security policy, where hitherto the Council was in sole charge far more than should have been the case, especially in relation to the crudely fashioned crisis management measures, for which the Commission alone has responsibility. The overall plan failed to do justice to any of this. We must examine whether any changes are needed to this end which would fall within the scope of the Intergovernmental Conference. The Portuguese Presidency has agreed to initiate deliberations on this matter, perhaps to extend the mandate. There is another point I would just like to draw your attention to. The debates we are having these days, on a certain European country' s government, for example, show, do they not, that we must place the spiritual, moral, constitutional, community and common welfare-orientated leanings of the European Union on a firm footing, and that legally binding fundamental rights must also be incorporated into the Treaty for the same reason, as this will be a crucial stabilising factor. I would urge those who are still very hesitant in this respect to consider whether now is not the time to make this connection and perhaps pluck up the courage we need to make suitable progress in matters of fundamental rights. The European Union needs few, if any, new instruments, and it does not need any new competences. What it does need are instruments that will enable it to put its competences into practice. For this reason, we must ensure that the instruments have the effect of enabling us to carry out, on behalf of the citizens, the tasks we have already formally been set in the Treaty. In my view, that is the most important issue this Intergovernmental Conference has to concentrate its energies on. If we succeed in making progress here, then we will also be ready for the historic task of enlarging the European Union. This is the crux of the matter. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, I am confident that this will be tackled in a suitably positive manner under your tutelage. , chairman of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs. (IT) Mr President-in-Office, on listening to the various interventions, you have understood that in the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and also among the leaders of Parliament' s political groups, the decision prevailed - although not without some disagreement - to put our faith in the Portuguese Presidency, instead of creating more difficulties by postponing the start of the Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that it was not easy to achieve this, last week in the Committee I chair, but we eventually decided to back the Portuguese Presidency and we would like to win this wager. You spoke to us about the start of your tour around the various capital cities and told us about the difficulties that some governments have in reaching a consensus in their own countries, and therefore in their parliaments. I would like you to bear in mind that yesterday we had a very worthwhile day of discussions and dialogue with the representatives of the 15 national parliaments, which were represented by competent and exacting delegations.	es
We are concerned about stability on the financial markets, not for the sake of the financial markets, but because this has to do with own growth, our own investments and our own jobs in the European Union. We must ask what instruments we can use in order to create the order here which has been missing in the past. We have done everything to help liberalise financial transactions, but so far we have had no working set of rules, as we have learned from the bitter lessons of the repercussions of the Asian and Latin American crises. It is therefore high time that we thought both about supervisory regulations and about transparency on the financial markets and their information. It is important that we know who the actors are and what their credit rating is. We must also ask if there is not a need for fiscal justice. At a time when the tax burden on the work factor is increasing throughout Europe and internationally, we must consider how we can achieve efficient taxation of investment income and that includes the question of how to tax short-term financial transactions. I think that we really do need a careful report and conclusions from the Commission, so that we as the European Parliament can see if we need to ensure that the European Union achieves real international solidarity with the USA and Japan in making the economy and the financial markets more stable and secure. This is the intention behind the question and we must then follow the ordinary procedures of reports from committees and plenary debate in order to reach a balanced and really forward-looking proposal. Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must express my surprise at this debate on the international movement of capital and its possible taxation which, although it does not mention it in the text, appears to be an attempt to revive, as the introduction has done, the issue of the tax proposed some years ago by Mr Tobin, which our Group opposed, clearly and totally, during the last legislature, with a series of arguments clearly and coherently expressed by our President, Mr Cox. I will have to repeat these arguments, modestly, in this intervention, because the same issue has arisen once again. We do not agree with this type of tax because its application, in the event that it could happen, would not achieve the aims which Mr Tobin presented at the time and which the Left in this House wishes to revive. Firstly, there is no evidence that the tax on international capital movements could reduce the dangers of volatility and instability in the international markets. On the contrary, since it is certain that not all countries would accept it, we would open the way to speculation and fraud and that really would create volatility, instability, insecurity, opacity and unfair competition in the field of financial services operating on an international level. Furthermore, the idea of obtaining resources to apply them to the more economically needy countries presents such complexity, when we consider their application in practice, that it appears simply impossible.	fr
The other area of concern related to the range of data to be collected under the regulation. First, in respect to economic data, Amendment No 2 makes two changes. One attempts to ensure that the data sought are no more detailed than necessary to serve the objective being pursued. The other replaces a reference to income from sales and other revenue, subsidies, interest received, etc., with a reference simply to volume of sales. It is considered that without these changes undesirably high costs in the collection of data could be incurred in Member States and that there could also be serious problems of confidentiality. In conjunction with these changes, Amendment No 5 deletes a reference to accounting headings accordingly. Secondly, in respect to the environmental data, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information. The Commission has, however, made it clear that it intends itself to engage in studies and pilot projects of a wider environmental kind. It has also made it clear that it may wish to extend the range of data being collected by Member States at a later stage. Amendment No 3 brings into the ambit of the current regulation data of the kind needed to monitor changes in aquatic ecosystems. This will certainly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation concerning environmental data and may even render this unnecessary. It should be stressed that the Amendment does not in any way require the Commission to include the collection of such data either under the minimum or the extended programmes it establishes. It merely permits the Commission to do so should it so wish. As already stated the proposal for the Council decision falls into two parts. The first is concerned with financing the Member States in implementing the Community programmes. The second is to allow the Commission itself to finance pilot studies and projects. There are some minor amendments: Amendment No 2 aims to ensure that the financial contribution to Member States can cover not only the costs of collection of data but also those of its management, compilation, aggregation, etc. Amendments Nos 3 and 6 aim to smooth the timescale given that Member States will have to wait until the implementing regulation is in place to know what the programmes actually involve; and also to bring the timescale into line with the dates and the regulation. Amendments Nos 4 and 5 aim to ensure that financial information is forwarded continuously to the budgetary authority. More significantly, under Amendment No 1, the Fisheries Committee accepts the recommendation of the Budgets Committee that the funding should be placed under heading 1(b) rather than heading 3 of the Financial Perspective. Although in its preliminary draft budget the Commission entered the appropriations under heading 3 'Internal Policies' , Parliament created a new budget line B1-500 to finance the measures under discussion. This provides a safeguard to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available. ) Mr President, I believe we totally agree with Mrs Attwooll' s statement at the beginning of her excellent report that these two Commission proposals, intended to shed more light on the scientific and socio-economic situation of the fisheries sector, come at a critical time.	it
Madam President, Mr Prodi, we are pleased about the overall intention of the objectives announced which are in line with the challenges which Europe must overcome. I note that you consider the fall of the Berlin wall to be the crucial factor of the end of the century. This event must underpin enlargement. Rather than using the word 'enlargement' , I want to talk of reunification which has much greater political significance. Your idea is to concentrate your activities on the core tasks. This is one of the goals of your reform. In essence this means applying the principle of subsidiarity. Precise application of this principle can only reinforce the actions taken and give our citizens a clear view of each level of competence. However, saying is one thing and doing is another! You must therefore fight against the tendency of all institutions to try and increase their powers. I will therefore judge you on your deeds. In the meantime, I approve and encourage this clearly expressed desire in your communication. However, I must make two essential points. These concern the simplification and application of Community law. In 1998, 123 referrals were made to the Court of Justice for non-application or non-transposition and 25% of environmental directives were not applied or transposed. Recent events have shown us that these regulations are essential. Community law must not go unapplied because it is too complex or too pedantic. The Union must not make this mistake and I therefore regret the fact that your communication does not go into more detail on this. You are being realistic when you say that the welfare state can no longer provide adequate responses to the problems facing us, including unemployment. Nevertheless, I regret that a clear alternative has not been proposed. The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any policy of handouts and instead on the development of initiative and responsibility. You have not highlighted the ageing of our population which will fundamentally alter the structure of our society, not only economically but also in terms of public health. This is a silent revolution and in this respect I expected more from your communication. Finally, you do highlight European research as being at the heart of our future. Yet you do not indicate the resources you intend to implement to achieve this. Also, ethical principles are at the heart of this research but your communication says nothing about these. If you want to better inform the people, you should start by strengthening liaison with this House, as we are the representatives of the citizens. Madam President, we can only endorse the general guidelines of the five-year programme and of the programme for 2000, set out with so much enthusiasm by President Prodi this morning. In the two documents, strong emphasis is placed on the need to define new forms of European governance and, to this end, to introduce a new agenda for the Commission, establishing more stringent priorities in the pursuit of the goal of full employment, through more efficient coordination of the economic and social policies of the States, and, primarily - allow me to stress this - of the nations that have joined the monetary union and which must be enabled to become the first example of closer cooperation.	it
USD 1 800 billion is the volume of money moved every day in the world' s currency markets. This represents over a quarter of the annual global volume of trade in goods and services. By putting finance at the helm, this has reinforced the demands of profitability and toughened the operating conditions everywhere. It has led to a growth in mergers, acquisitions and company restructuring and to gigantic sums being raised with increasing frequency on the financial markets. Unemployment and pressure on employees worldwide is increasing. Openings and real growth are being hampered and the sudden influx or withdrawal of speculative capital is threatening the economies of many countries, to the point of collapse, as in Asia, Russia and Brazil. Faced with this neoliberal globalisation dominated by the financial markets, demand, as our motion recognises, is developing from a different idea of the world in which common law stipulates a duty of solidarity in an increasingly interdependent world. No one can ignore the challenge to civilisation posed by the lack of nearly one billion jobs and the need to make unprecedented efforts in terms of development and access to information. In this respect, all ideas deserve to be considered, including the Tobin tax which is important, just like other forms of transaction which may be envisaged. This tax could help to check speculation without penalising the activities of the real economy. It could release new resources for investment in people and, at a time when the UNDP estimates the sum needed to eradicate poverty to be USD 40 billion per year, it could allow access for everyone to drinking water and satisfy health needs. When the debate on the ability of politics to influence economics goes global, the establishment of this tax could become one of the symbols of the political desire to recapture the democratic areas seized by the international financial operators. The Commissioner has said that a minimum number of industrialised countries would be needed to achieve this. I would point out that the European Union is composed of a large number of industrialised countries and, like Mr Désir and several other speakers, I feel that the European Union which we are forming can take the initiative in this respect. In any case, the European Parliament would be honoured to take up the call of the people to control the world in order to achieve a sense of well-being for everyone. Madam President, I too am delighted that we are having this debate. I only regret that it has been so long in coming. We know that each generation has, over the course of time, blindly bought into what could be called a dominant ideology. This is a set of prejudices accepted as such due to a general conformism, but whose dramatic nature can be seen by subsequent generations. Free trade and the constant worship of globalisation are now the dominant ideology or, rather, the big mistake of our fin de siècle. This ideology is as dangerous as the former ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat in the corridors of the Kremlin or, before that, the certainty, elevated to the status of a dogma, that the earth was flat.	it
I am sure that, with the willingness that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of understanding between us, will be to take account of the motion for a resolution which we will submit to you. Question Time (Council) The next item is Question Time (B5-0003/2000). We will examine questions to the Council. Question No 1 by (H-0780/99): Subject: Construction of nuclear plant in earthquake-prone Turkey The two recent earthquakes in Turkey registering more than 7 on the Richter scale raise tremendous doubts about Turkey's persistence with the construction of costly nuclear reactors at Akkuyu, while energy reserves produced by the Atatürk dams are exported to third countries and the EU spends a slice of its budget on repairing the damage wrought by the earthquakes. Turkey's nuclear plans B which ignore the risks to the population and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding region B prompt the suspicion that there are underlying plans previously determined by Turkey's political and military leaders to acquire nuclear technology enabling them to build nuclear weapons, as evidenced by their attempts to buy reactors of Canadian origin of the type acquired by India and Pakistan. What steps will the Council take to prevent nuclear accidents and the proliferation of nuclear weapons in a country that wishes to join the EU but spends enormous amounts on nuclear programmes while receiving financial aid from the EU budget? Mr President, the Council wishes to point out that Turkey is a signatory to the Convention on Nuclear Safety, the objectives of which should allay the fears expressed by Mr Souladakis. The aim of this convention, which came into force on 24 October 1996, is precisely to achieve and maintain a high standard of nuclear safety at world level by means of national measures and through international cooperation. It further aims to ensure that nuclear installations are equipped with continuing protection against potential radiological risks, so as to protect individuals, society at large and the environment against the harmful effects of the ionising radiation that can be emitted by such installations. The convention, as you will be aware, also covers the prevention of accidents which have radiological effects and the limitation of such effects when incidents of this kind occur. I would also like to remind Members that, as a candidate for membership of the European Union, Turkey will - and this is a pre-accession condition, which is an important point - sooner or later, as part of its own pre-accession strategy, have to adopt a set of policies geared towards adopting the entire acquis communautaire in good time, and including therefore all provisions already in force on nuclear safety. Thank you for your answer. However, I would just like to add the following. Turkey is only looking to increase its energy potential by 2% with this unit. Nevertheless, rumour has it that it plans to buy Candu reactors of the type acquired by Pakistan and India which were used for nuclear weapons.	es
(Applause from the right) It is via diplomacy, persuasion, knowledge, and solidarity, and not with threats or via anti-constitutional means that the institutions can ensure respect for themselves and for principles. Bilateral relations involve the States, so the 14 do not come into this. This is riding roughshod over the European institutions in order to defend political ways of thinking, with an incompetence worthy of parties which have just emerged from totalitarian regimes. It is not what you would expect of the representatives of democratic traditions. So many things set us apart from Mr Haider - as we have often written - including his claim to the completely Italian Alto Adige region. However, we already knew this. However, today we are concerned to learn that other representatives of the Union seem to have turned their backs on the Union' s democratic role. We support legality and democracy as expressed by the peoples, and favour upholding national sovereignty as long as this does not violate the principles of the Treaty or human rights. We believe in Europe, while it seems that others have started the process of breaking up the Union. This is what has come of rushing headlong into enlargement and not clearly defining roles and tasks. We have built a Europe with an unstable market, not a Europe with principles, rights and politics. And these are the consequences! Therefore, we can but call on the Commission to continue to show restraint and praise those who are working to safeguard the independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people, thereby ensuring that this people retains its freedoms and maintains good relations with other peoples. Madam President, today we have an appointment with hypocrisy. Here we have a Council which has managed to flout the treaty and employ a method completely unrelated to Articles 6 and 7 which make it possible to condemn a State in the event of a serious and persistent breach. In the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach in Austria. There are risks, as we are all aware, but in the event there is absolutely no serious and persistent breach. If we were to apply the criteria of Articles 6 and 7 or the Copenhagen criteria to the European Union, then, most certainly, this European Union could not become a member, although the countries of Eastern Europe are required to meet them. And if we were to speak of serious and persistent breaches, then perhaps we could mention some Member States, such as Italy and France, first and third, respectively, in the list of countries condemned by the Council of Europe and the Strasbourg court. We could mention, my Belgian friends, Belgium and the Dutroux case, the dozens upon dozens of children kidnapped, tortured, raped and murdered by leading personalities in this country, where inquiries are bogged down, making no headway. We could, if one third of the Members of Parliament so requested, require that the Council and the Commission look into the matter. We could ask ourselves why the Austrians are rejecting 10 years, 13 years of party politics which has made one country - Austria - corrupt and rotten, just as it is now corrupting countries such as Italy, Belgium and other European Union Member States.	fr
So, we will try to be very clear about how and when to use it. Mr President, Commissioner, regarding the relationship between science, on the one hand, and applying the precautionary principle on the other, the communication states that invoking that precautionary principle always requires a political decision if there is a lack of scientific evidence. Needless to say, this accords science a great deal of power. We might ask ourselves, what kind of scientists will supply this documentation and what do they stand for? The communication also states that the precautionary principle can be applied, provided there is a sufficient recognised minority of scientists. I would like to ask, what is, then, the definition of a recognised minority? How would you describe this? What establishes a recognised minority? If a political decision is involved, I would also like to ask: who takes this political decision? The Commission? The Council? And to what extent will the European Parliament be able to play a role in this? What is the role of the scientific committees? What, also, will be the role of the food authorities which you are about to set up? Finally, will this whole decision-making process be carried out in a transparent, public way? These are my three questions. . Yes, Mr President, that is true. There were many and difficult issues and not always crystal clear, but I will try to answer some questions. Who will take the decision, who are the decision-makers? Well, that depends on who the legislators are. This is part of risk management. They have to look at, for example, the concerns of people in relation to a special issue, and they have to judge from what is known about the scientific evidence in a certain case. However, it is true that it does not need a big majority of the scientific community to be able to use the precautionary principle. It can be used on evidence from a minority or where science is incomplete. That is, of course, where you strike a balance between this principle as a political tool and science. It is not always easy to describe exactly how this process is done, but there is no question of changing the scientific base. We use the experts to get as much scientific information and facts as possible before we take a decision; and that should also be done in the future. You have to see this as a tool for risk management. You have to decide whether you want to put people in danger, for example, or if you want to protect the environment; and you have to look at the science that is available. You have to assess all that and evaluate the science. Then you decide to take a measure or not, to take action or not. So, there is no answer to all your questions but this does not change the system of the scientists that we use today or the system of experts that we use today. Mr President, I have a question concerning an actual, concrete case in which it should be possible to apply the precautionary principle.	es
There are two reasons why we are saying no. Firstly, these are immensely complicated and very sensitive legal questions which are at issue and, to my mind, the proposal entails some risks to legal certainty, which have not been fully realised. This is in itself sufficient reason for us to deny our support. The other main reason, however, is that, even though we are concerned here with a Convention (and therefore with international cooperation), there is no doubt about the trend expressed in the proposal. And the trend is towards creating, in the longer term, a common European area of jurisdiction, common EU criminal law and common EU administration of justice. We would warn against that trend. We have this AFSJ mantra - Area of Freedom, Security and Justice - the full enormity of which lies in its establishment of EU systems which will play havoc with existing legal traditions relating to these sensitive and important questions which are overwhelmingly national in character. Mr President, I too agree that the convention that we are examining is but a small step - and still too small a step - towards the construction of the common area of freedom, security and justice which Europe will hopefully one day become. It is today an area for the free movement of goods and persons, in which there are no frontiers to crime, but in which significant barriers still exist to those whose duty it is to combat crime. A small step - I say - but nonetheless a welcome one, for which the Committee on Citizens' Freedoms and Rights, Justice and Home Affairs has quite correctly wanted to prescribe further restrictions and guarantees in the name of the defence of the fundamental rights of the individual that are in force in the Member States and in the Union itself, even if these are not yet enshrined in a European Union charter of rights, which we hope will soon come into being: just restrictions and guarantees because, unfortunately, existing rights are, in practice, not always respected by every public authority in every Member State. Certain isolated passages in the Commission' s proposal perhaps err on the side of caution, as is the case when it is maintained that the detainee accused should be given the choice of whether to accept or refuse temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union for the purposes of preliminary enquiries. I personally find it unacceptable, for example, for Mr Pinochet to be given the option to move to Spain for a confrontation. Or when it is maintained that the witness or expert witness - and not simply the defendant - should have a counsel at their side during examination via a video or telephone link. These are nevertheless minor flaws, which the rapporteur did not want and which - I hope - will be remedied when this Chamber comes to vote. The rapporteur has made laudable efforts, which should not go unnoted and for which I would like to thank him. The overall result is remarkable and I hope that the Council will fully take it into account. There is, as has already been said, one point still to resolved, which is also the most delicate one: it concerns article 18 of the convention, which relates to the interception of communications originating in one Member State, but which are directly performed by another Member State, without the assistance being requested of the State in which the interception is being carried out, something which is now possible thanks to the latest technology.	fr
The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States. It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform. We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union. Having said this, Mr President, this Parliament is holding this debate today because we did not want to delay the start of the Conference. In theory, we could have done so. We could have voted on the 17th of this month and the Conference would not have been able to start on the 14th. However, we did not want to do this because we wish to send a clear political signal to the governments and the candidate countries that we want this reform to take place, precisely in order to facilitate enlargement. Mr President, I am very happy to be able to say this to the Portuguese Presidency because it has earned great respect in this Assembly. The Portuguese Presidency shares many of this Parliament' s aspirations and has committed itself to doing everything it can to ensure that the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference is widened to include other essential issues. Mr President, I would like to point out that this aspiration on the part of the European Parliament is not an aspiration to gain benefits for the European Parliament itself. However, the European Parliament will be reinforced politically by the Treaty resulting from this Intergovernmental Conference. This is for one very simple reason: according to the agreements made in Helsinki, this Intergovernmental Conference will lead to issues, which are currently decided unanimously, being decided by a qualified majority. Therefore, the number of issues decided by a qualified majority will increase. It is already established within the Community acquis that those legislative issues which are decided by a qualified majority are also subject to codecision with Parliament. Therefore, since the qualified majority will be extended, there will also be more codecision with Parliament. However, this Parliament would not be fulfilling its role as a supranational European institution if it did not consider the political design of the Union. That it is what we are doing. We believe that, in the political design of the Union, other issues need to be dealt with. These include, amongst others, the incorporation into the Treaty of security and defence issues, which have made much progress recently, but which must be incorporated into the Treaty. Of course there is also the Charter of Fundamental Rights, and work began on its wording yesterday, which I believe has started very positively. We are going to work seriously to ensure that the Europeans come to see being European as an advantage and that European citizens have certain fundamental rights which are connected to the Union' s institutions. Therefore, Mr President, our proposals, which we will specify in another report, together with the proposals of the Commission, which has produced an excellent document - and I am happy to be able to say this here to Mr Barnier - are going to be used as conference documents.	fr
Mind you, even the Resolution of the Finnish Council Presidency in June was not the best result that could have been done achieved. There are certain weaknesses, the greatest of which, in my opinion, is that not enough consideration is being given to the situation of small businesses; after all, the car industry is more than just large companies. It is in the area of supply that small business plays an important role and we must not fail to also take account of the interests of those employed in small and medium-sized enterprises. For there are considerably more than two million people employed in this sector. The plight of small businesses is also addressed by numerous amendments from the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and also the amendments in question from our group to Article 5 concerning costs. The common position is also no great shakes from an environmental viewpoint. It fails to take in the bigger picture and when my fellow delegate from the Greens says that this is the first time that the European Parliament has toned down a common position, I really must object, because quite simply, it is not environmentally meaningful to restrict the use of modern, low-consumption cars such as the 3-litre car, which contain a great deal of plastic, by means of rigid, high recycling quotas! Consequently, we must support an amendment which at least permits exceptions in the case of particularly economical cars. The objections of the industry in this matter are certainly not without foundation. However, the arguments of the plastics and car industries would be more persuasive if a commitment were to be given to reducing CO2 levels in Europe in other sectors besides these. Mr President, we are indeed now in a very rare situation: those who wish to uphold environmental values will take the side of the Council in their common position. In contrast to what the previous speaker said, I can say I am really proud that a common position was achieved during the Finnish Presidency to uphold environmental values. If we slide away from the common position and try to divide the recycling costs, we will be creating a loophole: we will not have created a rational, clear system in which the division of responsibilities is in order. That is why, in my opinion, the manufacturer must take the greatest share of the responsibility. Only then will we find an adequate solution to the problem, taking into consideration the fact too that the manufacturer should be encouraged to make vehicles whose parts can be recycled at the smallest possible cost in the future. Mr President, there are two issues of principle in the Council' s draft directive. The first concerns the manufacturer' s unrestricted liability to take back end-of-life vehicles. There is the risk of creating a monopoly within the car dismantling trade. This particularly applies in areas within the EU where distances are great and where a lot of small companies are involved in dismantling vehicles. I believe that, quite apart from the nature of the issue concerned, the EU' s directives should not treat small companies within the Union unfairly. Unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers would also be in danger of creating a situation in which the market for used car parts disappears, for manufacturers would have a greater responsibility to sell new parts. Yet the trade in used car parts is important, especially for those who collect and renovate older vehicles. The principle of unrestricted liability on the part of manufacturers is also dubious in terms of the principles governing the market economy. It should be possible for changes to be made to companies and for the latter to be sold and wound up. They should be able to establish themselves in new markets, but also to leave old markets. To bind manufacturers by means of a liability which can extend very far back in time ill accords with a flexible market economy designed to promote development.	de
"First, I must stress that the debate about social protection issues began several years ago among the European bodies and since 1995 there has been the first statement entitled: ""The future of social protection"" and there have been statements from the European Parliament, those of Mrs Weiler and Mr Pronk. Today, we have the statement by Mr Andersson. I believe we have made considerable progress since we are now talking about the modernisation of social protection. The second point is that we must bear in mind the legal basis by virtue of which the European Commission can operate. You know very well that the Treaty provides no legal basis for policies at European level, but there is the agreement expressed at the last Council, there is agreement that work should begin on coordination and the exchange of experience, as well as the exchange of successful programmes between the Member States. The third observation is that as regards the four issues on which the specific statement focuses, which relate to paid work, the sustainability of pension systems, social convergence and lastly quality in health care, there is a horizontal approach to the issue of women because in each of these categories - as the speakers said - there are special problems relating to women and those problems should in many cases be addressed by separate policies. The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken. As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June. The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession. I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group. Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion. Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment. I think the statement' s content makes this clear. Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies. As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken. Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy. Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. WIPO treaty The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)]."	it
Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. VOTE (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE). Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting. Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system? That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call. You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it. In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on. Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general. It is obvious that some presidents do not look at the hands, so to speak, but go straight to the electronic voting system. I was wondering whether this is the correct procedure. I know it takes longer, but should we not always have a show of hands first? Mr President, as far as the second reading is concerned, the Commission can only accept one proposed amendment put forward by Parliament. The Commission hereby adopts this amendment and accepts it. (The President declared the common position approved (as amended)) Report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road (COM(1999)0158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)) (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0108/1999) by Mrs Schroedter, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication from the Commission in the field of the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Fund: guidelines for programmes in the period 2000-2006 (COM(1999)0344 - C5-0122/1999 - 1999/2127(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0107/1999) by Mr Berend, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the Sixth Periodic Report on the Social and Economic Situation and Development of the Regions of the European Union (SEC(1999)0066 - C5-0120/1999 - 1999/2123(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0069/1999) by Mr von Wogau, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission White Paper on modernisation of the rules implementing Articles 85 and 86 of the EC Treaty (COM(1999)0101 - C5-0105/1999 - 1999/2108(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr Rapkay, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the European Commission' s XXVIIIth Report on Competition Policy (1998) (SEC(1999)0743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution) Report (A5-0087/1999) by Mr Jonckheer, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the seventh survey on state aid in the European Union in the manufacturing and certain other sectors (COM(1999)148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110(COS))	fr
"I would like to make three brief points. The first is that we need a mature dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament. It is barely six months since Amsterdam imposed a duty on our two organisations to work together; we have been sizing each other up, we have had a few minor spats, but we need to work effectively together. Let us stop the shadow-boxing. Let us drop the elaborate charades and let us respect the duties that the Treaties impose on us and the timescales allowed for full democratic debate. Involve us please in your discussions on both policy and process. Let us not pretend that national parliaments are able to exercise effective democratic control of government activities in this area. My second point is that we need a properly resourced Commission. We have established a new Directorate-General, yet it has only 70 people all told. There is an agreement to double this number, but I understand that, so far, not a single new person has arrived. We are setting the Commission a massive task, not least in the drawing up of the scoreboard. The Council and Parliament must work together to provide the resources that the Commission needs. Finally, on the content of the debate, I welcome the fact that the presidency has put the area of freedom, security and justice at the top of its agenda. All good things come in threes, especially in our policy area. Two hundred years ago it was liberty, equality and fraternity, and things went along very well until the governments of the left raised equality above the others. Now it is freedom, security and justice, and I hope that the current governments of the left will heed the words of Commissioner Vitorino and resist the temptation to elevate security, important as it is, above the equally important needs of freedom and justice. Mr President, I would like to join my colleagues in welcoming the representatives of the Council as well as the Commissioner. I thank them for their statements to the House. Rather than go back over the areas that have already been covered I would like to deal with one specific topic: the question of drugs and how we tackle the pervasiveness of the drug culture in our societies. I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States. We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on. But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of ""normalisation"" and ""harm reduction"" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people."	it
And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged. The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes. That is the measure of the problem. It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service. It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide. . Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services. I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein. May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament. Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal. Others believe that it is not so bad after all, if there is a slight pause after the first step of liberalisation. This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr Berthu. The Commission' s position is that the new proposal was delayed mainly owing to the internal problems of the Commission, of which I am sure Parliament is not totally unaware. But we feel that there is a legal obligation for a proposal to be made. It is Commissioner Bolkestein' s intention to present such a proposal to the Commission for adoption in the first half of this year. The scheduled date of 1 January 2003 for implementation of the next steps remains feasible. The proposal will take account of the studies undertaken and in particular look at such issues as universal service, to which I will come back in a second. As regards the existing directive and its implementation, most Member States have taken the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive. A number of problems exist as regards the structure of the regulator and its independence. The implementation deadline for the Member States is January 2003. Further liberalisation will occur afterwards. In some areas competition is already taking place, as in the parcels sector and in the express services. The quality of services has, generally speaking, improved, in particular in regard to cross-border activity. The quality of services, which is so relevant to consumers, was a main concern of all speakers, some of whom, like Mr Rübig, were very explicit on this point. The experiences in countries where liberalisation is more advanced such as Sweden, Finland and the Netherlands, prove that when liberalisation takes place in an orderly way, the quality of service may be raised as a result of higher-quality service requirements imposed by the national regulations and their follow-up. So this is not a selling-out of the service and of its quality. Frequently liberalisation leads to guaranteed standards and the on-going standardisation of the measurement of the quality of service also contributes, as these standards will better reflect actual performance. This will allow for meaningful bench-marking and improved customer orientation by the incumbent operator as a result of the combined pressure by regulators, competitors and customers.	de
This system appears to us to be unsuitable in practical terms. However, in order to compensate for this, all possible obstacles must be removed before the service provision card is issued, and as the Commission' s proposal would have it, more stringent conditions must be satisfied before a service provision card is issued. An individual is required to be in authorised employment and to have the right of residence and insurance protection, not just at the time of issue of the card but throughout its period of validity and for three months thereafter. This should serve as a guarantee for the receiving state that the employee or self-employed person will return to the sending state once the contract is completed and that they will be covered under insurance law in the event of illness or accident. Likewise, the situation with regard to right of entry and residence rights should be clarified before the service provision card is issued, namely under the terms of an opposition procedure. What we are proposing is that it should not just be a case of having to apply for the EU service provision card for all Member States, rather one should also have the option of applying for it for individual Member States. I believe this system is also more suited to practical needs. I would hope that the same holds true for the proposal to reduce the minimum period of duration for a first posting to three months, and to be flexible in adapting the period of validity of the service provision card to the duration of the first posting. However, we stand by our view that the maximum period of validity for the service provision card should be 12 months. When it comes to self-employed persons, in addition to the amendments already described, we propose that the domicile criteria should be made more stringent, and that we should make provision for the possibility of countering any abuse in the way of bogus self-employment. I would also just like to go into those of the proposed amendments that go beyond the proposed amendments put forward by the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market. Of course I would add that I continue to support this committee' s amendments, which they adopted unanimously. I have even submitted four amendments on behalf of my group that largely relate to the correct way of quoting Council decisions. I must say I have received extremely contradictory statements from Parliament' s services as to exactly how these Council decisions should be quoted; whether or not one should use the number or date alone, or both, and how extensively to quote from them. Two amendments were cancelled by the services because the content has supposedly already been given consideration to in the report. I withdraw the two other amendments - that is Amendment No 18 to the report on self-employed persons and Amendment No 21 on employed persons. I can only urge the Conference of Presidents to reach agreement as quickly as possible on the correct way to proceed in matters of comitology, i.e. the correct way to quote. This would make our rapporteur' s life considerably easier in the future. There is also a proposed amendment to both of Mrs De Palacio' s reports. Unfortunately I have to say that I am unable to support this proposed amendment because it in fact changes the substance of the outcome that we in the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market resolved on unanimously, and I would like to stand by this outcome, which we arrived at together after lengthy discussions. On a final note, I would like to thank all those in the Committee who supported me in compiling these reports, which were far from easy to produce.	de
Since 1997, however, the really significant results have failed to materialise. So far, the Cologne Employment Pact has not been able to be invested with sufficient content. In addition, the macroeconomic dialogue lacks the participation of the European Parliament as an equal partner. Yes, some aspects of the Luxembourg employment policy guidelines have not been applied rigorously enough by the Member States, in particular, for example, in the field of lifelong learning, as the 1999 Joint Employment Report noted. In information technology, in particular, some European countries lack qualified workers, as Mr Suominen emphasised. Rather than 'importing' them from third countries, it is better to invest accordingly in vocational training and further education, to invest in human capital. This is the most effective way of reducing unemployment. The most important objective of the Summit must be achieved as quickly as possible, and that is to improve the competitiveness of the European economy. In this context the Ciampi Group also mentions the European company statute. It puts the loss to the economy of not having a statute of this kind at EUR 30 billion a year. We do not want the basic unrefined European company model. We need this European company to come supplied with minimum standards of worker participation. Our social policy goal is not of course the basic unrefined model of the market economy either, but a social market economy built on the European model. We should also judge the success of the Lisbon Summit on the contribution it makes to achieving this goal. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, do you know how Archimedes expounded his theory of the lever? He would say, 'Give me a fulcrum and I will lift the world.' In Lisbon you will clearly be trying to lift the world or, in any case, our world, the world of Europe. As for the lever, you have described all the appropriate mechanisms in your exhilarating proposal, which is exciting in so many respects. That simply leaves the fulcrum. The fulcrum is provided by resources. You find yourself before a House some of whose Members can still remember what I will refer to as the 'White Paper' syndrome, which is to say the remarkable initiative instigated by Jacques Delors that was torn to shreds by the 'accountants' at ECOFIN. We would not want the same misfortune to befall you now, as the programme that you have presented to us is so exhilarating that it could energise Europe and provide it with the future alluded to by Mr Goebbels. Nevertheless, you will have to have the means at your disposal, means which, I fear, you are somewhat lacking at present. It is thus up to you to create them. The straitjacket of Agenda 2000 will not provide you with the requisite means. You will thus have to encourage your colleagues to see to it that the proposals you make to us are going to be financed. Just one example - and it is one of the mechanisms central to your proposals - is that of the information and knowledge society.	es
"The agreement with Macedonia should be seen as a door opening to the European Union, allowing this country to join, even though this will not be the case in the foreseeable future. In the meantime, we constantly need to start from the premise in our policy that it is desirable for Macedonian legislation to resemble that of the Member States, and our policy should reflect this, even in the naming of aid programmes for Macedonia. I would quote the PHARE programme as an example. Mr President, the name of the republic is still a problem on account of the Greek sensitivities surrounding it. I assume that the Member States will feel increasingly freer to use the name in their own language which fits the republic. If certain countries wish to use the words ""former Yugoslavia"" , then that is their business; others need not feel obliged to copy them. It will not do to keep us under constant pressure. Hence my support for the sound report by Mr Swoboda; we have come to expect nothing less of him, and hence also my words of appreciation for the respected Republic of Macedonia. Mr President, let me begin by expressing my personal appreciation of the quality of Mr Swoboda' s work as rapporteur. Today we are expressing a positive opinion on the opening of negotiations for a stabilisation and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia. We do so in the awareness that this decision, the very first relating to that area, is actually set in the context of an entirely new phase of our relations with the Balkans. This new phase, or rather policy, identifies the prospect of integrating the region into Europe as the only option for settling its conflicts peacefully. Our agreement to the negotiations, as set out in the rapporteur' s explanatory statement, is born of the conviction that it is right for Union policy to combine both a regional dimension and a more precise assessment of efforts made and results achieved by individual countries in moving towards the acquis communautaire. This is the dual objective which I believe should be pursued. On the one hand, we must maintain programmes on, for example, infrastructure, preparations - still premature - for free trade, and encouragement of economic and commercial cooperation between the countries in the area, and on the other, it is now appropriate to create a model of closer integration with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as an example of the policy. And there are several reasons why our opinion can only be positive. As we were able to ascertain during our missions to Skopje, there has been considerable progress in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, as regards the economy, movement towards democracy and - an area which is difficult and contentious enough in the Balkans - multi-ethnic coexistence. On the other hand, the price Macedonia has been paying for the war in neighbouring Kosovo is very high, both in terms of logistic availability of NATO forces and in terms of reduced exports to Northern Europe."	fr
In this context, the criteria by which these rights are to be chosen must be clearly indicated. The essential criterion is the rights of citizens with regard to the European institutions, as contained in the European project enshrined in the Treaties of the European Union. I understand your concern about the rights of children. Many elements of our work, and particularly of my work as Commissioner for Justice and Home Affairs, involve protecting the rights of children. This is an area in which the principle of subsidiarity applies fully. Each Member State is principally responsible for defining its responsibilities towards children. As for the EU' s responsibility, the rights of children must be recognised in the Charter according to the areas in which the Union can give added value to the promotion of the social and economic situation and even the citizenship, in its broadest sense, of children. I hope we can meet the challenge which the honourable Member has posed for the Commission and the whole Convention. Mr President, I have had the privilege of hearing the Commissioner a number of times on this issue and I very much agree with his approach. However, I should like to ask a slightly different question. We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that he is anxious to communicate better with the people and to aim the information policy of the Commission towards the major issues that the Community is dealing with this year. Would the Commissioner argue for some of the information budget of the Commission to be put towards informing and consulting the citizens on this issue of a Citizens Charter? It is very important that the people feel engaged in this process. I know that the Convention itself will do much in this area but it does not have the resources that the Commission has. Will the Commission look at using its information budget to ensure people are engaged in this debate? It is the policy of the Commission to promote an open and wide debate on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non-governmental organisations but also with the citizens in a project as far-reaching as the Charter is. I can assure you that the Commission will do its best to promote the debate on the future Charter of Fundamental Rights. We can achieve the best of both worlds by having a clear text, a text that can be easily read by the citizens, and at the same time a text that can be used as a legal instrument. There is no contradiction between the two. The challenge we have is to bring them together in the final version of the Charter. I am very glad to know that I can count on your support here. Question No 40 by (H-0095/00): Subject: Articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on European Union Article 6.1 of the Treaty states that the Union is based on principles of liberty, democracy, respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It is clear from statements over the past years that Jörg Haider and the Freedom Party do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms with respect to third country nationals and minority groups living in Austria.	de
This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies. I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows. My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement. Granted this, the new Intergovernmental Conference must not fail to include in its agenda issues which, properly addressed, would ensure the correct operation of all and not just some of the European Union' s institutions. Just as it also must not fail to include everyday issues which, for that very reason, are highly visible to the European public. In its numerous debates and its reports so far the European Parliament has openly supported the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference. At the same time, however, I am asking for it to include issues that improve and complement the reform, I repeat, of all the institutional bodies as well as issues that are of direct concern and interest to the European public such as health, energy, culture, transport and even tourism. Whether or not the agenda will ultimately be widened is still the subject of debate and on this point I would like to extol the political conduct of the Portuguese Presidency, which has repeatedly made a commitment to the European Parliament to make the necessary efforts towards that end. All the same, whether or not more issues will be considered must in no way diminish the importance attributed by every Member State to the Intergovernmental Conference. This is because the institutional framework within which Europe will operate in the future is a foundation of European integration and is therefore a matter of the greatest national importance for every one of the Union' s Member States. In light of what I have said, I ask Parliament to approve the opinion which Mr Leinen and I have put before you, so that on 14 February, the work of the Intergovernmental Conference can begin and our two representatives, Mr Brok and Mr Tsatsos, can proceed with the difficult task that awaits them with the European Parliament' s backing. The same applies to the Commission and I would again like to thank Commissioner Barnier for his collaboration with the European Parliament and for the very constructive proposals he put before us. Mr President, the Group of the European People' s Party was not satisfied with the conclusions of the European Council in Helsinki. It seemed to us that the agenda lacked content, because our group was thinking in terms of the Treaty and, specifically, the protocol on the Union' s institutions. In Helsinki, the governments approved the idea that, as long as the European Union consists of fewer than 21 States, a minimal reform would be sufficient. With more than 21, a deeper reform would become necessary. The European Council in Helsinki itself approved enlargement involving 13 new Member States. It is therefore inconsistent to open accession negotiations with 13 countries while contemplating a minimal reform. We are therefore thinking in terms of the Treaty and we want the agenda of the next Intergovernmental Conference to allow for a deeper reform of the Union.	de
Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe? The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned. The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products. Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States. It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States. For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom. That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom. The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax. The Commission has no means of influence here. In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol. Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol. There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand. I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect. My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further. Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle. For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States. May I assure Mr MacCormick and other Members of this Parliament that the present situation where excise taxes differ between Member States is indeed something which is not conducive to the proper functioning of the internal market. We need not restrict ourselves to alcoholic products. If one looks at petrol, for example, one sees that excise taxes in Germany are different from those of Holland, and consequently Dutch motorists cross the border and fill up their tanks in Germany. That is indeed distortion of the internal market.	it
It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased. The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia. Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected. Living examples of this have been the Pinochet-Ugarten case, Kosovo and, in milder form in our own Union, the debate surrounding the government decision in Austria. This is what is at stake now in Cambodia unless the leaders of the previous oppressive regime are bought to justice. At the same time, the struggle against impunity is under threat. The situation should also remind us all that the ratification of the Treaty for an International Criminal Court has been shamefully slow. . Mr President, we had an extremely useful debate on human rights yesterday. I am pleased that we have had this further opportunity to consider a number of areas in the world - Kosovo, Angola, Chechnya and Cambodia - where the protection of human rights has been a particularly severe challenge. First of all, on Kosovo, the Commission fully shares the concerns expressed in these draft resolutions as regards general policy towards Kosovo, as regards the continuing ethnic violence and as regards the prisoners in Serb jails. Our efforts in Kosovo, as elsewhere in the wider region, are directed at short and medium-term recovery and long-term stabilisation. In particular we support the development of a free, democratic and multi-ethnic society. Our assistance programmes in the fields of democratisation and human rights should continue to build confidence in general and, in particular, to try to build confidence between the various communities. We have always condemned ethnic violence, no matter which ethnic group is the perpetrator or the victim. We consider it is unacceptable against Serb and Roma minorities as it was against the Kosovar Albanians in the past. We support the efforts of UNMIK, KFOR and the OSCE to establish a functioning civil administration and to ensure law and order. In this regard we strongly support the High Representative' s recent appeal to Member States to provide more police officers for the UN civil police mission in Kosovo. It was a point raised by several speakers in the debate. I hope it will underline the importance, when we address the development of a Common Foreign and Security Policy, of looking at the non-military aspects of that policy as well as the military aspects. It is just as important to have headline goals for our policing and institution building as for a military capacity. We continue to be very concerned about the many civilians who are presently held in Serb prisons.	de
My reply is perhaps not satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the honourable Member that the Commission will take that decision within a matter of weeks. I ask for the Member's understanding for this small delay in the Commission's decision. Commissioner, do you have any reason, on public health grounds, for a difference in the taxation rates on, for example, Scotch whisky or French Bordeaux wine or even my colleague's Bavarian beer? Can you envisage applying an alcohol - equivalent basis for taxation in Europe? The matter of excise taxes, to which the honourable Member is referring, is the prerogative of the Member State concerned. The Commission has no instruments to enforce any particular decrease or increase in excise taxes on alcoholic products or on any other products. Towards the end of this year the Commission will submit a report on the differences in excise taxes between Member States. It will no doubt engage in a discussion both with Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which indicates that there are quite a lot of differences in excise rates between Member States. For example - I believe the honourable Member referred to this - no excise taxes are applied on wine in France, whereas they are applied in the United Kingdom. That leads to a distortion of the internal market because wine is smuggled from France to the United Kingdom. The question specifically refers to the relation between excise taxes and the alcohol content of the goods subject to excise tax. The Commission has no means of influence here. In the case of Sweden, the instrument of excise taxes is indeed used to reduce the consumption of alcohol. Although this leads to a disparity in excise taxes between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that by itself increases cross-border smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to decrease the consumption of alcohol. There is ,of course, elasticity of demand, in this case a price elasticity of demand. I am not sure exactly what it is, but it is not zero, therefore it must have some effect. My question would have been almost exactly the one raised by Mr Purvis, but I would like to press the point further. Granted, as you say, that excise duties lie within the prerogative of Member States, nevertheless the use of that prerogative in a way which is unfairly discriminatory against producers in one part of the Community versus others might still conflict with the single market principle. For example, if we take what Mr Purvis and I would be thinking of, the malt whisky producing parts of the Highlands - a very peripheral part of Europe, very hard-pressed, a whole farming community as well as a distilling community dependent upon it - a general practice of taxing the alcohol in Scotch whisky, Dutch gin or Danish aquavit more than the alcohol in beer or the alcohol in wine, seems to me to be discriminatory and a discriminatory use of something which is admittedly within the prerogative of the Member States.	es
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin. I have already appeared before the French Senate. Therefore, throughout this debate, whenever I can, I will go directly to see the national parliaments too. With regard to the dialogue with our citizens, it is not a question of propaganda or marketing, nor even of communication. I want this dialogue to be a real dialogue. So, after a short film objectively explaining the challenges of institutional reform, those in the public gallery can participate in an open discussion. I will say again that we are going to conduct this dialogue initiative through specific cooperation or a more structured partnership with the Member States. I sincerely hope, with your support, that the governments of the Fifteen will participate in this dialogue initiative in the manner which they consider most appropriate. Mr President, I should like to join Mr Barnier' s study group with the 700 trainees so that he has some people to discuss matters with. It is not much fun, of course, having to discuss transparency and intergovernmental conferences with yourself. In connection with the Intergovernmental Conference, Mr Barnier said, during his presentation in Parliament, that social policy was not to be subject to majority decision-making but, when I look at page 63, I see that rights of travel and of residence - that is to say, the Residence Directives - ,combating discrimination, the whole of social security and the renewal of Regulation No 1408 and, with a few exceptions, of arrangements in the socio-political sphere are to be subject to qualified majority voting. Is not Mr Barnier nervous about penetrating the inner workings of the Member States' election processes? It is, of course, these issues which people go to the polls about and which lead to new majorities in the Folketing and other parliaments. Can such matters be controlled from Brussels? Is this an element in the radical decentralisation which Mr Prodi talked about this morning? I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities. I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears. Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms. Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki? I do not think so. Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking?	es
Lastly, the recommendations also incorporated an updated version of the proposals in President Delors' White Paper on the promotion of a European project for the development of a common network of infrastructures and services. These recommendations, which, for the most part, are consistent with the guidelines in the Portuguese presidency' s work programme and which will therefore be discussed at the Lisbon Summit, have been rejected or distorted by the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs of this Parliament, by a majority which only managed to achieve a fragile unity in its rejection of the idea of a European Union which is founded on the convergence of national policies and not just on the grouping together of markets. Mr President, this Parliament, which has shown itself to be highly Europeanist so many times, must, on this occasion, show that it can express a majority vote for a political union of Europe which is capable of dealing with market weak spots and failures. Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report is exciting. In its original form, it points the way towards a renewed economic policy which aims at something more than merely tightening up and balancing the economy. Now, finally, the EU' s position is, of course, such that we can achieve high growth and seriously take up the fight against unemployment without jeopardising objectives such as price stability and a balanced budget. It is therefore sad that, in committee, the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats and the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party should have voted down the proposals which take the fight against unemployment seriously. The debate and vote here in plenary ought to correct this. It is nonetheless gratifying that we should have united behind some of the strategically important proposals, namely that the Union' s economic policy ought to prioritise investments, partly in order to involve all the Union' s citizens in the information society, something which can also be of major significance from an economic point of view. I am also thinking of the importance of strengthening the applicant States' links with trans-European networks in the shape of both physical forms of transport and IT infrastructure. This is important for growth but also in order to avoid gulfs developing between people, both within the EU and between the EU and the applicant States. The applicant States ought not merely to tag along behind but, instead, share the EU' s ambition of becoming a world leader in the communications field. Society needs, therefore, to take responsibility for the rapid and vigorous expansion of a modern IT infrastructure which also reaches small companies, poor regions and ordinary citizens. We have that opportunity right now. Let us grasp it. Mr President, the advantage of speaking at the end of such a debate is that you can react to what has been said before. I would like to say that I strongly disagree with Mrs Villiers' view that this is such an interesting debate. I think that the European Parliament is doing itself absolutely no favours by thinking only in terms of old categories and churning out old political concepts and visions.	es
This was the only time I had spoken of my husband' s death but I must do so again today and I do it willingly. Madam President, I was born in Germany, educated in Sweden and married to a Spaniard. I know what democracy is because I had the good fortune to grow up in a country like Sweden which has a long democratic tradition. I arrived in the Basque Country keen to integrate and, despite what has happened to me, I am convinced that some day the Basque Country will achieve the peace it desires. To those who believe that there is conflict in the Basque Country, I would say that the only conflict in the Basque Country goes by the name of ETA and must be eliminated. As for the other problems, we can talk about these. (Loud and sustained applause) We democrats can solve the other problems by allowing everyone to put forward their ideas, because freedom of expression, free elections and freedom in general do exist in the Basque Country. The only restriction on this freedom is ETA which must therefore be eliminated. Then we democrats can talk. (Loud applause) Thank you, Mrs Dührkop Dührkop, I should like to assure you of my empathy and sincere respect. Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting The Minutes of the previous sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? We are about to discuss the subject of reforming the Commission and you will recall, Madam President, that at the beginning of the last session, I raised with you the question of whether, in the interests of openness and transparency, the Members' register of interests could be made more available to the public by being published on the Internet. You promised Parliament you would raise this subject with the Quaestors that very evening. I wonder if you are now in a position to confirm to Parliament that the Quaestors have agreed in principle that the register should be published on the Internet and, if so, whether you will personally set them a deadline - perhaps 1 April - for doing so. I can tell you, Mr Davies, that the Bureau has adopted the principle of publishing the Members' register of financial interests on the Internet and the Quaestors are studying in great detail the problems and the legal questions that it may involve. But we shall have a decision very soon. (The Minutes were adopted) Reforming the Commission The next item is the Commission statement on Reforming the European Commission. I shall give the floor straight away to the President, Mr Romano Prodi. - (IT) Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, last July, here in your presence, I made a solemn commitment to reform the Commission. I would just like to take a moment to recall the events of last July: the outgoing Commission had been in crisis, I had just been nominated and you gave your preliminary approval of that nomination. The climax of the chain of events was my undertaking to reform the Commission, to reform it thoroughly, completely revolutionising the Commission' s way of working.	es
With this, we believe that we are totally in line with what we agreed. I am simply asking the Commission to come and inform the Committee on Budgets before implementing the second tranche. I agree, absolutely. We shall do so. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. ALTENER The next item is the report (A5-0011/2000) by Mr Langen, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision adopting a multiannual programme for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the Community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370(COD)) Mr President, I would like to thank Mr Langen - although he is not actually here - for the work he has done to carry through the programme both in Parliament and in the Council. The project has been long and problematic. In future too, there will be a need to invest heavily in research into the use of renewable energy sources. Although there is much that is good about the new directive, it is nonetheless not without its defects. One example is the use of peat. Peat cannot be classified as belonging in the same group as fossil fuels. If peat cannot be classified directly as a renewable, non-fossil energy source, it must form its own class, especially as far as the issue of environmental taxation is concerned. It is not right that peat should be judged according to the same criteria as, for example, coal. The development of renewable energy sources is a partial solution to ending the Union' s dependence on imported energy. Research is particularly essential with regard also to the EU' s next round of enlargement. Dependence on imported energy affects worst of all many Eastern European countries, whose economic structure is still suffering from the dependence created in the times of the Soviet Union on Russian energy. The EU must adhere to the Kyoto Protocol on climate. We are all concerned about the environment and our children' s future. The share that renewable energy sources have in total energy production must be increased, but it has to be done in a rational manner. We have to remember that our basic energy production cannot be based on renewables for a long time to come. For that we need a form of energy production that does not harm the climate: nuclear energy. Mr President, on behalf of the PSE Group, I welcome the fact that we have reached an end result in the conciliation procedure for the ALTENER II Programme. Firstly, however, I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur, Mr Langen, for the truly excellent work he has done on this report. I would also like to thank the leader of the delegation in the Conciliation Committee, Mr Provan. For as Mr Langen said just now, we certainly had a tough fight on our hands in the Conciliation Committee. However, we can see today that the conciliation end result quite clearly bears the trademark of the European Parliament throughout.	es
Perhaps before we criticise anybody outside this place we should take a good look at ourselves and what we do here. Mr President, I will not use my speaking time by going into the individual cases debated here today. In this respect, I share Mrs Plooij-Van Gorsel' s view that we cannot talk about these in detail. But maybe next time, we ought to discuss CORUS, the merger which has now taken place between our Nederlandse Hoogovens and British Steel. I would like to place this discussion in a somewhat wider context and examine the link between policy in the field of company mergers within the European Union and policy in other fields. In this light, I am pleased that Mr Liikanen is present and we do not only have to hold this discussion, where the interests of employees are concerned, with Mrs Diamantopoulou but we can involve the Commissioners who are active in other fields. I would also like to advocate coherence in the Commission' s policy from these different vantage points, unlike my predecessor, who holds the belief that there is no need for rules. We need to gain an insight into what companies are like now. At present, we are witnessing a number of large mergers between companies which originate in an Anglo-Saxon tradition and companies with a Rhineland tradition. What remains of the concept of what a company should be like now is naturally very relevant: whether it is merely the property and toy of shareholders, or whether it is a more broadly based stakeholder society, which is meant to guarantee continuity for staff, consumers, suppliers and the local population and has, in addition, a social function. As such, I would like to ask these various Commission directorates and these various Commissioners to provide a wider vision regarding corporate governments. I think that it would also fit in well with the plans which have been presented over the past couple of days on good government in Europe, as company policy forms part of this. The government is talking to trade union and Goodyear delegates in Italy as well, in an endeavour to find a solution to the closure policy unilaterally adopted by the North American multinational in Cisterna di Latina, an area of Central Italy which has already been affected by other restructuring operations. The closure means the direct or indirect loss of more than a thousand jobs and hundreds of families being abandoned to insecurity and sudden poverty. The Goodyear workers are putting up a magnificent fight, in the knowledge that they are defending not only their own interests but the interests of the Goodyear workers in the different European countries as well, and there are many of them: France, Germany, the United Kingdom, Poland, Luxembourg and Slovenia. Today, a small delegation of workers is here with us in the gallery, anxious to find out what their future will be, what solidarity the European Union will offer them and what policy it will adopt to prevent the multinationals acting solely and exclusively in the interest of their own market and profits. The European Union, in all of its aspects, must use all of its powers to resolve this and other disputes.	it
That concludes Questions to the Commission. (The sitting was suspended at 7.30 p.m. and resumed at 9.00 p.m.) Community policy in the field of water (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy. Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease. To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East. In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia. I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area. I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin. The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions. I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent. However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations. I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain. The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today. Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions. In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources. It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests. We also reject the amendments which aim to incorporate the integral cost of water for 2010. We must clearly set water prices which promote its efficient use but which, at the same time, safeguard the competitivity of the producing industries in the less-favoured regions and do not hinder their legitimate development.	fr
Will you be adding that into your audit progress committee' s work? Finally, the Socialist Group agrees with activity-based budgeting and with responsibilisation and you will be judged, as Mr Prodi says, by your actions, not your words. That concludes Question Time. I should like to thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock. Statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy The next item is the statement by the High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy. Please give a very warm welcome to Mr Javier Solana to whom I shall hand over without further delay. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, it is a great pleasure for me to appear before you again, here in the European Parliament. Much has happened since the last time I was here to talk about foreign and security policy issues in our continent. Sometimes we may feel that too much has happened. This afternoon I should like to share with you some ideas, particularly on the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The world has certainly moved on significantly in recent months and many events have occurred. However, I will wait for question time to give specific answers to any questions you may have for me. In recent months, since the last time I appeared before you, important events have occurred in this House and also in the European Union. I would remind you of two of these events, one of which is very dear to you all as members of this Parliament, and particularly to the President. These are the opening of the Intergovernmental Conference and the starting of negotiations with the future members of the European Union. The events in Kosovo and the Balkans in general have certainly stirred our hearts and minds. There are also important issues at stake in the Middle East in which the President of this House played a major role on her recent trip. Certain important steps have been taken to secure progress in the summit between Europe and Africa in which I was pleased to participate in cooperation with the Portuguese presidency. A vital meeting has also taken place in Portugal, in Vilamoura, with the eighteen countries of Latin America to try and develop a deeper relationship between the European Union and Latin America. Chechnya has also been one of our main concerns and I will speak briefly on this at the end, in the light of an important conversation which I had this morning with the Council of Europe representative, Mr Álvaro Gil-Robles, on his recent visit to the region. However, I realise that you asked me here to talk to you more specifically about foreign policy and particularly security policy in Europe since Helsinki. I will speak of this briefly. If you wish to ask questions at the appropriate time, I will be pleased to answer them. The Helsinki Summit under the Finnish presidency took place a little over two months ago. Decisions were taken at this summit which are fundamental for foreign and security policy in our continent.	es
Although it is laudable from an economic point of view to make structural changes in order to be more competitive and win market shares, this approach may be reprehensible if it is made at the request of financiers, often shareholders, with the sole unavowed aim of increasing the financial standing of the company in order to raise profits which they can then withdraw from the company. The various recent announcements referred to by previous speakers, be they by Michelin or Goodyear, are symptomatic in this respect. Rationalised management and improved profits should, in my view, serve the company and hence its employees first and foremost, and any financial benefits should follow. However, what we witnessing today is the phenomenon of concentration and corporate regrouping and relocation, with all the familiar consequences, both on the quality of products and at the social level, especially in terms of unemployment, difficult working conditions and increased flexibility: consequences which have a drastic effect at the human level, especially on the family unit. There is a very real risk of seeing a two-headed monster emerge on this planet, with poor countries providing the labour and rich countries providing the capital. Surely Europe should act as a safeguard, maintaining a certain equilibrium between increased profitability and social welfare? We must not forget that it is human resources which make a company function at its base and guarantee it good results. Finally, allow me to remind you that the third letter of the EDD Group to which I belong stands for 'difference' . Europe has a duty to make its voice heard as an alternative to savage restructuring for profit at all costs. Without doubt, the voice of difference in this monotonous flood of restructuring. Mr President, last month in the UK, in a region that neighbours mine, the Michelin Group announced significant redundancies at its Stoke-on-Trent plant due to company restructuring and increasing global competitiveness in the world market for tyres. I, like all Members present, am saddened by this loss of jobs. Equally, I am saddened by the announcement made by Goodyear that has prompted this resolution. But I doubt very much indeed whether a European works council would have been able to change this company' s decision. This House is very good at producing resolutions and legislation and we sometimes, in this institution, forget that Europe cannot survive alone. We need multinational companies to base their businesses within our continent. In my few months here, I have found it astonishing that whilst we all talk about the need to encourage businesses to grow within the EU, nearly every resolution we pass actually encourages businesses to leave. In our last plenary part-session in Brussels we voted on the end-of-life vehicles directive and managed to make the legislation retrospective, adding huge costs for the European motor manufacturers that they could not have predicted. Two days later, Toyota, which employs several thousand people in my region, stated that this directive would not only increase the cost of cars but could well also mean redundancies in their Derbyshire plant. In a world where surely less regulation is the key, we in this House seem to believe that we can add more regulation and costs on business and that they will stay within the European Union, untempted by other locations elsewhere where there are fewer burdens.	de
The result is 30% growth, so we are not completely dissatisfied with the result. Of course, it is always better to make more funding available more quickly - and I for one will always advocate this - but I do think that this programme opens up good opportunities for quite a few programmes. I would like to stress that culture is not only funded from this particular pot. Culture does not only fall under the banner of culture but also under that of all kinds of other areas. A great deal of money for culture is also set aside in the Structural Funds, and this is something which we should definitely consider and bear in mind. Fortunately, I am on the Committee on Regional Policy. So I myself will make sure that this aspect receives due attention. I think that we have also opted in favour of allowing the budget to be of an adequate size because, if it happens to be cancelled, then surely this does not benefit the citizen. I have always given the rapporteur my backing in this respect. However, I do think that it is necessary, as he always states too, that, in the next IGC, changes will be made to codecision, when unanimity will no longer be necessary. We are very positive about the many improvements which have been made: no more mega-projects, room for cultural networks, and sufficient attention to promoting reading, translating and translation companies. This is especially important to smaller linguistic areas. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur and also Mrs Reding for Culture 2000. All that remains for me to say is: time to get down to business. Madam President, all that I wanted to say has been covered by those fellow Members who spoke before me and I think there is unanimity among the groups in the European Parliament and among those of us on the Committee on Culture. I too must say that I will be voting for this joint text for a Council and European Parliament decision with a very heavy heart. Not because our delegation, our rapporteur and the chairman Mr Gargani did not work exceptionally well - they worked very hard indeed - and not because I have any strong objection to Commissioner Reding' s attitude - I think that, given the framework she was operating in, her attitude was particularly positive - but because of the negative and unacceptable position adopted by the Council. It is shameful! That figure of EUR 167 million for so many years is a disgrace for the European Union! When we are compelled literally to humiliate theatre groups, young musicians, pioneering activities in the arts, writers, to humiliate them and send them packing with a slap on the back and thirty rejection slips in such a way that they begin to perceive Europe as something foreign, something opposed, contrary and hostile to any effort towards cultural creativity - an area in which the European Union should make its presence felt because our mission is not just the euro, not just enlargement, nor geostrategic expedients, but also to encourage culture to flower in this affair of European Unification - then this is indeed a sorry way to end. So long as we continue to have unanimity, so long as yesterday the Dutch Government was able to impose those EUR 167 million as an ultimatum and so long as a government with Mr Haider will soon be telling us what cultural activities we can pursue, we will never progress.	it
In many areas the parks which are a fundamental element in the LIFE programme have been established. But creating parks with very limited financial resources, without any system of signs is inefficient and ineffectual. I would therefore ask Parliament and the Commission to give the matter their full attention. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, ever since the beginning of 1999, discussions have taken place between the institutions on the subject of the proposed regulation for a third stage for the instrument for the environment known as LIFE. I would again thank the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy and Mrs Lienemann for the good and constructive co-operation we have had on this matter. As a result of this, I can confirm that the Commission wholly or in principle approves nine of the fourteen amendments which have been adopted by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The Commission welcomes, above all, Amendments Nos 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which apply to the Committee procedures. In these cases, Parliament has fully taken account of the objections which the Commission had to the common position. The Commission can, in principle, also approve Amendment No 4 which ought, however, to be introduced into another place in the text. With regard to Amendments Nos 5 and 6, I want to emphasise that projects for the sustainable exploitation of groundwater and surface water, together with projects for reducing forms of air pollution which contribute to the greenhouse effect, are to a large degree covered by LIFE. The Commission nonetheless considers that, if this is stated separately, then that is to go against the original decision to have the proposal focus on just a few priority areas. There is also a risk of overlap with other Community programmes such as the Fifth Framework Programme for Research, Technical Development and Demonstration. The present programme' s key measures - water quality, tomorrow' s city and innovative products and processes - to a certain degree cover the same questions. Where the question of the budget is concerned, I am pleased about the confidence shown by the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Amendment No 12 requires a larger budget than that stated in the common position. I am also convinced that LIFE has great potential. This instrument could finance good projects with a higher amount of money than that quoted in the proposed budget. The amount quoted in Amendment No 12 does not, however, tally with the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000. Allow me also to add that, if the budget is increased, greater demands are obviously going to be made upon the Directorate-General for the Environment if an increased number of projects are going to be dealt with. Account will also have to be taken of other programmes where decisions are to be made within the framework of the joint decision-making procedure. At this stage, the Commission is keeping to the amount which has been set in the common position. With regard to Amendment No 3, which we did not approve at first reading, I want to emphasise that each programme has its own objectives, conditions under which it may be applied for and costs which make it eligible for aid.	fr
It is true in regard to guaranteeing the free movement of labour without loss of social entitlements. It applies to the fact of our having to coordinate our economies; and it applies in the case of economic cooperation. So coordination and cooperation are facts of life. But convergence should be about goals, not means. I should also like to thank the rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his report and for his very constructive contribution to the attempt to reconcile different positions and to secure support for his report. I can support the report, but there are a few points which are not completely to my taste. I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission should intervene in regard to what is referred to as unfair competition between social and tax systems, if interference of this kind is to be used to stem the tide of new thinking and to restrict development and the process of making our social systems more efficient, or else to prevent a reduction in the unduly high tax burden in many EU countries. I am sceptical about the detailed regulations that might result from the Commission' s having to deal with the scope and quality of child care and care of the elderly, and I am sceptical about the value of a common poverty threshold. Dialogue and the coordination of social policy are to be commended, but we should not lump all nations together as if they were the same. There should be room for a multiplicity of solutions. Mr President, Commissioner, with regard to the strategy which has been set out here on modernising social security, I would like to point out some positive things as well as raise some questions that have come up for me. I feel positive about the movement which is very gradually taking place in the dossier. This seems to be a good thing and useful. I also feel positive about the essence of the communication, namely the strategic approach. We therefore hope that the four objectives which are mentioned in it can reasonably be achieved. We would also underline the importance of the way in which the strategy is handled. On the one hand, it would be useful to have guidelines and a process styled on Luxembourg, but we also think it is important, as is already mentioned by Mrs Van Lancker, that guidelines are drafted to accommodate less typical work scenarios, such as sole traders, etc. We nonetheless foresee two problems for which solutions will need to be found. The first problem is that concerning the downward adjustment of social security, which, we hope, will be replaced by high-level convergence. I can illustrate this with examples from a study which was carried out recently by the Dutch trade union movement into social security reforms within the European Union. It appears from this study that adjustments are rife but most of these adjustments, in fact, the majority of them, appear to be downward adjustments, the remainder being improvements. The lion' s share of these adjustments pertains to pension plans: eleven restrictions and two improvements. In the case of unemployment benefits, we came across six restrictions and five improvements. The reasons for adjustments are, for example, to improve employment, reduce social security expenditure, but are also due to policy competition and EMU criteria. Policy competition mainly occurs in the northern countries. The highest level of stability and even improvement of social security can be found in the southern countries. All in all, both sides of industry only have a limited role to play in the process as a whole. This is nothing to write home about and means that the convergence strategy must focus on the best approaches. To use a figure of speech, cappuccino is not always good for us.  Mr President, I would, in turn, like to congratulate both the Commission, for making another step in the convergence process with regard to social security, and the rapporteur for the sound report he has compiled.	de
The only way to prevent these events happening again, in a place where there are large communities of immigrant workers, is through social integration. This requires a firm economic, political and social commitment from the competent authorities. We are all immigrants. For generations human beings have not always remained within the borders of one nation state but have constantly migrated. Geographical mobility is not an invention of the twentieth century and neither are its economic and work-related causes. We are all immigrants, if not ourselves personally, then through one of our relations or ancestors. However, instead of producing these events which we are condemning, migration must generate social, cultural and economic enrichment. What happened in El Ejido is unfortunately not exclusive to this one town of the European Union. We must therefore firstly condemn clearly and emphatically the brutal racist and xenophobic outbursts of certain inhabitants of El Ejido against immigrant workers in the area. A whole community should not have been held responsible, criminalised and attacked for one regrettable but isolated incident. Secondly, all the authorities must act immediately. Coordination between them is the key to combating this type of xenophobia and racism. In particular, local authorities and mayors have a direct responsibility to prevent any demonstration of racism or xenophobia, especially when this involves violent and aggressive acts against people and their property. These authorities must also help to achieve difficult agreements between the parties involved and must not hinder these, as has happened with the mayor in question. Thirdly, the political parties must assume direct responsibility for the political actions of their public officials. They must prevent any individual action or declaration which is contrary to the principles and values of coexistence and tolerance expressed by the European Union. Finally, the European Union must be responsible for monitoring the application of its principles. It must prevent any racist or xenophobic demonstrations in its territory and support and collaborate with national, regional and local authorities and non-governmental organisations and associations in the application of these principles. This must occur within a framework of constant action to combat racism and xenophobia and to encourage the integration of all immigrants resident in the EU. Mr President, initially our Group did not fully understand the need to table this motion for a resolution on events which seemed to be a local phenomenon. However, the incidents in El Ejido are a symptom of a phenomenon which is present throughout Europe and which deserves our full attention. We thought we had eradicated the terror of intolerance which racism had unleashed in Europe. Yet, over the years, social disintegration in Europe has been combining with an increase in migration from surrounding countries and increased awareness of human rights to develop into this climate of racism and intolerance. This is why what seemed to be a local and isolated phenomenon in El Ejido is actually a worrying symptom which is coinciding with the emergence of parties like Haider' s. This House therefore proposes the adoption of urgent measures encompassing all the relevant factors and to be applied immediately. We must ensure respect for human rights, tolerance and multiculturalism and we must obtain an increase in budgets and action lines for social and health issues.	fr
The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99. I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented. We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety. Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future. What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used. We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency. Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you. The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244. Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region. It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos. Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo? If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania? Since the author is not present, Question No 7 lapses. Question No 8 by (H-0796/99): Subject: New INTERREG Initiative In point 1 of Annex 2 to its draft Communication on INTERREG entitled: Promotion of urban, rural and coastal development, the Commission authorises for the renovation and development of historic urban centres using a joint cross-border strategy. However, housing is specifically excluded. Given the fact that there are many houses in rural areas which are of historic interest, including small cottages, and, given the need, for a variety of reasons, to maintain rural populations and to attract people to rural areas, does not the Council agree that these objectives could be assisted if housing projects were funded in the areas covered by INTERREG? Mr President, the Council and, I think, the Portuguese Presidency in particular, are extremely aware of the importance of the problems Mr Gallagher' s question raises and I would like to say that we have always paid the utmost attention to Community policies for the development of rural areas.	es
It has been shown, as we have been claiming since 1995, that this move is appalling, and, if Portugal and France wish to reach an agreement, that is fine by us, but these anchovies should be fished in Portuguese fishing grounds and not in the Bay of Biscay. Today, scientific studies show that the anchovy population in the Bay of Biscay is in danger of extinction, and now there will be measures to restrict the amount of anchovy which can be fished in that Bay. I do not know if you are aware, representatives of the Council of Ministers, of your responsibility over these last few years, and in 2000 as well, for the plight of the families who live on anchovy fishing in the north of the Iberian Peninsular. I would like to say, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, that in its judgement of 5 October 1999, the European Court of Justice ruled that this transfer, which was approved, was in accordance with the principles laid down in Council Regulation 37/60/92 and, specifically, with its Article 9(1), which stipulates that Member States may exchange all or part of the fishing rights that they have been allocated. The Court also stated that the principle of relative stability had not been violated since the anchovy quota allocated to Spain in zone VIII had been maintained at 90% and France' s at 10%. Apart from this, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Court is of the opinion that the transfer effected between Portugal and France does not violate the principle of exploiting living sea and freshwater resources in a rational and responsible way, on the grounds that the fishing pressure in zones VIII and IX neither increases nor adversely affects the overall quota of these resources allocated to Spain. Accordingly, Mr Ortuondo Larrea, the Council reiterates its opinion that without this transfer, greater account would be taken of France' s possibilities for anchovy fishing in the Bay of Biscay. The Council therefore reiterates its opinion that fishing pressure would be greater and more damaging to population numbers than the solution which was eventually chosen. In concrete terms, 3 000 tonnes represent 57.5% of Portugal' s fishing opportunities in 2000 against 5 008 tonnes or 73.9% in 1999. These numbers represent, in our opinion and in the opinion of the Council, a real improvement in terms of conservation in comparison with the level of 80% laid down in Council Regulation 685/95. Question No 6 by (H-0788/99): Subject: Measures to combat the continuing ethnic cleansing of Serbs and Romanies in Kosovo On 2 December 1999, NATO's Defence Ministers made a strong appeal for an end to the ethnic cleansing of Kosovo's minority communities. In its resolution referring to specific atrocities committed against Serbs and Romanies, Parliament also vigorously condemns the continuing violence against the Serb population and calls on the leaders of the Kosovo Albanians to fully respect UN Resolution 1244. The resolution also stresses that previous persecution of the Albanians cannot constitute a pretext for killings, abductions, detentions, intimidation, arson, looting, destruction of property and the taking-over of houses etc.	it
Mr Désir, I note your comment and the existence of this joint motion for a resolution. If the services of the Presidency confirm that this was correctly tabled, it will be included. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. (The sitting was closed at 8.14 p.m.) Adoption of the Minutes of the previous sitting Mr President, I simply wanted to pass on some news. There was a terrorist attack this morning in Madrid. Someone planted a car bomb and one person has died. On behalf of my Group, I once again condemn these terrorist acts. Thank you, Mrs Fraga Estévez. We had heard about this regrettable incident. Unfortunately, the terrorist murderers are once again punishing Spanish society. I note your comments with particular keenness, as you may expect, given that I too am Spanish. (The Minutes were approved) Resumption of the session I declare resumed the session of the European Parliament adjourned on Friday, 21 January 2000. Madam President, allow me to remind you that tomorrow will be the second anniversary of the Cermis tragedy. Two years ago, in Cavalese in Italy, an American aeroplane from the Aviano NATO base cut through the cables of a cable car during a low-flying exercise which exceeded safe limits, causing the deaths of more than 20 Europeans. Since then, the victims' families, who have not had the consolation of justice, since the pilot responsible has not faced criminal charges, have been awaiting solicitous financial compensation from the United States at the very least. I therefore appeal to the President of this House and the President of the Commission for them to stand surety for immediate compensation from the U.S. authorities, and this is in order to uphold the rights of the victims' families. Mrs Angelilli, thank you. I have taken note of your comment. Agenda Madam President, I would like to express my support for the decision of the Conference of Presidents, and, since I publicly criticised the presidency in January, I would like to take this opportunity to say, both for myself and on behalf of the Socialist Group, that we now find the presidency' s statements on this issue to be appropriate, and we agree on their basis, their importance and their form. Madam President, it would really be very difficult to imagine a debate which is more in accordance with Rule 50 of our Rules of Procedure. This debate is topical, exceptionally important and urgent. We therefore believe that the agenda should be amended to include it. (Applause) Is there anyone who wishes to speak against this proposal? Madam President, I shall speak against this proposal on the grounds of a principle which I consider absolutely vital with regard to observance of the Treaties, and with particular regard to Article 7 of the Treaty of Amsterdam. Madam President, until now we believed that the European Union was, according to the Treaty of Rome and the Treaty of Paris founding the European Communities, and subsequently the Union, an association of free, independent, sovereign states. Even though many developments cast doubt on this, we did believe, in spite of everything, that this was the case and, more recently, reference was made, albeit half-heartedly, to the principle of subsidiarity.	it
"You have made a bold start by rightly emphasising the need to focus on so-called ""core tasks"". That, as you have said yourself today, means that you must also identify tasks, policies and programmes which are peripheral or irrelevant to the Commission's main vocation. Many existing European Union policies and programmes may simply have passed their sell-by date, or have been proved unwieldy or ineffective when administered at European level. The challenge now is to have the courage to devolve as many non-core tasks as possible back to lower levels of national, regional and local government. If we are to succeed in persuading a sceptical European public of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are as active in the devolution of unwarranted EU powers as we are in the evolution of new EU powers. We must not allow the critics of European integration to claim, as they presently do with some justification as we have just heard from Mr Bonde, that the increase in EU responsibilities is a one-way street only. It must be shown to be a two-way process in which existing EU policies and programmes, which are not clearly justified on the grounds of subsidiarity and proportionality, are devolved and repealed. If you are able to match these aspirations with actions in the years ahead, you will be making an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole and, as we have heard today, you will enjoy widespread support in this European Parliament. Madam President, Mr Prodi, I fully support the thinking of the proposals made by my colleague, Mrs Hautala, on the Commission' s strategic objectives for the coming five years. I myself want to refer to a subject which has not been mentioned but which is on the agenda, namely the Commission' s work programme for 2000. I am aware of the limitations of the exercise given that we have to work within the current Treaty and are therefore restricted by its operational rules. I am thinking in this respect of the important issue of taxation which I am not, however, going to talk about. Rather, I want to start by welcoming certain proposals which you have made in this programme for 2000. These include all the proposals on food safety which are ambitious and important and those on maritime safety which are particularly important given the two oil slicks which have affected the coast of Brittany and Turkey. The Commission should react quickly in this respect. However, on other issues the proposals could be more ambitious and faster acting. I have some positive suggestions to make, particularly on the social area, the environment and the follow-up to Seattle. Firstly, you have said that the citizens of Europe must be reconciled with the institutions. This is self-evident and it is therefore essential to find out their main concerns. For example, in the social area, it is not enough to announce a communication on a programme of social action."	es
Not once does your twelve-page document mention the national parliaments even though they comprise the elected representatives of the people. Clearly, they have no role to play in your strategy. You dare not even call a spade a spade, but instead hide behind pseudo-trendy language by using the term 'governance' for what is nothing more than federal, autocratic, centralised government. Having tried for many years to persuade us by talking of shared sovereignty, you are now revealing your ultimate goal. You intend to trade in all European sovereignty, whether national or collective, for a world government in which you do not even expect to obtain a dominant position. Finally, you are daring to condemn and penalise the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians, or are allowing this to happen, just because the result does not suit you. Yet at the same time you are supporting Communist China and trading with countries which have openly violated human rights for decades. Members of this House are today speaking out against a telegram from Mr Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel which, quite obviously, is not a demonstration of sympathy but rather a political manoeuvre. Your sabre-rattling fools no one because, as you know perfectly well, whether you like it or not, you need Austria in order to reform the Treaties and harmonise savings tax. You will cynically and hypocritically use Austria as a convenient threat to further strip the Member States of any real powers in the construction of the European Union. Your Commissioners are clearly not solely responsible for this. The governments which, through spinelessness or ideology, support you are also responsible. Brussels is not all of us, as you claim. It is all of you. Tell the truth for once. You could not care less what the people of Europe want. They are free to choose only between your brave new world and denouncement. It is over ten years since the collapse of the Soviet Union and yet your projects contain a strong hint of the gulags and mollifying moralism. We were among the small number who denounced the communist dictatorship. We are and will remain among those fighting against Europeanist dictatorship. We call on all the people of Europe to resist your monstrous projects. The salvation of European democracies is with nation states. Europe' s salvation lies in the cooperation of the nations of Europe. (Limited applause) President Prodi, today you have presented the Commission' s five-year programme, and it has many objectives that we endorse. It is a programme based on real-life situations and issues, and it is therefore right to put concrete measures aside for the moment and focus on the major issues. In my view, Mr Prodi, judging from the text and the document that you had sent to us, one subject that is very important to both of us has been given secondary importance, and that is solidarity, not so much at international level as at internal level. The Archbishop of Milan, Monsignor Carlo Maria Martini, is calling upon all politicians, in particular those like you and me, President Prodi, for whom the cultural and historic principle behind their presence in politics is the principle of the active involvement of Catholics in politics, to reconsider a development process, which, in addition to economic profit, takes the marginalised and those left behind by society very much into account.	it
What we need to look out for in this context is how matters develop in connection with the harbours in Gaza, the northern transit route between Gaza and the West Bank, further releases of political prisoners and implementation of the financial commitments. The second point relates to Syria. There, the border question is obviously central. How negotiations are proceeding there, we still do not know. What is important, however, is that they have begun. An important question in this context is the future distribution of water. As things are at present, the Golan Heights account for between a third and a sixth of Israel's water supply. The third aspect is the peace negotiations in Syria which are closely linked to the issue of Israeli withdrawal from Southern Lebanon. According to UNIFIL, there are now concrete signs that Israel is preparing to withdraw, which is something we welcome. There too, of course, outstanding matters in dispute are the water problem and the situation of the Lebanese Palestinian refugees. My last point concerns the future Palestinian State. This may be proclaimed in the course of this year, with or without Israel' s support. The Barak government has given to understand that it intends to conclude a peace agreement with a state as the other party. Even if negotiations are not completed by September of this year, there is nothing in the relevant treaties to prevent a Palestinian state from being proclaimed after that date. In this context, it is important for those of us who support the idea of a Palestinian state that the latter should be as Commissioner Patten said, namely a state subject to public control, and that it should be a democratic state. This is something to which we all want to contribute. Mr President, I would like to refer, firstly and above all, to the joint resolution which will be laid down to round off this debate. My Group has made a contribution to this resolution and, needless to say, approves of it. More specifically, however, I would like to express our delight at the fact that, after such a long time, Israel and Syria are on speaking terms again to resolve their differences of opinion. The recent negotiations are already an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East. It is, therefore, regrettable that these peace talks have been suspended for the time being. Indeed, both parties will need to make huge efforts. Lasting peace in the region can only be achieved by means of an agreement which guarantees the security of the Israeli borders, as well as Syria' s integrity. It is also necessary to initiate permanent diplomatic relations and to establish constant dialogue. In addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria, I hope that Israel will also enter into negotiations with Lebanon within the foreseeable future and that, in the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach will appear possible. Nevertheless, it is still regrettable that the European Union, one of the most important financial donors, is still unable to play a major political role in the peace process. This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the European Union' s common foreign and security policy.	es
If this environmental dimension were not incorporated into the management of data, then the Commission would be able unilaterally, just as it pleases, to prohibit the use of any particular type of fishing gear. Amendment No 4 specifies the obligation upon scientists to process all the data and pass it on to the relevant authorities, including national and regional authorities, in order to contribute to the decision-making process. Amendment No 5 serves to mitigate the Commission proposal. Effectively, the information requested from the authorities must be reasonable in order to allow an operational overview of fishing activities without compromising essential rights to confidentiality, for example, in fiscal matters, where the Community has no jurisdiction. Amendment No 6 is intended to tighten up the Commission' s participation in the inspection procedure. It is essential that all the data is sent on an annual basis and that the Commission should produce regular reports of the aggregated results. Finally, Amendment No 7 requires the Commission to produce a report by the end of the year 2001. In fact, because the reform of the common fisheries policy is scheduled for 2002, it is essential that all the political participants should be given the opportunity to familiarise themselves with the information which will form the basis of the Commission proposal. Hudghton report (A5-0036/2000) - (FR) The amendment to the directive as presented by the Commission is an important one since it deals with a specific disease, i.e. infectious salmon anaemia, a contagious viral disease. It is a water-borne virus and is transmitted via organic substances such as blood, faecal matter, mucus, etc. There is no scientific proof of the possibility of vertical transmission of the disease through roe. It is, however, recognised that other species such as trout, eels or herring, may be carriers of the virus without being affected by it. The disease was detected in Norway in 1984 and also in Canada (1996). The virus does not survive at a temperature of more than 26º C, and is therefore not dangerous to humans. The disease chiefly affects the Scottish salmon industry. It was detected in this region in May 1998. Today, 240 salmon farms are affected by ISA. It is therefore essential to contain this disease and prevent it spreading to all the aquacultural establishments in the various Member Sates of the European Union. The Council proposal envisages setting up a system for the gradual elimination of fish affected by the disease and also a vaccination plan. We can only declare ourselves in favour of the proposed plan for the gradual elimination of affected fish. The fish farms concerned must be assisted in 'cleaning up' the infected site and preventing the disease from spreading through the commercial transport of live fish. As regards vaccination, we should remember that the initial directive prohibited the use of vaccines against ISA. The Commission' s new proposal would authorise the use of vaccines, but it is important to point out that so far, no vaccine has actually been found. The usefulness of this proposal is limited, to say the least, certainly in the short term. Canada does have a vaccine with a 76% success rate. Since the Canadian strain differs from the European strain, this vaccine cannot be used in its present state, but may be used as the starting point for the development of a vaccine against the European strain.	it
I do not think that forcing the systems to converge, aside from problems with the principle of subsidiarity, will achieve the results we are hoping for, because there will always be ways of getting around the system, ways which are harmful to the environment. Mr President, every day five million items of solid waste are thrown overboard from ships. This rubbish drifts across the seas and ends up on beaches, severely damaging the environment and marine life. As a result one million birds and a hundred thousand marine mammals and sea turtles are killed each year. The MARPOL Convention aims to prevent pollution from ships but legislation is clearly necessary to ensure the convention is enforced. That is why this directive is so important and why tonight I am pleased to welcome the progress that has been made in Council to reach a common position which will force ships to dispose of their waste at port reception facilities. I also commend the work of the rapporteur, whose commitment reflects the strength of feeling within our committee to tackling this particular problem and a strong desire amongst parliamentarians of all parties to call a halt to this environmentally disastrous practice. I particularly welcome his strong support for the proposal that, in the interests of improving pollution prevention and avoiding distortions of competition, the environmental requirements should apply to all ships irrespective of the flag they fly and adequate waste reception facilities be made available in all ports throughout the Community. An area where British Labour Members take issue with the rapporteur is the way in which the polluter-pays principle is to be applied. The principle is one we strongly support but we believe it can be more effectively enforced if Member States retain the power to establish their own charging systems appropriate to their own circumstances. For example, in the UK the system by which a ship pays the waste collector each time it uses waste facilities, without the port getting involved, works well. It is based on a consensus which has been forged by all the players, including the ports and environmental groups like RSPB and the World Wildlife Fund. However, we share the rapporteur's concern that different charging systems should not lead to greater risk of maritime pollution. That is why we back the Council proposal to strengthen the review clause to ensure the impact of the directive is monitored regularly. Mr President, anyone who has witnessed the environmental consequences of the Erika disaster cannot reasonably vote against a report, the aim of which is to ensure that ship-generated waste oil is taken care of. This is an extraordinarily important report. It should be emphasised, in this context, that it is not mainly legislation that is missing. All EU countries have signed the so-called MARPOL Convention, and the Baltic countries have also signed the Helsinki Convention. The aim of both is to prevent discharges into the sea. It is a question, rather, of increasing access to port reception facilities and of creating the motivation also to use these.	it
Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence. And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect. For these are prerequisite to any development. If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow. I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba. After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International. It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned. Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union. There is a second issue I would like to raise. We are discussing coherence here. Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent. In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too. There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another. Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, if in future you succeed in making this EUR 13.5 billion subject to the supervision of the parliamentary Committee on Budgetary Control, and to bodies such as OLAF, then I believe you will raise the level of acceptability. This, to my mind, is also something that we should call upon the Intergovernmental Conference to do, i.e. establish the EDF firmly in the budget of the European Union. Mr President, we certainly must concede that, on balance, this text is full of good intentions, but we did not vote in favour of it in committee, nor shall we do so in plenary. We had two reasons for this, both of which gave rise to amendments which I should like to explain here very briefly. First, the Committee on Development and Cooperation advocates the communitisation of the EDF; clearly that is misguided. In our view, cooperation is, and should remain, an intergovernmental exercise. With Europe preparing to enlarge, communitising the EDF would make it easy to hide a lack of commitment behind the screen of the Community budget, quite apart from the fact that we would be wasting a fruitful and promising opportunity of associating our southern partners with our cooperation policy. Lastly, the Commission has, in the recent past, had trouble managing the funds for development and humanitarian aid transparently, as Mrs Maes has just reminded us so opportunely.	es
Just when we thought the discussions had ended, a number of diverse amendments have been tabled in plenary which I ask you to vote against unreservedly. According to these, for example, the meagre fisheries budget should have to finance artistic heritage or encourage tourism at sea. Others, like Amendment No 4, which request financing for biological closures, also demonstrate a lack of understanding of fisheries regulations by requesting measures which are already in force, although admittedly there is room for improvement in these. I therefore ask you to reject the four amendments tabled so that we can close this chapter on fisheries and the environment with the thought which came up in the committee' s debate. These two areas are closely related and they suffer the effects of the same environmental attacks. As I have said many times before, the fisheries sector is more a victim than the cause of damage to the marine ecosystem and tomorrow we will be able to confirm this in the debate on the Erika. Mr President, Mr Katiforis' s report has the virtue of having brought life, debate and controversy to a communication in which the European Commission limits itself to listing a series of good intentions, although recognising its inability to put these into practice. Mr Katiforis has certainly not lacked the courage to set out the measures which, in his opinion, could help to improve and conserve the natural resources of the sea. Yet I must say that I disagree with many of his proposals because I am with those who believe that it is not just resources which are important in the fisheries sector but also the human beings who have been carrying out this activity for centuries. I agree with the rapporteur that the European fisheries and environmental policies should be better coordinated. However, what we are basically missing is the political courage and determination of the Commission and the Member States to take decisions and apply the current regulations. Maritime transport, employment and energy should be integrated together with fisheries and the environment. As for the Structural Funds, certain examples could be mentioned but I will leave this for another day. The European Parliament is aware of the limited resources and the need for responsible fisheries. The Commission and Member States should be meticulous in respecting the TACs and the quotas fixed in accordance with objective scientific criteria. The same yardstick should be used for everyone. As Mr Katiforis says, discards are a waste of resources which we cannot accept. Twenty million tonnes of unwanted catches are being thrown back. The fleet must therefore use increasingly selective fishing gear. This House has already indicated its opposition to driftnets and yet it is evident that certain countries are not only not respecting the undertaking to eliminate these nets but are increasing the number of vessels using these or simply not providing data given the passiveness of the national and Community authorities. We socialists consider that to defend the common fisheries policy is to defend a regulated and controlled fisheries sector. It is therefore essential that the Commission launches an information campaign on the CFP with this message.	de
The next point concerns the specific action we have undertaken. As you know, a high-level group has already been set up by the Portuguese Presidency, which will present its first report to the Summit Conference in June. The Portuguese Presidency has focused on two things: sustainable pension systems and social accession. I believe that the proposal for a corresponding group at Parliamentary level is very positive and can contribute towards our progress to the next step after approval of the said high-level group. Concerning some remarks about the role of social protection systems, the cost of social protection and the part played by those systems in the competitiveness of the Member States, I should like to say that in Europe policies strive to combine competitiveness and social cohesion. Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment. I think the statement' s content makes this clear. Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies. As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken. Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy. Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. WIPO treaty The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)]. Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States. In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry. It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products. It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty). Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed. Forgeries are big business. It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy. The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry. This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation.	es
And, in this regard, we approach the heart of the matter. This project, with its social harmonisation, does not constitute social policy. Instead, it is an extension to the EU' s EMU project, which is of quite special interest to the three countries which remain outside EMU and can rescue themselves from the sinking ship, namely Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark. It is therefore important for us to emphasise that we cannot support a proposal whose essential rationale is to extend the EMU project. ) Mr President, I voted for the Council's strategy for modernising social protection because, in my view, it constitutes a step towards the establishment of European social and pensions legislation, although it does not actually go the whole way. I was sorry to hear what was said in the previous explanation of vote, since I believe that, in essence, the report aims to provide much better protection for the elderly, despite the fact that, as we all know, the governments of the 15 Member States would like to reduce pensions to the minimum. I hope that Parliament will soon have the authority to legislate on pensions. The elderly are waiting for the European Parliament to make it possible for them to live more comfortably and with greater dignity than they do now. The countries who have made less progress in this field should attain the same level as the countries within the European Union that guarantee better social protection. . (DA) The Danish Social Democrats in the European Parliament have voted today in favour of the report by our Swedish Social Democratic colleague, Jan Andersson, on the Commission' s communication concerning a coordinated strategy for modernising social security. The starting point for the Commission' s communication is the implementation of EMU which, with its demand for stability and growth, creates the basis for the Member States' being able to maintain their social security arrangements. The report states that modernisation does not mean a reduction in the level of social protection but, rather, better use of available resources. We also notice that, according to the explanatory statement, modernisation does not mean harmonisation of social security arrangements, either, and that harmonisation might be downright damaging as it might place greater demands on weaker Member States at the same time that competitive considerations might exert pressure on others to cut back. No-one would benefit from this situation. Both in the communication from the Commission and in the report by Mr Andersson, it is emphasised that it is the Member States which have responsibility for and, therefore, also determine the content of, social security arrangements. Cooperation on these matters within the framework of the EU should create added value, based on the exchange of experiences and the reciprocal evaluation of the way in which policies are developing, the aim being to define best practice. . (SV) We consider that the report contains many practical proposals, which we support, but we are very critical of the convergence approach which permeates the report.	es
"Even today, we do not have definite answers regarding the monitoring of the nuclear power stations in the eastern republics. We therefore need resources available to spend before proceeding to enlargement, so that we can at last establish a European monitoring body responsible for monitoring quality of life and living conditions, with the aim of creating a new world where such tragedies will no longer occur. I would also like to say a few words on Africa, Madam President. The third and fourth worlds have been abandoned: just one dollar, one and a half euro would be enough to save a great many children. Europe, which is so democratic, so progressive, does not speak out or take these tragic problems on board, while half of Africa is dying of Aids and other diseases. One final remark regarding the Internet and globalisation. Globalisation of the economy must not be reduced to product and quality certification, just as the globalisation of politics must not come to mean levelling of values or dampening of hopes and enthusiasm. The peoples which do not participate and gradually grow more distant will leave the way open for an oligarchy that will take power and leave control in the hands of a few. As for the Internet, Europe has finally found the courage to say that we need rules. On a personal note, please allow me at this time to congratulate the pirates who, by acting the way they are, are forcing the world to reflect on the only system which is currently unregulated. We live in a world of rules and regulations: let us regulate the Internet too and give our fellow citizens rules and hope for the future. Madam President, as a Padanian taxpayer, I have already experienced the vice-like grip of the taxman and former Prime Minister of Italy, Mr Prodi, since Padania is liable to Italy for its taxes as well. Listening to him just now, I was concerned when he mentioned new resources, something that readily translates as additional taxation, in view, inter alia, of enlargement, that is the entry of new States into the Union. But why do they not buy their own entrance ticket? My Padanian electorate who, thanks to Mr Prodi, have already paid what in Italy is known as the European tax - repaid only in part - have absolutely no intention, thanks once again to Mr Prodi, of paying another tax for someone else. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, Members of the Commission, five months after its coming into office, the Commission committed to paper the direction in which it aims to steer the European Union. The ensuing document is both ambitious and bombastic. Is it not rather melodramatic to say that ""the world looks up to Europe"" ? Moreover, Europe as a continent is a great deal more than just the fifteen EU Member States. It is not rather ambitious to ensure peace, democracy and human rights in the whole of Europe, no less? I am particularly intrigued by how the Commission considers bringing this about. Does ""the European integration model as a rich source for global administration"" imply the export of a large-scale perspective and concentration of power? According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge! So who is this then?"	it
"Mr President, Commissioner, the peace process in the Middle East is an extremely delicate matter. It will only be possible for the exact borders of the state of Israel, the only democracy in that region, to be universally recognised once these negotiations have proved to be a success. The trade agreement between the European Union and Israel, which equally fails to define the territory of the state of Israel, should be implemented against this background. In addition, there is a significant connection between the economic activities within Israel and those on Palestinian territory. With this in mind, the Paris Protocol to the Oslo agreements also provides for a customs ""envelope"" comprising the state of Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Furthermore, the Commission and said parties have agreed to set up a joint working party to discuss issues concerning products' countries of origin. The Palestinian economy in particular is said to suffer under unilateral EU measures. Potential investors in this area have already indicated that they would withdraw if joint ventures were no longer given preference. Mr President, in general terms this House shares the concern expressed in Mrs Morgantini' s question. Commissioner Vitorino has clarified the Commission' s position and, in my opinion, has responded adequately to the concerns raised here. However, I feel that we should not leave the matter there. Starting from this previous statement, the lines of agreement could be extended on the basis of the privileged information which Mrs Morgantini and myself were able to obtain when we accompanied the President of this House on a tour of the area. Firstly, despite the current difficulties which we saw for ourselves in situ, we must repeat our support for the direct dialogue between the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Authority which is producing a fair, stable and definitive peace agreement. Secondly, it is in the interests of both parties to ensure the economic development of the region and to take decisive action to reduce the serious imbalances in the distribution of wealth in the area. Thirdly and finally, perhaps the Commission could bear in mind the usefulness of participating in the work of a tripartite working group, naturally involving the European Union, to guarantee compliance with trade agreements and to ensure progress in the assistance offered by the European Union to all the parties concerned. I have to say that I am satisfied with Commissioner Vitorino' s response: I feel that, on the whole, his speech did respond to the points raised in the question. I agree that we must emphasise the importance, for the European Union and therefore, from an executive point of view, for the Commission, of encouraging tripartite activities, particularly as regards levels of economic/financial and scientific cooperation. In this way, our financial involvement could be converted rather more often into a more significant political presence in the Middle East. This, in my opinion, is the lesson to be learned from such a long-drawn-out affair. With regard to the subject under discussion, I have just heard Mr Galeote and Mr Menéndez del Valle refer, respectively, to the visit of our President and that of President Prodi to Israel and other countries in the Middle East."	fr
Mr President, I should like to thank Mr Gutíerrez for his speech tonight and also for his Lisbon initiative, which is very important to us. If we are honest, we must admit that it has been a very long road from Luxembourg to Lisbon, and that really now we are looking for concrete achievements, for something to genuinely come out of this Lisbon Summit. We have a lot of Europeans in the gallery here with us this evening and I wonder what they make of our discussion here this evening. I would like them to take away with them this evening the idea that the institutions of the European Union are now embarked upon a genuine process, which will lead to full employment once again in the European Union. There are many challenges involved with creating that full employment. Some of those challenges will be very difficult to overcome, but the important thing is that we have to turn the rhetoric of what we have been saying for many, many years - about full employment, about a socially inclusive society, about a society that is based on innovation and knowledge - into reality. This is the great challenge, the great importance of Lisbon. I just want to dwell on one or two key aspects that will help us realise that goal of turning rhetoric into reality. Firstly, there is the commitment to having genuine benchmarks, a genuine process of peer review, to the setting of targets, of genuine targets that we can achieve, to governments agreeing to embark upon what is quite a brave process of saying: 'yes, we will allow ourselves to be marked against each other, we will allow ourselves to be marked against the rest of the world' . That really is a brave decision, because some Member States will clearly find themselves towards the bottom of the league table, which is something nobody likes. But this is important if we are to have a genuine achievable outcome from this Lisbon Summit rather than perhaps setting off down another road - a road which I know Prime Minister Gutíerrez does not want to embark on, because he actually wants to see something achieved in the process of the Lisbon Summit. There are other areas that we must look at. One of these is the challenge of creating an e-Europe which involves all its citizens and does not leave anybody on the wayside. Another is the process of actually having a genuine single market - which we still do not yet have - and skills training that will be the key to delivering that innovative and knowledge-driven society. There are tough choices, but once again in the gallery here tonight, I would like those people listening to this debate to take away with them the belief that we are going to actually have a society based on full employment, that the road to Lisbon will be the end of our journey, and that some concrete results will actually come out of it. I welcome the new strategic goal of making Europe the most dynamic and competitive area. Who could challenge such an ambition? I have to say, however, that dynamism and entrepreneurship as well as social cohesion are a very ambitious target, not to mention the creative tension between those two objectives.	de
"I do not believe that there is broad support in Europe for the introduction of qualified majority voting on taxation, justice and home affairs, and foreign affairs at European Union level. At present, under Article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions taken at EU level concerning tax changes must be by unanimity. I believe that this proposal should remain, as a common European taxation code would diminish rather than enhance the workings of the European Union. I support the enlargement of the European Union. I support institutional changes so as to ensure that enlargement of the Union takes place in a streamlined and structured manner. However, we must remember that the public opinion of 370 million people in the European Union is a vital factor in changing the EU treaties. Changes should not be brought about too quickly and cannot be too sweeping, otherwise public opinion will make ratification of any future European Union treaty very difficult indeed. Madam President, I am speaking on behalf of the Italian Radical Members. President of the Commission, a short while ago you said that no political structure sets out five-year plans. This is true, if we think of Russia' s plans in the thirties, but at the start of your mandate, a few months ago, you yourself announced at the Conference of Presidents that you would, however, be presenting a legislative programme, or rather, the major policy lines of the European government of which you are head and in the running of which we are engaged today. So, whether this is to be a government programme or a potential programme, the breakdown of the document you distributed to us and of the accompanying speech is not much more than a list of good intentions, or rather a list of issues on the table. It does not, however, give us the impression that the Commission is taking a clear position on any of these points, but that it is just doing the European Commission' s duty. In this House, in the past, large-scale debates have taken place on major strategic options which the Commission, under its power of initiative, launched, not as experiments, but as proposals which then made varying degrees of progress, but in any case did contribute to the integration and development of the European Union. In this case, Mr Prodi, we certainly have a kind of ""Ten Commandments"" : a whole raft of issues are listed, but if I may say so, we are left with the impression that the Commission is afraid to make any decision regarding what needs to be done about any of these points. There was only one point that you really stressed - too much in my opinion - and that was that it looks almost as if the highest priority task that you are setting yourself is to cease ""unnecessary"" activities. We should be careful, though, Mr Prodi, because we had a crisis of confidence in the previous Commission and backed this Commission - at least a parliamentary majority backed this Commission - precisely because, first and foremost, the reform of the Commission would bring consolidation, a new identity and a new awareness of being guided by a firm hand."	it
"Mr President, Minister, Commissioner, ""Women are half of heaven"" , a successful man once said. But when it comes to important decisions and priorities, there is a lack of women' s voices. Women, who constitute more than half of the population, are heavily under-represented within political, economic and social fields. That is unacceptable in a democracy. Where equality is concerned, the gulf between the actual and the ideal is nowhere more apparent than in the area of decision making. If we are to achieve a balance, a concrete action plan with a definite timetable is required. An important part of such a plan would be a benchmarking system to guarantee women' s full participation in power structures and decision making. I am therefore delighted that the Commissioner is well disposed towards a system of this kind. I propose that the EU' s objectives for women in the area of decision making should be based upon the averaged-out achievements of the three most successful Member States within each area, with the Member States each submitting a report annually which will then have to be evaluated. Women are the foremost victims of human rights abuses such as rape, sexual offences, domestic violence and the trade in women, but they are under-represented on the legal and legislative bodies which pronounce upon these crimes. The latter are consequently accorded low priority, and the perpetrators are often not prosecuted. Women are the prime victims of armed conflicts but are under-represented in peace-keeping efforts, conflict resolution and reconstruction work. In the resolution, we therefore urge the Member States to increase the proportion of women involved in all aspects of conflict resolution and peace-keeping. The call for women' s participation in decision making on an equal footing with men is not only a demand for social justice and democracy; it is also essential if women' s experience and knowledge are to be utilised to the full. Not to use women' s talents in decision making is an unacceptable waste. Women should not only be ""half of heaven"" but should also be entitled to take their share of responsibility for decisions which affect our entire planet. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the President-in-Office of the Council and Commissioner Diamantopoulou on the excellent speeches they have made today. We have high hopes for what you will achieve. We are at the start of a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their opportunity to occupy decision-making positions. We want this opportunity to bring substantial changes to our lives in society at large, we want democracy to be synonymous with equality between men and women, and we do not want women to be excluded socially or economically as is still happening today. Furthermore, we want values that women consider important, such as peace, fraternity, equality, justice, security and environmental protection, to be the guiding spirit for life in the European Union and, if possible, throughout the world. In order to achieve this, women must be given the opportunity to combat the inertia of a society which has, until now, been essentially imbued with masculine values."	es
This is a problem of compatibility between our directives on end-of-life vehicles and the former directives, including the one on auto-oil, which we voted on a few years ago. We must therefore congratulate the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on having the wisdom, in order to make things perfectly clear, to reintroduce the clause making an exception of the vintage cars which are part of our industrial and cultural heritage. In conclusion, let me say that this directive is not ambitious enough to solve the problems of present car numbers and it is rather hypocritical with regard to the fate reserved for the wrecks which still clutter our forests, lakes and gardens. Once again, the principle of 'polluter pays' is not being applied. The taxpayer is still footing the bill. Mr President, Commissioner, reading the leaflets which have been distributed in recent weeks, one would think that we were talking about the ultimate environmental catastrophe or the death of the car industry in Europe. Neither is correct. We simply must realise that the directive on the table is a sound directive. It means ecological progress for Europe, and we can be proud of ourselves if we succeed in enacting it and setting it in motion. All the same, there is one point on which we are in conflict. In the grand scheme of the directive, it is perhaps a minor point, but nevertheless a disputed one. It concerns the issue of recycling costs. Here we find ourselves fundamentally at odds with last year's debate in the Council when freedom from costs for the last owner and the issue of financing were lumped together and a question mark placed over whether the last owner should really be free from costs. Last February in this House we unambiguously decided (and we Social Democrats are sticking to this) that the matter of freedom from costs for the last owner is not open to question! So who will pay for the vehicles which are to be disposed of? For us this is straightforward: in the case of new vehicles it should be the manufacturer since this will also compel manufacturers to design and build recyclable cars. And what about vehicles which are already on the road? Let us look at an example. Rover in Great Britain, if they were responsible for all end-of-life cars, would actually be responsible for 5.8 million cars within the European Union and would immediately have to set aside EUR 250 million against recycling costs, whereas a manufacturer from Korea building similar cars would only have to shell out peanuts, as a representative of Deutsche Bank put it. Such distortions in competition are not about environmental protection; they simply affect investment potential and the jobs of those building cars in Europe. Consequently, for end-of-life vehicles we propose setting up a fund to cover the costs of recycling end-of-life vehicles in order to safeguard the principle of freedom from costs. I can understand it when colleagues from countries which do not build cars advocate that manufacturers should pay the full whack and that they are not interested in the problem of distortions in competition when it comes to setting aside funds.	it
These fears have been taking shape over the last two years and the banana row is the clearest expression of them. The developing countries are asked to fall into line with the liberalisation of trade, despite their vulnerable economies. Although Mr Corrie' s report roundly condemns this situation and reaffirms the Joint Assembly' s attachment to the Lomé model, he fails to highlight properly a second problem which, to tell the truth, is also the result of the free-trade error, namely the incoherence of the regional trade agreements signed by the European Union. The cooperation agreement with South Africa is a prime example. The Council approved the agreement negotiated by the Commission despite the fact that a basic section, namely agriculture, had not been finalised. As Paul-Marie Coûteaux rightly said in his intervention yesterday and in his proposed amendments, one wonders exactly what political coherence this blank cheque represents. It is most worrying, especially as a similar agreement with Mexico appears to be taking shape. Nor is it possible to support the rapporteur' s call for the European Development Fund to be merged with the Community budget. We want to maintain the clear commitment and the responsibility of each Member State, which is made possible by its intergovernmental nature. Alas, there have been far too many instances of collective aid for which no-one feels responsible being derailed and we do not want to extend this disastrous system to the EDF. Madam President, I welcome Mr Corrie' s report as a balanced assessment of the work the Assembly has carried out over the last year. The report comes just after agreement has been reached on the renewal of the existing Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month. The new agreement provides for a development budget of EUR 13.5 billion over the next seven years. It is vital that this money is used to benefit the poorest groups and individuals within the ACP countries. Strenuous efforts must be made to root out corruption and waste. Civil society must be involved in the planning and implementation of these projects. The decision to include a clause obliging ACP countries to take back illegal immigrants entering Europe is worrying and will have to be implemented with extreme sensitivity. I hope that before the end of this new Lomé Convention we will be able to welcome Cuba as a full member. . The joint United Nations programme on AIDS estimated that by the end of 1998, there was a total of 33.4 million people in the world living with the HIV infection. Over 95% of all HIV infected individuals live in the developing countries and sub-Saharan Africa is the worst affected region in the world. While only around 10% of the world' s population live in sub-Saharan Africa, 70% of all people who became infected with the AIDS virus in 1998 live there. 80% of the 13.9 million AIDS related deaths in the world have taken place in this region. The AIDS problem in Africa is not only a private or public health issue but a development one.	it
"Under-representation of women in politics, for example, continues to be the norm. The importance of enabling greater numbers of women to become involved in politics is, however, recognised. Only women are in a position to come up with policies likely to change structures which have been developed by men for men. For, whether in politics or in the labour market, structural discrimination is the main problem facing women. It is thus up to the European political parties to make themselves more accessible to women. Moreover, Article 191 of the Treaty (ex Article 138a) stresses, political parties are, I quote, ""important as a factor for integration within the Union"" . This article goes on to state that ""they contribute to forming a European awareness and to expressing the political will of the citizens of the Union"" . A condition of this type may have no legal value, but it is nonetheless of great symbolic value. It gives political parties an important role in building a democratic Europe. This may, for example, involve implementing positive action and promoting parity within our political parties. In the 1999 European elections some parties did put forward lists with men and women equally represented. This is an example of good practice which should be applied more widely. I do not know if there is some cause-and-effect at work here, but the fact is that the proportion of female Members in the European Parliament went from 25.7% in 1994 to 29.9% in 1999. Moreover, this Parliament has had a woman president since the 1999 elections. I shall conclude by repeating the conclusions of the conference organised by the Commission in April 1999 entitled ""Women and men in power"" . Equality between men and women is not a problem that affects women alone, but one that affects our entire society! - Some progress has been made recently in increasing the number of women present in decision-making bodies around the Union. In our own Institution, 30% of elected representatives are now women, including the President of the European Parliament itself. Finland too has just elected a female President. On average, one quarter of Member State governments are composed of women and a little over one fifth of their parliaments. This is still far from satisfactory, especially given that the figures vary enormously between Member States where the Nordic countries experience a much higher female representation in positions of responsibility and decision making. This situation has more to do with attitude and respect for the quality and abilities of women' s contributions to society than fixed quotas. My Group does not favour the use of quotas in general since, in the long run, they can be counterproductive and even undermine the cause they aim to support. Nevertheless, we recognise that the experience in all Member Sates is not the same and some recourse to such measures may be justified, as a temporary remedy, to rebalance female representation where women are grossly under-represented. We were able to support the resolution on women in decision making, adopted with a view to commemorating International Women' s Day on 8 March, which has incorporated ten Liberal Group amendments and softened the reference to quotas in line with the approach outlined above."	it
Action is not limited to legislation. To encourage and support dialogue as the cornerstone of the successful adaptation to change the Commission is also developing the recommendations of the Lillehammer Report by preparing the setting up of a European observatory on industrial change. We are also developing another suggestion of that expert group, the Managing Change Report. Let me finish by addressing some of the other concerns expressed in the draft resolution submitted to this House. As for the enforcement of the links between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that there is a provision in the merger regulation which enables workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission in the framework of the relevant procedure. Generally speaking, we recognise the need for proper consideration to be given in different instances to all aspects surrounding these kinds of operations, including their effects in terms of employment. As an example of this I mention that public authorities, notably the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid that came into force on 1 January this year so as to ensure that public funding remains associated with the recipients of regional aid and consequently with the jobs attached to the investment. To this end all regional aid is made conditional on the maintenance of the investment in question for a minimum period of five years. The same provision was included in the Structural Funds Regulation which means that it applies to all investments cofinanced by the structural funds. Social cohesion and the interplay of policies at EU-level is the focus of the forthcoming Lisbon Summit. I know we will be coming back to these issues again in the future to see how we can best make sure our policies are adapted and reformed to underpin economic and social progress in Europe. Thank you very much Commissioner. Mr Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I understand you have a point of order. If it is a personal statement, would you be prepared to wait until the end of this debate, at which stage I would be happy to call you? Mr President, the problem is one of public honour in this Parliament, it is not a personal statement. This morning, the President of Parliament, Mrs Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to allow me to make a point of order. Unfortunately, this is not the first time that Madam President has shown this inadmissible behaviour towards me. In doing so, Madam President has breached Rule 142 that states that points of order shall take precedence over all other requests to speak. She has also breached Rule 122 that gives the right to all the Members of this House to make observations, observations which in this case refute the remarks made by another deputy, Mr Vidal-Quadras. This partisan behaviour of our President should be criticised most firmly. I will willingly accept Madam President' s apologies any time. Thank you for your statement. We will certainly make sure that the President is informed of your statement. I can assure you that as far as I am aware the President never likes to have a debate on issues in the middle of a vote.	de
Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons. I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States. We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise. Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade. This constitutes a good example, therefore. We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily. We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication. Thank you, Commissioner. The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance. The debate is closed. Intergovernmental Conference The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)]. Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts. Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration. The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement. The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century. For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work. The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work. From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent. This is because the Helsinki agenda is limited to consideration only of the three issues that relate in a fragmentary way to the structure and operation of just two of the European Union' s institutional bodies. I will not repeat which ones, because everyone knows. My conclusion is justified on the one hand by the constant and sometimes very insistent demands of the peoples of Europe and on the other hand by the huge scale of the great enterprise in which the European Union is already involved, namely enlargement.	es
"I believe that this is a report for which cooperation between committees has worked very well, and the result, which we have received today, is moderate and thoughtful in a very delicate area. This moderation and thoughtfulness is particularly necessary in the implementation of Article 280(4). If we had to give a prize for the article which was most difficult to understand, least clear and most confused - however you like to put it - the competition would be very hard fought. The Treaty is a collection of complex articles. However, this one would undoubtedly be one of the firm favourites to win such a prize. At the same time, it is an especially delicate issue because it deals with the protection of the Community' s financial interests, as Mrs Theato has explained very well. We are all aware - and this Parliament has been the steadfast champion in this respect - of the need to protect the financial interests of the Community. But be careful. As the French say, ""ne jettons pas le bébé avec l'eau du bain"" [let us not throw the baby out with the bath water], that is to say, in the protection of the Community' s financial interests, we must respect, on the one hand - as Mrs Theato has said - the competences of the Member States, but also other matters which affect the citizens, which affect the essential guarantees. The conclusions of the Theato report safeguard them perfectly. Therefore, in my capacity as president of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, and, of course, as an MEP, I hope that a large majority of this House will support this report and that it will be well implemented by the Commission. Mr President, this, as Mrs Theato said, is a critical report. It is a report that has been proposed by the Committee on Budgetary Control and it is an own-initiative report. One of the reasons why we were very keen to bring this forward was because, whether we like it or not, the European Union has a reputation for fraud and mismanagement. It is sometimes exaggerated but there it is. We need to do something about it. Some of the measures we have put in place in the past have not been honoured by some of the Member States - and let us not forget that the Member States are responsible for implementing about 80% of the EU budget. A lot of them have not signed up to or not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests, and therefore it was clear that something more radical needed to be done. We need to take this responsibility seriously. We need to be able to prosecute people who commit fraud against the European Union. The question is: who prosecutes? That is where we really get into difficulty. Whose responsibility is it when you are dealing with a body that crosses so many frontiers? We need also to be sensitive to the concerns of Member States. The proposal to set up a European public prosecutor service is a very sensitive one. We are all aware that an all-out federal approach and a situation where a European judicial authority takes precedence over the national judicial authorities is a step too far for some people. But the discussion needs to begin and we are therefore calling on the IGC to start discussions."	de
In relation to China, we should not be dissuaded from raising the issue simply because discussions on it may be blocked. However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts as one, and threats of trade sanctions should strengthen rather than weaken our resolve. However, if full expression is to be given to the decisions which may eventually be taken at Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must be provided with the necessary resources. The financial resources of the United Nations are spread very thinly and because of this many crucial programmes are dependent on voluntary contributions to keep them afloat. Resources are also needed for promoting practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, the establishment of priorities and strengthening communications between the donor community and member states of the United Nations. To this end the High Commissioner recently launched an annual appeal for USD 53 million to enable her office to carry out these tasks. The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds. In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric. Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect. I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda. Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba. It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy. I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart. The first country is Indonesia. We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President. We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction. But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control. This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years. Tens of thousands of people are on the run. The situation is badly managed. I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening. My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas?	it
For us in Finland, a sparsely populated country, a visit to the post office is a social event. In the world of networking, the mail service is the most democratic of all networks. It creates and maintains interpersonal relationships. The common market in postal services will be created on the terms of the marketeers. For us in the north it will mean that the EU will be destroying the social infrastructure. Commissioner Monti, the principle of competition cannot be applied to interpersonal relationships: postal services must be improved, not run down. Only a public mail service can guarantee that information technology is within everyone' s reach in society. The post office is democracy. It is better suited to handling such matters than telecommunications companies. Telecommunications costs have risen as a consequence of companies being bought and sold and marketing costs accounting for more than 50% of companies' turnover. Democratic investments have to be made to preserve a democratic post office. It is particularly appropriate that Mr Monti is responding to this debate because the great conundrum with postal services is how to square an open market and free and fair competition with providing a service which is universally available to all, even in the remotest and least inhabited region of the European Union. In the hills and glens of Scotland and the rural borders and central belt, on the beautiful but fragile islands of the Hebrides, Orkney and Shetland, there is real concern at possibly losing this essential service. Yet we all know that service quality can only improve if postal services, like all service industries, are given the financial and management freedom of the private sector and the spur of open, even international, competition. I would suggest that there is a solution. It is already employed widely in the transport sector. Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract. Let us call this a negative tender franchise. This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system. Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner? The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time. Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender? It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose. Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace. Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate. That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services.	es
"It is therefore perfectly reasonable to raise the question of whether, when we talk about the problems of the new knowledge-based economy and of the new digital economy, which, as far as I know have created unemployment rather than employment in Europe, we are not replacing an inability to deal with the problems of unemployment in the present by what has largely been - and still is today - empty rhetoric about the problems of employment in the future... No one understands better than us the crucial role that the Internet, the digital economy and the knowledge-based economy have to play, but these issues were not what the Employment Summit was originally intended for. Mr President-in-Office, you concluded on a vaguely ideological note, which is fair enough. If this is the Social Democrats' policy for the economy of the future, then I would like to remind you that one of the most serious problems of the Internet economy and Europe' s lagging behind is the lack of entrepreneurial spirit in the education system, in the behaviour of governments and in the way the institutions function. This is what we must counter if we are to guarantee the knowledge-based economy of the future.  Mr President-in-Office, first of all, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament, particularly as your presence here symbolises what the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already referred to. By that I mean the political symbolism of the fact that during your tour of the capitals, you have also come to listen to the European Parliament. This is not the first time during the Portuguese Presidency that there has been a different and politically stimulating relationship between the Council and Parliament, but this is a significant gesture which, as my friend and colleague Mr Barón Crespo noted, we were delighted to note. Our position is clear: we support the Portuguese Government' s initiative. We support it because it is a serious initiative and because of its substance, both in terms of strategic objectives and in terms of other objectives with which we agree. Furthermore, the way in which this European Council is being prepared is a good illustration of this. Firstly, there is the seriousness and depth of the document presented in January. Then, there are the various preparatory conferences and the contributions that both business and union leaders are making towards this summit. In particular, there is the latest contribution to research that was made at the recent meeting which brought together Nobel Prize winners and Ministers for Science and Technology. This shows that the Portuguese Government is preparing for this Summit seriously and is paying a great deal of attention to its substance. However, we also support the initiative relating to the summit' s main objective, which has already been mentioned. We do so because for the first time, it is not only putting the issue of employment and social issues at the centre of the European debate but is once again suggesting that ""achieving the objective of full employment"" is in the realm of the possible. For years, many people have said this was impossible, that in modern society it would never again be possible. My congratulations, Mr President-in-Office, for making this issue topical once again without rejecting social cohesion and values which we hold to be fundamental, because they are not only at the heart of the founding project of the EU, but they are at the heart of our civilisation and, above all, of our understanding of the need for solidarity between all Europeans."	de
The lesson learned from the European experience is that where wages are lowest, where the salary ratio is the most flexible, unemployment is the highest and where wages are highest, where the social relations are the best regulated, the unemployment rate is the lowest. Mr President, I think that this policy will engender not hope, but deep disappointment in European workers. The vote adopted by our committee proves that it is not only the European Commission, ECOFIN and the Central Bank, but also the European Parliament which advocates and stands for an acutely neo-liberal economic and social policy which has already eroded the living and working conditions of workers and the wider working classes in the Member States of the European Union. Our committee emphatically rejected any attempt on the part of the rapporteur to use his report to introduce a different dimension into the debate on the economic situation in the European Union and to send the Commission and the Council the sort of message which the European Parliament should send out as the parliamentary body elected by the people of the European Union. Even the positive contribution of the international financial institutions and high-level experts, who gave the benefit of their concerns and ideas, failed miserably to muster any support. With this vote, the European Parliament has accepted serious liability towards the people who elected it, by supporting an extreme neo-liberal economic and social policy; a policy which promotes the privatisation of absolutely everything, categorically opposes any form of public sector, overturns workers' employment, wage, social and insurance rights, imposes a policy of budgetary austerity which is acutely anti-social and unpopular and acts on behalf of employers by asking workers to become more attractive and employable if they want to find a job. Our Group categorically condemns this perception and, in this sense, does not intend to support this resolution. It will be voting against it. Mr President, the report presented by the Commission on the Union Economy in 1999 appears to us to be mostly utter waffle as it scarcely shows why our performance remains hopelessly below the potential that the immense human resources of Europe should allow. Indeed, it is good to note that the forecast of 3% growth for the year 2000, which could have seemed rather bold when the Commission announced it in November 1999, now has a serious chance of being achieved, even in the context of continued inflation, since the peak of 2% for the euro zone in January, nevertheless remains quite minor compared with the past. But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps. We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies. But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency. In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances.	it
I will end now. I will not expand further. We will have the opportunity to do so on other occasions. But, obviously, as some speakers have said - and I thank all of you for your totally positive and relevant interventions - we cannot allow a situation where, within one, two or three years, we have to say once again that we have not done what we should have done. As for me, I can say, after having debated it in the College of Commissioners, that the Commission is prepared to present the necessary legislative measures, amendments and directives to Parliament and the Council, in order to equip ourselves with the greatest possible level of safety. The political will of this Parliament is required - and I can see that I can count on this - as well as that of the Council of Ministers. Thank you very much, Commissioner. We have taken good note of your intentions. I have received 8 motions for resolution, in accordance with Rule 37(2), to close the present Commission statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday at 12.00 p.m. Storms in Europe The next item is the Commission statement on the storms in Europe. Mr Barnier has the floor on behalf of the Commission. Commissioner, I would like to thank you for the ideas you have put forward, particularly on the very specific proposals concerning the people affected and who are expecting a lot from the European Union, in terms of the help that we can offer them. In the days immediately following this terrible storm I wrote to you myself with a request for you to ask the French authorities to redraw the boundaries of Objective 2 so that all areas devastated by the storms in France and elsewhere could benefit from Objective 2. I think that you must have done so, because you have not mentioned it. In fact, we all know that anyone who does not live within the perimeter of an Objective 2 region will find it all but impossible to obtain aid. We should therefore put this situation right immediately. You also know that this will not only be a short-term problem, but also a medium and long-term one. Let me explain. I was in the region of Lorraine at the time of this terrible storm which destroyed around 20% of deciduous forest. Indeed, for some 'forestry' districts, which have lost 20% of their trees, this represents a huge loss. We know, for example, that it takes between 150 and 200 years for a tree to reach maturity, so the loss these towns will suffer will not be spread over one, two or five years, but over many more. The towns concerned estimate that it will be spread over 40 years. I think that consequently it will be extremely difficult indeed to compensate these rural towns through subsidies for losses in their financial revenues. I think that this is something which we should continually bear in mind so that we do not lose sight of it in our various policies.	fr
If I had my way, I would wave a magic wand and equalise excise taxes across Europe. As a result, smuggling would no longer take place except if products were intrinsically more expensive in one Member State than another. But I do not have a magic wand and I do not have my way. This is an area of unanimity, as Mr MacCormick knows, and unless all Member States agree on the equalisation of excise taxes, it will not happen. Once again, towards the end of this year, the Commission will forward a report on the state of affairs on excise taxes, and I am obviously available for any discussion with Parliament on that report. Community policy in the field of water (continuation) The next item is the continuation of the debate on the recommendation for second reading of the Community action in the field of water policy. Mr President, the situation regarding fresh water in Europe is not as serious as in other parts of the world but, in general terms, it is a fact that the demand for water has continued to grow and its quality has continued to decrease. To this we must add the water pollution problems which afflict the potential new Member States in the East. In fact, a reservoir containing cyanide has just burst its banks in Romania, threatening aquifers which supply the population of Yugoslavia. I understand that Mrs Wallström, whose presence here tonight I appreciate, is going to visit the area. I believe that no country, no government and, of course, no member of this Parliament can fail to recognise the need for this directive in order to end the current fragmentation of water policy and facilitate the implementation of a programme of specific measures for each river basin. The development of this directive has been difficult and complex, involving diverse interests and divided opinions. I have no doubt that the rapporteur for this legislature, Mrs Lienemann, has made great efforts and shown great dedication in reconciling positions, and has succeeded to a large extent. However, it is almost impossible to understand and correctly assess all the different situations and expectations. I come from a country whose southern half is on the Mediterranean and the availability of water historically depends on the whims of an unpredictable climate and a difficult terrain. The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development by trying to overcome this adversity, century after century, year after year, day after day, and is still doing so today. Therefore, it seems essential to us that the directive complies, in practice, with the obligation laid down in article 164 of the Treaty on the need for Community legislation to take account of the diversity of its regions. In accordance with this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European People' s Party will oppose Amendments Nos 4 (Recital 21), 13 and 49 (Article 11(d)), since they imply a serious limitation in an area of management exclusive to the Member States, that is, the regulation of water resources. It would be very difficult for the Community to determine the conditions for the regulation of water in the different regions, given the different internal balances which are always in play and which require profound knowledge of the different areas and the relevant interests.	it
The policies of the European Union also have much to answer for in this situation. Of course we need to modernise these systems. In France, in particular, we need to stop making labour alone fund medical insurance and pensions. We also need to reform archaic management methods which create injustices, chaos and waste. More importantly, we need a family policy to promote demographic growth and an economic, monetary and fiscal policy to promote growth and reconquer the internal market so that we can create jobs. The Commission and the Andersson report are not proposing a social policy; they are giving Brussels exorbitant decision-making powers as regards funding, i.e. as regards the organisation and the provision of social protection services in the countries of Europe, which is why we voted against this text. Social protection should be an expression, first and foremost, of national solidarity and it comes first and foremost, exclusively in fact, under the jurisdiction of the nation state. Social protection should be based on the principle of national and Community preferences. Otherwise it is merely the financial processing, at the expense and to the detriment of European citizens, of the intolerable social situations which result from immigration. . (SV) We have abstained from voting for Jan Andersson' s report on a coordinated strategy for modernising social security. We are basically well disposed towards the European Union. As Swedish Liberals, we see European integration as an opportunity to find solutions to cross-border problems such as the environment, trade, movement across borders, human rights and conflict management. In these areas, Europe' s democracies have a chance to show the world that cooperation leads to peace and increased prosperity. We also believe in the principle of subsidiarity whereby decisions are to be taken as close as possible to those they affect. That is why we are actively pursuing the issue of a constitution for the European Union where the distribution of responsibilities is clear for all to see. It must be perfectly clear to all citizens that the EU will only become involved in those issues it is best qualified to deal with, which is to say cross-border issues. All other questions ought to be dealt with at local, regional or national levels. Social policy is an example of an area in which the EU ought only to have limited powers, except where it is a question of freedom of movement for people within the Union. Each Member State ought to have full responsibility for, and the right autonomously to decide upon, its social security systems. Health care, child care and care of the elderly are clear examples of areas which are not obviously transnational. The same applies to labour market policy. We do not believe that common European legislation in these areas is a solution to the problems involved in designing systems of social security. For us, it is important that the EU should instead concentrate on just a few areas in which it can really be of use. That does not, however, prevent the Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sphere. Equality and social security are issues which are traditionally high on our Liberal agenda. We wholeheartedly support, at national level, many of the ideas presented in Mr Andersson' s report.	de
You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks. Could you please give an answer on this issue? You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere. Quite simply there is no question of this. I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation. As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected. However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you. As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification. I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point. The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible. I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks. The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped. This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds. - Question No 46 by (H-0052/00): Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality. In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries? Mr MacCormick, the Commission has no plans to amend the rules concerning additionality which were stipulated, for the 2000-2006 period, in Article 11 of the general Regulation on the Funds. As in the past, these rules state that the additionality principle applies to the relationship between the Structural Funds and all development expenditure of the Member State. In this respect, it must be stressed that it is the expenditure financed by the Structural Funds which must be additional. The cofinancing provided by the Member State does not need to be additional to its existing expenditure. Provided that the Member State does not reduce all its own expenditure, the Structural Funds are added to the national expenditure and the principle of additionality is therefore respected. As for the budgetary provisions within the Member States, between central government and internal autonomous regions or countries, these are determined according to exclusively national considerations and are therefore not affected by additionality within the meaning defined in the rules.	es
So if she has any lectures to offer they are best contained within this House. She knows me well enough to understand that at all stages in the five years in which we worked together in this House, there has never been a single occasion on which I have refused to account in full, formally and in detail for everything I have done. Mr President, may I begin by paying tribute to the painstaking and, from what I hear, the pains-accepting work of Mr van Hulten in preparing his report. Although new to this House he is relatively old in some respects, certainly in his familiarity with the Institutions as a former official - and I think that the value of that is shown by his ability to tackle the complex subject which is of critical importance, as several Members have said, to all of our Institutions. I thank him and I wish him a long and distinguished career as a representative. Mr President, as you will know, Mr van Hulten's report on the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts is necessarily long and, since I want to make a comprehensive reply, particularly on the issues relating to financial management and control, I seek your indulgence. Naturally I will not take up any more of the time of the House than is absolutely necessary. When this House considered the second report of the Committee of Experts last September, I pledged on behalf of the incoming Commission that the report would be treated as a fundamental ingredient in the Commission's reform proposals. Our efforts to completely honour that pledge will be evident to the House when consideration is given to the reform package that was adopted by the Commission today, well within the demanding timetable that we set for ourselves four months ago. I am sure that Mr Pomes Ruiz is encouraged by that. The great majority of the paper's proposals are closely akin to those put by Mr van Hulten and that paper includes - I say to him and to Mr Staes - a very explicit timetable of actions to be undertaken in pursuit of reform. There is nothing therefore that is open-ended or vague about the report which I have had the honour to compile. The considered view of this Parliament in the consultation period over the next four to five weeks will for obvious reasons be of great significance. I would say to Mr Elles that we are most definitely in listening mode. But he will appreciate - with his customary generosity I am sure - that for us to be able to listen to the response to what we are proposing, it is first necessary to transmit what we are proposing. Hence the transmission. Though time forbids me, Mr President, from commenting in this debate on each element in the resolution before the House, I readily give the assurance that the details will be treated as an important input into our reform proposals throughout this consultation and indeed to our work in other relevant areas. Turning to the main themes of the resolution I offer the following observations.	de
That way, we will create a climate of cooperation which will be positive for the quality of the reforms. Parliament' s representatives at the Intergovernmental Conference must make it clear to those with whom they will be negotiating that, with the Union' s institutional changes, we are faced with responsibility for the constitutional development of the Union. They must therefore realise that such issues cannot be decided on the rationale of bargaining alone. The issues to be dealt with at this Intergovernmental Conference are exceptionally sensitive. It may be easy to come up with solutions, but what matters is how well those solutions will stand up in the long term. I will mention two point that may create tension. One is the balance which has so far been maintained between large and small countries. Europe is not, nor can it become a classic federal state. The solutions we opt for must be consistent with the fundamental rationale of the European Union, which is a union of states and peoples. The other area of conflict is more difficult. Owing to the imminent increase in membership, the bodies of the future European Union must become more effective. This means that they must function more simply and more rapidly. By its very nature, however, the European Union is, and will remain, a complex and convoluted multi-governmental institution. Possibilities for faster and more simple operation do exist. Of course they do, but they are not unlimited. If the limits are exceeded because of a one-sided quest for effectiveness, then the legitimising basis of the European Union will suffer. I am, however, optimistic. Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened. The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union. It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned. The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation. He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity. The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines. Last November, the Group of the European Liberal Democrat and Reform Party adopted a position on internal differentiation within the Union when it proposed a system of concentric rings for Europe: the onion skin model. In the next resolution on the IGC, Parliament must take a long and hard look at the questions of differentiation and flexibility. Both enlargement and the achievements of integration will come under threat unless we can create a system of concentric rings, as proposed by the Group of the European Liberal Democrats and Reform Party. My colleagues, Mrs Frassoni and Mr Onesta have already spoken, somewhat sceptically, about some aspects of the matter in hand. I wish to add a voice of concern on the topic of subsidiarity, not just between Union and Member States but between Member States and their own internally self-governing regions. This has been given inadequate attention and there are many things to be concerned about. May I particularly draw attention to one of the implications of enlargement in respect of this Parliament. A ceiling of 700 has been prescribed as the maximum that Parliament can safely become and remain a deliberative assembly.	de
Thank you, Mr Medina Ortega. I too wholeheartedly regret this situation. Would you be so kind as to write to me so that I have proof with which to tackle the competent authorities of both Air France and the French Government? This situation really cannot continue and we must therefore protest most strongly. Madam President, I had the same experience as Mr Medina Ortega yesterday. I feel that the French authorities - which have the honour of housing the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility to ensure adequate connections with all the capitals of the Union. Absolutely, Mr Napolitano. Thank you. Madam President, off the subject of aeroplane delays, I wish to apologise for the absence yesterday of my colleague in the Group of the Greens/European Free Alliance, Caroline Lucas, who is a British Member. She could not be here because she was arrested yesterday morning during an anti-nuclear demonstration in Glasgow. Although her identity was noted and her position as a Member of the European Parliament was very apparent, she was still held in custody all day. I regard this as absolutely unacceptable and would ask you to contact the British authorities in order to ensure that this does not happen again and that Mrs Lucas receives an apology. I have written to you in this respect together with my colleague, Mrs Hautala. Thank you, Mr Lannoye. I have received your letter and have already contacted the British Permanent Representative. Madam President, I should like to make a request in connection with today' s vote which I started to make yesterday during the debate on the EQUAL report. I should like the vote on the Community EQUAL initiative to be postponed because we need a bit more time to negotiate an important point. I am optimistic and quite relaxed and confident about the vote; we shall gain broad support for this opinion on EQUAL. We just need a bit more time to work out the details on the asylum question and I would therefore request that the vote be postponed from this morning. Madam President, to follow on from the point that Mr Lannoye made: Mrs Lucas was arrested just outside Glasgow for protesting against the Trident base at Faslane. I have a lot of sympathy with that protest. I have, however, no sympathy for Mrs Lucas trying to hide behind her Parliamentary immunity. I have also been arrested for protesting at Faslane. I did not hide behind any immunity. I took the punishment that came to me. Mrs Lucas should do the same. Madam President, I would like to comment on the request Mrs Stenzel has made to postpone the vote on the Community initiative EQUAL until tomorrow. In fact, this initiative was the subject of a very lively debate in committee, and, given that it is a major Commission proposal, which refers to the agreements we reached last year, I consider it admissible. We agree with Mrs Stenzel that the request to postpone the vote is admissible in the interests of achieving the greatest possible agreement between the groups, so that Parliament can express its position on this initiative with the broadest majority possible.	fr
Last autumn, we already heard Mr Bernard Kouchner call for a civilian police force. I am now delighted to hear that, this weekend, Mr Javier Solana is to call the interior ministers together to discuss the question of policing. I hope that this discussion will, in the first place, concentrate upon Kosovo so that the desperate situation there might be remedied. When it comes to the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council will comply with Parliament' s and, as I understand it, also the Commission' s demands for a multiannual budget for operations in Kosovo. The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, for example that we should provide ourselves with a military capacity for crisis management, an idea which has already been translated into practical action. Another, at least as important, lesson of our experience, however, is that it is better to prevent a crisis than to have to take emergency action subsequently. Therefore, the EU must also have an independent, credible conflict-prevention capacity. On behalf of the Commission, Commissioner Patten has taken a number of praiseworthy initiatives in this direction. I am thinking of the proposal to set up a rapid reaction facility and a rapid reaction force for non-military operations and to introduce headline goals for non-military operations, together with a Commission Crisis Centre. My last question to Mr Solana is this: what concrete preparations are being made for conflict prevention of this kind? How have these been organised by Mr Solana' s office and how has the initiative been coordinated with the Commission? Mr President, Mr Solana, you have the full support and confidence of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, but we would remind you of the huge responsibility which now rests upon your shoulders. I am thinking partly of the forthcoming and important humanitarian, peace-keeping and peace-making tasks. But I am also thinking of the responsibility you now have for ensuring that the new European cooperation on defence does not give rise to any kind of split between NATO and the EU or between the United States and Europe. Such a split would only delight the despots and rogue States which threaten freedom and human rights. I believe you heard the concerns which some members of the American Congress expressed last week here in Parliament. You must lay these concerns to rest for, as you yourself have said, when we are able to present a united transatlantic front, we are in a position to do something. When we are divided, we are weakened, and the suffering of the oppressed is prolonged. So, maintain as close contact as possible with our American allies and do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada, either. You also share a heavy degree of responsibility for ensuring that we do not end up as paper tigers. As George Robertson has said so often, we have two million soldiers but could not even put 40 000 soldiers into Kosovo. It may have been our weakness and lack of credibility which led to the war.	fr
But beware of the backlash from the workers and the unemployed, who we keep telling that everything is getting better and better while they find that their lives are not improving but, on the contrary, are getting worse. This is the key ideological struggle for Europe facing us. This debate, I think, has summed it up. The key political divide has been very obviously stated this evening, and it is no surprise that this issue has polarised the debate in a House which is known for its consensus and its carve-out politics, and I am delighted to see this difference of opinion made so clear, because this report is a radical one. This report is a wake-up call to Europe. This report recommends radical measures, which in essence will make it easier to employ people. It is as simple as that. The reason why we have such crippling unemployment rates in Europe is that it is too difficult in many cases to employ people because of the red tape and the regulation and the inflexibility of the labour markets. This is the only way to go forward, because the real way to deliver social justice in Europe - and after all that is what we are all here to do - is to deliver prosperity and opportunities and jobs. This report signals very clearly the most effective way to do that, because Europe has to wake up. It cannot create jobs just by government spending. It cannot create jobs by legislating to cut working hours, as if jobs were a cake that you carve up and divide between people. The real world simply does not work like that. And if Europe wants to be left behind, left behind to stagnation and to unemployment and to statism and to corporatism, than yes, vote against this report tomorrow. But if you want Europe to go forward and to start delivering to the people of Europe, then I would call upon you all to give your support to this report, because it will deliver those jobs, and it will deliver those opportunities, and it is the only way to do so. Mr President, the original version of the Giorgos Katiforis report had the great merit of making strong recommendations, based on the precise observations of the Commission report on the economic situation in Europe, for a European Union strategy capable of giving continuity and stability to the sustainable development prospects emerging this year for all the countries of our continent. These recommendations concerned the need for effective coordination of the Union' s economic policies and the need to overcome the way that economic policy is managed separately from social policy, which has hitherto been a serious barrier to the definition of a coherent strategy for fighting unemployment and moving towards full employment. It is this absence of management of the European economy which is responsible, my dear Mr von Wogau, for the fall of the euro. The report also contained recommendations concerning the creation of a European research area and the promotion in all countries of the Union of converging measures on research, lifelong learning and employability which would overcome any sort of unfair competition between the States in the field of taxation.	es
Our relationship with Armenia, as evinced by the agreement we signed with that country last year, is of course one element in these foreign relations. We also feel that, if Turkey wishes to move towards sharing the fundamental values of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union' s relations, regardless of whatever special bilateral conditions may apply to its own relations with any other country, it must in general act in accordance with the basic standards demonstrated by the European Union in its foreign relations. We are, moreover, convinced that this issue will be one of the priorities of the bilateral relations between the European Union and Turkey in the near future. Question No 6 by (H-0122/00): Subject: Ethnic cleansing of Serbs in Kosovo Since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU aimed at preventing the ethnic cleansing of Kosovar Albanians by Serbia, and since the arrival of KFOR on 12 June 1999, 200 000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been expelled and 768 murdered, constituting ethnic cleansing on a larger scale than that carried out by the Serbs themselves. During the last few days we have seen Serbs murdered by Kosovar Albanian Mafia-type groups, also with impunity. What decision will the Council adopt to put an end, once and for all, to this ethnic cleansing and to guarantee respect for the human rights of the whole population of Kosovo, irrespective of race or creed? I thank the Minister for his response, but I would also like to point out that, statistically, there is now more violence in Kosovo than there was before the NATO bombing. It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action. I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area. We are therefore all to blame. I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context. Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia? Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government. Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet. The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself. Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders?	it
This is going to lead us to make 'Culture 2000' the programme of the citizen. The increased participation of our citizens is something I hope and pray for. I would like this participation to be as extensive and productive as possible and I undertake to work to ensure that in the course of the five years covered by the programme it becomes a tangible reality. I know that you, as Members of Parliament, in your own regions and countries, are all going to work together with the programme participants so that all these small flowers, as one Member of Parliament said, go to make a vast multicoloured carpet. I should like this programme to become a practical reality and for culture to be not only a factor of enrichment for our citizens, both in personal as well as in social and economic terms, but a right which it is our job to assert, and also the hallmark of rediscovered interaction within the Union. This is what our European 'Culture 2000' programme offers. It does not compete with the cultural policies implemented in the various Member States. Such policies are necessary, and I would like to see them developed further. It simply adds to them, complements them, building a bridge between the various cultures of our various countries. I feel therefore that extending and enriching European citizens' participation in culture is a crucial task, one which justifies the efforts we make to achieve it, and this is the yardstick against which we must measure the success of our programme and of our Union. A number of Members of Parliament have quite rightly raised this point. If the Union is purely an economic union, then it is a stillborn project. However, if it is a union of culture, civilisation and participation, then it becomes a living thing. This is the foundation, ladies and gentlemen, which I intend to develop, and I shall take the following five areas into special consideration: firstly, providing creative people with opportunities of an innovative nature to allow their talent to find the support it deserves in our programme. Secondly, encouraging exchanges, mobility and training in the cultural sector. Thirdly, promoting cooperation between cultural operators. Fourthly, increasing audiences for culture, with particular emphasis on attracting young people to culture and, fifthly, protecting the common cultural heritage on the European scale as well as the history of the peoples of Europe, and making them better known. The new programme will, I am sure, in terms of its structure and organisation based on transparency, efficiency and balance, prove to be an instrument as successful as it is essential to our measures. Madam President, I reiterate my thanks to Parliament for its support and for, once again, having shown the importance it attaches to culture in the context of the Union. I am certain that it will not be disappointed, having given us its support, and I personally undertake to keep Parliament informed, as things progress, of the various phases of the implementation of our measures and the measures of our citizens, which I hope will be great measures for the future of the Union. Thank you, Commissioner. I think we can also thank the rapporteur once again. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. (The sitting was closed at 9.55 p.m.) End-of-life vehicles The next item is the debate on the recommendation for second reading (A5-0006/2000), on behalf of the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection, on the common position established by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament and Council Directive on end-of-life vehicles [8095/1/1999 - C5-0180/1999 - 1997/0194(COD)] (Rapporteur: Mr Florenz)	it
During the budgetary procedure we were told that the funds for Kosovo must be voted on as a matter of urgency yet, according to our information, no invitation to tender has been published or initiated to date. This is serious, since it holds up the whole process of reconstruction in Kosovo. Finally, and this follows on from what I have just said, we would like the Commission to inform the Committee on Budgets on a very regular basis, monthly, regarding progress on payments made. We have Commission documents which speak of firm commitments. It is not firm commitments that we need, just plain commitments would suffice, and we need to know what has actually been paid and, more especially, what has not been paid. Kosovo has suffered far too much from delays in payment. Mr President, if we are going to discuss Kosovo today, as we have done many times before, then we should also start by taking stock of what has actually already been done in Kosovo, or of whether in fact anything has been done at all. What I mean to say is that a few small steps have already been made along the path to normality, and it would be nice if they could at least be listed in the course of such a debate. As of 9 February, there will be something known as the Kosovo Transitional Council, which will comprise representatives of the political parties, the minorities and civil society, and which is intended to be a quasi interim parliament. This is a positive move and we welcome it, but I believe we need to equip the individuals concerned with an instrument and with strategy planning for what they are actually going to have to prepare, for elections are planned for the autumn. No one really knows what these elections are to lead to and what kind of parliament is to be formed as a result. No one knows what kind of authority this parliament is going to have vis-à-vis UNMIK. In other words, there are quite a few imponderables that we are not being informed about and that others are presumably unable to get to grips with properly either. Of all people, it is the Albanians, who are now being integrated into the transitional council, who ought in fact to have a little more idea as to what is in store for them. In addition to financial outlay and reconstruction work, urgent attention must also be given to restoring the coexistence of Serbs, Albanians and other minorities - not forgetting the Roma of course - in this country, so that at some point in the near future, on the road to coexistence, it will hopefully be possible for some form of reconciliation to take place. I would like to list again the things that have actually already been accomplished and that we can be pleased about. Administration-wise there are now 34 tax inspectors. That is excellent news! There too, people are being encouraged to pay their taxes, for it will not do in the long-term for everyone just to depend on handouts from the EU and from other donors; some of the money for these activities must come from their own resources. It should also be noted that of the 19 departments, 4 already have administrative leadership, which represents an improvement on the situation there hitherto. There is something else that we are keen to develop and this is very important for a state under the rule of law. We have 130 judges and public prosecutors, who have now been sworn in, and who are ready to take up their work of dispensing justice, with a view to enriching the culture of tolerance there a little, and to at least being able to track criminals down and then secure convictions.	de
I do wonder why public health cannot be mentioned in this respect. It is, after all, a key element of social protection which is rather in crisis and which, in fact, costs a great deal of money and is essential to a great number of people. However, apparently, the Council is not ready to discuss it at this stage. Mr Barón has caused me some concern by saying that the programme which your are presenting, Mr President, is in fact a socio-democratic programme. I went over your speech again in my mind and I think, in actual fact, that it contained one point which had a strong socio-economic bias. It was the point in which the macro-economy is arranged such that it will lead to employment. It is, of course, a fact that a sound macro-economic policy will automatically result in an improvement in the employment situation. We have experienced this. But on the other hand, the sound rule of macro-economics should not be misused by pinning it down too much. Indeed, you will then end up in a situation which a great many economies under socio-economic and socio-democratic rule have experienced - and are still experiencing - where eventually, employment becomes the victim of bad macro-economic policy. This should not happen. I do hope, therefore, that the Prime Minister does not suggest abolishing the macro-economic policy which we have pursued over the past couple of years and which has been very successful - or at least changing it such that it is no longer effective. Finally, Mr President, I have a problem with the Portuguese Presidency' s documents and also to some extent, but less so, with the Commission' s documents. It is their defensive nature. We have a few countries in Europe, including Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland, which rivalled the United States in terms of sound performance in the field of employment. So it is possible for Europeans to match this. There are other countries which appeared far less capable of doing this. It is then far more sensible to find out why some countries or regions are doing so very badly, rather than saying that we are underperforming compared to the United States. I think that, overall, this is not the case at all, especially if we take into account the fact that the internal market has only been in operation since 1 January 1993, which is a relatively short time. Mr President, Prime Minister Guterres has been most convincing. The proposals made by the presidency mark a clean break from the usual Community jargon. The citizens of Europe do not want a theological debate, they want to see tangible action. According to Professor Fitousi, the most serious deficit currently threatening European society is the deficit of the future. Many of our fellow citizens are fearful of a future that been starkly portrayed to them for the past two decades. The most minor of accidents is depicted as an irreparable ecological disaster. Science is often demonised, with the result that fewer and fewer young people choose to study science. People are asked to be flexible, and to embark on the breakneck quest for productivity.	es
We must get away from the situation where we are only aware of human rights when they hit the headlines or abuses are being punished. The role of Parliament is to meet the issue of human rights head on, particularly at the level of prevention. In that sense, we need to be able to export a culture based on legality and respect for the law. It seems to me that we have finally reached the end of a long period during which a whole raft of treaties appeared and were duly signed. Nowadays, there are many, perhaps too many, treaties on human rights. If those treaties remain mere expressions, they are no more than useless depositories of people's thoughts. The time has come to move on to a new and crucial phase, namely a phase in which the provisions of the treaties are applied on a daily and binding basis, although we ought not forget that some basic treaties are still to be transposed. I refer to the Rome Conference and the fact that 14 of the 15 Member States of the Union have still not ratified the treaty establishing an International Criminal Court. In my view, we should be evaluating and modifying some of the political instruments we use to measure the status of human rights globally. We have often employed instruments which, at the formal level, make us feel comfortable, but which, in terms of practical results, are totally ineffectual. By that I mean the use, and often abuse, of embargoes during recent years, and the over-cautious application of the clause allowing suspension of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, where there have been human rights violations. In particular, we should be updating the areas where human rights need to be safeguarded. Globalisation could easily come to be regarded as a harmful process. Many countries are currently questioning the principle of the universality of human rights. The belief is widespread that many human rights, including the right to life, contradicted as it is by the death penalty, depend on certain variables, while globalisation, which often has a negative connotation, is in danger of becoming the catch-all for rights, actions and policies everywhere in the world. We should therefore do what is necessary to update the areas in which we can intervene, with renewed strength, to safeguard human rights. In that context I would mention the following: social rights, workers' rights, quality of work, the need to ensure respect, where necessary, for all the criteria laid down by the International Labour Organisation, the right to tolerance and to respect - a right to which all minorities are entitled, particularly within the European Union. I would also mention the right to develop. It is the right of all peoples who, in turn, are the sum of countless individuals each one of whom has the right to develop and to a future that, most importantly, is full of hope and personal growth, within each individual society. All those aspects should be part of a rationale, a discourse and a contribution which the European Union should bring to human rights.	es
But the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 1, 4, 9, 11, 13, 15, 19, 23, 39, 40, 41, 49, 51, 59, 61, 64, 66, 70, 71, 72, 74, 77, 83, 87, 90, 91, 92, 95, 97, 98, 81(rev.), 100, 101, 103 and 107. Thank you for your attention. (The President declared the common position approved as amended) Report (A5-0033/2000) by Mr Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication from the Commission on a concerted strategy for modernising social protection (COM(1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182(COS)) (Parliament adopted the resolution)President. That concludes the vote EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE- Lienemann report (A5-0014/2000) . (FR) I welcome the quality and the ambition of this report on LIFE. I shall briefly remind you that LIFE is a financial instrument used to support environmental policies within the European Union and also in third countries, whether they be neighbouring countries around the Mediterranean, countries around the Baltic Sea or applicant countries. The Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection has proposed many amendments which have, for the most part, been retained in the common position adopted by the Council. As far as the third phase of LIFE (2000-2004) is concerned, the instrument is to be divided into three sections, LIFE-Nature (47% of the resources), LIFE-Environment (47%) and LIFE-Third Countries (6%). In my opinion, the most important amendments concern the following: LIFE' s contribution to sustainable development within the Community and also to the development of Community policy in the field of the environment, particularly regarding the integration of the environment into other policies, as well as to the implementation and updating of legislation relating to the environment; Improving the efficiency, transparency and methodology of procedures for the implementation of LIFE, procedures for information and the dissemination of such information to the public, and procedures for cooperation between recipients; The objectives of LIFE: this must have as its main objective sustainable urban development, in close association with the pilot projects carried out under the URBAN initiative, on which I have had the opportunity to speak elsewhere; The contribution that the projects supported by LIFE make to the sustainability of social and economic activities, and thus job creation. I consider it crucial that the LIFE instrument should remain open to the participation of candidate countries from central and eastern Europe. The other candidate countries (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey, Malta) my also take part in LIFE when agreements permitting such participation are signed with these countries. The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million. I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance. The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement. If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme.	it
At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally by its end, and notably where we fit into international monetary bodies, where we fit into UN agencies and so on. We need to open that debate. In conclusion, this morning, the day after St Valentine's Day, the newspapers are saying that your honeymoon period is over. I do not know whether you are a romantic or not, Mr Prodi. Perhaps this is a very unromantic thing to say on such a morning. However, we in the Liberal Group welcome this because it means we are now settling down to business. That is the way it should be. Regarding the many adjectival descriptions of Europe you addressed in your speech - an energetic Europe, an enterprising Europe, a Europe that has a human face and is inclusive - let me, in a word dear to the heart of my Liberal colleagues, give in one adjective, one description of the kind of Europe we want to see in your plan for governance: an enabling Europe. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, I greatly admire the openness with which you admit that the European Union must change fundamentally. You gave consideration to important questions of principle in your programme. I believe that the public will start to show more interest in politics if we can tackle the major issues alongside the day-to-day ones. At the same time, however, it has to be said that, unfortunately, your programme reminds me in many ways of a party manifesto. There are a lot of good intentions in it, but it very much lacks concrete proposals concerning how this can all be achieved. As in any other party manifesto, it is full of contradictions. I would like to take this opportunity to help you recognise them. First let me speak about the economy and social development. We have to be able to think hard about how we can coordinate the aim of competitiveness with the aim of full employment; that is what was mentioned in your programme. Should we at long last be drafting convergence criteria, in which - as you in fact hint at in this programme - the aim would be that unemployment in no Member State should be higher than, say, the three most successful countries in this matter? Ecological tax reform is what my group would like to stress the importance of, because we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing our taxation structure. But, unfortunately, as we all know, this is an area where the European Union is totally unable to act. Do please raise this issue at the intergovernmental conference. The EU can only achieve authority in the fact that it focuses on tasks that individual countries cannot attend to alone. In this respect, Parliament will definitely defend, along with yourselves, the importance of supranational decision-making. One contradiction within your programme relates to globalisation. I think it is very creditable that you should mention the concept of 'global administration' , as others too have said here.	fr
I very much hope that you, Commissioner Monti, will support these amendments, and I look forward to your comments and to finding out where you stand on this matter. To conclude, I want to welcome the Commission' s XVIIIth Report on Competition Policy, on which, once again, a good deal of work has been done. But, as I have already mentioned, our overriding objectives ought still to be those of transparency and openness. There is still a need to tighten up in the areas mentioned, and there is therefore good reason for continuing to work resolutely towards solving the problems concerning the lack of transparency and openness in the area of state aid. This is especially necessary in relation to the forthcoming enlargement of the Union, and I should like to thank Mr Jonckheer who, in his report, has considered very thoroughly the problems associated with enlargement and with ensuring that the applicant countries are able to meet our criteria, as well as with ensuring common conditions of competition. As Liberals and Greens, we clearly have different opinions on how the world should look, but we are well on the way to agreement as to our objectives, and we shall try to find reasonable solutions to our problems. Mr President, Commissioner, there are just two questions which must be answered. Are state aid to business or inter-company agreements legitimate in a market economy, and who must supervise these exceptions to the absolute rules of the market economy? Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid. It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements. So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified. The von Wogau report proposes referring supervision of the legitimacy of individual cases to national level. We feel this is relatively dangerous, but all the same we shall vote in favour of it because we recognise that the Commission cannot do everything. We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact. Mr President, once again we are debating the European Union' s competition policy. But let us stop to consider the circumstances in which this debate is taking place and the conclusions to which it should bring us. The overriding features of today' s economy are massive mergers and acquisitions involving huge companies with a market monopoly and the emergence of frighteningly powerful multinational groups. Should we not be discussing this issue? We need a competition policy which can and will introduce controls on the activities of these private-sector monopolies.	es
We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable. The Commission is giving up its monopoly on exemptions. Competition restrictions are to be automatically exempted against the background of this planned system of legal exemption, insofar as the provisions of Article 81(3) of the Treaty on European Union allow. The requirement to lodge applications in Brussels will be dropped; in other words, the Commission will be completely in the dark in future. This is unacceptable to my mind. The Commission' s programme is to be supplemented by enhanced follow-up supervision of the national authorities and Member States' courts. But if this takes place in the course of renationalisation then what we will have here is a patchwork quilt of competition policy. This is unacceptable in my view. It would weaken a key element of European policy. The change of system in European monopolies law that the European Commission is contemplating is high risk as far as competition policy is concerned. There are enough other options in the present system to safeguard open markets and free competition. In any case, the Commission' s proposal refers back to old proposals that were put forward as long ago as the fifties and sixties. There was no majority for this at the time. Since France laid a huge amount of emphasis on legal exemption at the time, it was damaged by concessions in agricultural policy. Forty years on, this proposal has again been placed on the table and I am certain that it will create room for manoeuvre for the monopolies, to the detriment of Europe' s consumers. I consider this to be unacceptable. Mr President, in this important debate on competition, I am speaking this morning with particular reference to Mr Langen' s document on the Steel Aid Code. As the Court of Justice recognised in 1996, the steel industry is particularly sensitive to competition-related disturbances. Indeed, several years ago, this was the conclusion of a report that I compiled on the strengths and weaknesses of the European steel sector. This is why it was justifiable to set up a system of aid to this sector with the aim of ensuring the survival of successful businesses, even if this was in contradiction of Article 4 of the ECSC Treaty. This indeed, is the aim of the sixth Steel Aid Code, but at the same time it is important to avoid any infringement of the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets, hence the importance of regulating such aid. It is therefore necessary to continue to limit state aid for research, development, environmental protection and cases of company closure. In the same category of ideas, it is essential that Member States fulfil their obligation to be accountable to the Commission for the aid granted to their steel companies. The Commission suggests shorter deadlines. I agree with this request. Like the rapporteur, while I am pleased with the Commission report, nonetheless I deplore the fact that it does not cover all aspects of the aid. Although the Steel Aid Code is expressed in a very clear way, the Commission has authorised granting steel companies aid which is not covered by the categories stipulated by the Code. In the interests of equality, either the Code must be applied or it must be modified. Finally, and in conclusion, Mr President, with the expiry of the ECSC Treaty, the regulations will have to be reviewed since I think that the aid system will have to continue beyond 2002, and in that case I am in favour of a Council regulation which will ensure security in this area.	de
(Applause) Madam President, we the Belgian Christian Democrats are concerned as, fortunately, are a great many other Members too. The coalition which is being created in one of the Member States is clearly an Austrian affair but undoubtedly has a European dimension too. Because what is it that unites us in Europe? Surely it is the values and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, more than anything. The Austrian Freedom Party leader, Mr Haider, has repeatedly repudiated these values. He also repudiates the basic forms of diplomatic politeness. He is a dangerous man. The Christian Democratic parties in my country have made up their minds a long time ago and they stick to their decision to listen to the protests of extreme-right voters but never to negotiate with extreme-right leaders. Values should take precedence over power. We deplore, therefore, what is happening in Austria. In fact, we were shaken by it. We are extremely disappointed. As a last resort, we would ask the ÖVP to look into alternatives. We keep reminding them about Article 6 of the Treaty. We continue to fight against the trivialisation of the extreme right. If, despite this, the coalition goes ahead, we would urge the ÖVP party members to ensure that the principles and values which underlie European integration are observed in political programmes, both in word and deed. Madam President, Austria awaits a heavy responsibility. Madam President, it is clear that we in this Parliament are very largely agreed on rejecting Mr Haider and his politics, but it is equally clear that opinion differs as to the most effective way of opposing this brand of politics. Have you stopped to ask what kind of effect the debate we are having here and the statement delivered by the Council Presidency last weekend are having in Austria itself? Have you stopped to ask whether or not we will also be responsible for the way in which the political situation unfolds from now if we set ourselves up to pass judgement on it here? Have you stopped to ask what would happen if the wish of a certain fellow MEP was to be fulfilled and elections were to be held in Austria in the course of the next few days? From all accounts, this would only serve to strengthen Haider. Who would want this to happen? Is it not our responsibility to give thought to how we should tackle this brand of politics? Europe is a community of law. Democracy, respect for human rights and rule of law are amongst the principles that we must uphold. One of the precepts of democracy is that we should not disapprove of electoral outcomes but respect them, and that is why we must respect the fact that the Austrians, by virtue of their political culture, voted as they did. It is for reasons of constitutionality that the President-in-Office of the Council ought not to have made the statement he did, and in a manner that goes against the Treaty.	es
We must adopt preventative measures which can stop disasters like this from happening in the future. This is the essence of my oral question on behalf of all the members of the Committee on Fisheries. We hope to hear specific proposals from the Commission, with plenty of action and no more regrets. This House will today approve a very important and appropriate joint motion for a resolution tabled by several groups. Mr President, the shipwreck of the Erika off the coast of Brittany on 12 December caused an oil slick whose effects on the environment will be felt for years. In addition to destroying natural resources, this accident has had a serious impact on certain economic sectors, particularly those dependent on fisheries. With 20 000 tonnes of crude oil left in the holds of the sunken vessel, the situation could still deteriorate. The consequences of this accident have been disastrous for the aquaculture and ostreiculture sectors which were defenceless against the pollution that could not be prevented from coming ashore. These consequences not only stem from the pollution which occurred immediately after the accident but also the subsequent loss of market share and the rejection by the consumer of a fully guaranteed product which is now affected by the pollution itself. The regions affected are outlying ones with an unstable economic balance. They have been profoundly affected by this oil slick which, unfortunately, is not an isolated event. The main resources of these and neighbouring regions are those granted by nature, which is nowadays too often being punished by man' s activities. These events could be prevented with more care and control by the public authorities. Prevention is better than cure or so the saying goes. Surely the budget would agree, as prevention is much cheaper than the cost of disasters like these. Mr Fischler says that he always comes to the House when asked. Yet on the issue of the Erika he has given the impression, perhaps not to us but certainly to the inhabitants of Brittany and the Vendée, that, as the Fisheries Commissioner, he is not always available or, at best, available only on a part-time basis. As this House indicated in its first resolution on 20 January, the needs of the severely affected fisheries, ostreiculture and tourism industries must be taken into account. We therefore now call upon the Commission to urgently adopt measures to help the fisheries sector by means of special funds. Galicia and Brittany now have the common ground of having suffered from oil slicks. We cannot understand how it is that experiences like the Urquiola or Amoco Cadiz have not served to reinforce legislation on maritime transport in terms of both controlling safety in the movement of dangerous goods and flags of convenience. Please let this be the last disaster of its type and let us learn all possible lessons from this. We must urgently amend our legislation and close the loopholes which keep allowing these terrible disasters to happen. The polluter pays principle is both necessary and appropriate.	fr
This body was established back in March 1969 and is formally obliged to meet biannually, however the norm is that it meets annually and takes its decisions on the basis of scientific advice. The body then makes recommendations with a view to maintaining stocks. This body has four standing committees comprised of national experts dealing with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance and conservation and management measures. They have also four panels dealing with tropical tuna, with temperate tuna, the north and temperate tuna south and other species. These panels are powered to initiate regulatory measures on species covered by the convention. Proposals made by the panels are then presented to the Commission and the Commission in turn makes recommendations to the contracting parties. These conditions are binding, however contracting parties may lodge objections within a six-month period. The European Union is a contracting party and is obliged to embody such recommendations in Community law. At a ICCAT meeting in November 1998 in Santiago de Compostela, changes were recommended to the rules relating to the landing of the minimum size of bluefin tuna. ICCAT also made recommendations in 1974, 1994 and 1996. As of now, it is illegal to land or sell bluefin of zero age and that of course is - in weight terms - less than 1.8 kilos. At its recent meeting in November 1998, the ICCAT standing committee on research and statistics was asked to perform a new assessment of the western Atlantic and eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean bluefin tuna populations. The information provided would then assist the organisation in considering developing and improving stock rebuilding plans. It was agreed that the SCRS should present a study at the 1998 meeting. It was intended that this meeting be presented with various possible recovery options with a view to maximising sustainable yields by taking into account alternatives or possible levels of recruitment and mixing of stocks. It was intended that the study should indicate monthly closures to purse seine, in order that the closures would be effective for the conservation of bluefin stock. Following all of the research, the meeting agreed to a selective closure rather than a general prohibition of fishing for tuna in the Mediterranean with purse seine during the period 1 August to 31 August. It is important to protect the tuna fishery for future generations. Bluefin tuna is the world' s most expensive fish fetching up to EUR 90 000 per ton at the auctions in Tokyo and, of course, the indication of the importance of the Mediterranean tuna is that it accounts for 70 percent of global landings in the region of 30 000 tons. 80 percent of it was landed by purse seine. The Mediterranean is an important spawning area for bluefin tuna so therefore it is important that the necessary measures be taken to enhance the protection of juveniles. The minimum size must be respected and technical measures must be implemented if we are to eliminate the zero age. The measures agreed in November 1998 are binding since 21 June, I repeat 21 June 1999, months before the communication was forwarded to the Parliament' s Fisheries Committee and 9 months almost to the date.	fr
"The truth is though, that the Commission' s guidelines do not fully meet these objectives. On the other hand, it is crucial that there are precise indications and sufficient funds in areas such as creating decent jobs - with rights - effectively promoting equality in law and opportunity, and supporting the social economy and solidarity. There must also be support for rural development, for small and medium-sized enterprises, for improving the quality of life of urban populations in deprived areas, specifically in the field of social housing, with a view to achieving sustainable urban development. . (IT) While Article 158 of the EC Treaty aims to promote the harmonious development of all of the Communities, we must say that the goal of eliminating disparities is still a long way from being fulfilled, or rather in some cases, as with Italy' s Objective 1 zones, paradoxically, disparities are being exacerbated, particularly because of the continuing weak approach of the structural apparatus to Community procedures and the persistent muddle of procedures; despite the changes to the rules, the Community structures have not yet been streamlined. In the first place, if administrative procedures are not simplified, it will be hard to attain Community objectives on reform, with a view to greater efficiency and concentration. In this respect, the Commission document has shortcomings, as it makes no recommendation to the Member States to simplify procedures and national legislation for the presentation and examination of projects by the national authorities, and for their funding, execution and monitoring. SMEs, micro-enterprises and craft businesses in particular are still ""weak operators"" , given that it is precisely for them that the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, are major obstacles to accessing Structural Funds. A considerable stumbling block is the fact that the regions and other operators find it impossible and are incapable of making plans in time. In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines. This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance. In general, the current guidelines cannot be considered as clear or transparent. They merely touch on the - nevertheless important - issue of the possibility of assessing the progress made in relation to verifiable objectives which are completely consonant with the strategies followed in Community policies, and they do not pay enough attention to the implications of enlargement, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications as regards either regional and national authorities, or candidate countries. That said, the differing approach adopted in the guidelines, which are not geared to geographical objectives, but rather to policy areas, can be considered as positive."	es
The proposed exhaustive collection of data and the appropriate management of this data will be very valuable in helping to tackle the revision of the common fisheries policy in a more rigorous manner. This will only be true, of course, if the data can actually be obtained because, as rightly pointed out by our rapporteur, the Commission' s proposal does not establish any element of compulsion on the Member States. The sending of data is completely voluntary and failure to do so will only mean that certain financial assistance, which is not very significant anyway, will not be received. In view of our experience of the submission of data in the fisheries sector, as evidenced by the reports on compliance with the MAGPs, I believe that instead of obtaining a full picture of the situation in the sector, we will end up with total confusion. For example, some Member States will provide scientific data but not employment data while others will provide data on employment but none on the situation of resources, according to whether they can or want to obtain and send this data. I am very much afraid that some will prefer to receive no financing rather than reveal their poor management. This has already been seen in cases where the sending of this data was compulsory, as with the MAGPs. In view of this problem, which seems to me to be the most serious, the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal in certain important points, particularly with the rapporteur' s suggestion of more reasonable submission deadlines and the request for monitoring by the Commission. My Group has included two reasonable requests. The first is that data originating from studies and samples should be used as a source of data whose collection could otherwise be interminable. The second is that the requirement for data referring strictly to the taxation of enterprises should be removed from the Commission' s proposal, bearing in mind that this tax data does not come within the Community competence. As a result, this report is very satisfactory and, on behalf of my Group, I therefore ask for its approval. I wish at the outset to congratulate Mrs Attwooll on the preparation and presentation of her report. I welcome the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data which I believe is absolutely essential if we are to properly assess the level of stocks of the various species of fish. It is important, of course, that the data is both of a biological and economic nature and the information to be provided from the various Member States must be standardised across the Community and, as stated by the rapporteur in her report, must be in compliance with international provisions. I welcome the availability of funding for national programmes, even taking into consideration provisions concerning the minimum programmes to be met. I agree with the proposals that information provided to international organisations should also be made available to the Commission. Otherwise the purpose of collecting and collating data would be defeated and if the information is not available then the precautionary approach would continue. Sound, factual information is in the best interests of the industry.	it
- (FR) Women suffer increasingly from inequality since they are the victims of the sexist discrimination which can take an overt form (violence, rape, sexual harassment, domestic violence, etc.) but also a more insidious one. This oppression is based upon a sexual and social division of labour which values men' s work more than women' s. Wages are not equal, women' s work is still perceived as 'stop-gap' work and, more generally, female employees do not have access to the same positions of responsibility as men. What is more, women bear the main responsibility for family matters. Women must be entitled to full time employment on an equal footing with men. Mandatory legislation must be adopted in order to encourage equality in the workplace. States must develop a public service offering childcare for working mothers. Finally, in order to enable everyone, men and women, to become involved in public life, working hours must be drastically reduced. We need real equality between men and women in political, economic and social life. We are opposed to the idea that the biological differences between men and women should give rise to two different world views and two different value systems. Women have the right to be involved in the decision-making process as 'individuals' and not as token females. - I, together with my colleagues in the British Conservative delegation, am totally committed to the need to have more women playing a full and active part in public life. We share in all expressions of regret that there remains inequality and gender discrimination and especially under-representation of women in politics. However, we are not convinced that one form of discrimination should be countered with another form of discrimination, namely the introduction of quotas to guarantee women elected places. I feel this especially keenly as only on Tuesday evening of this week my 27-year-old daughter, Caroline, was selected as the prospective Conservative candidate for the Southampton Itchen constituency in the United Kingdom. She achieved this position totally on her own merit and in open competition against all-comers. We should not adopt a position that in any way detracts from the position of the increasing number of women who are demonstrating that without fear or favour they can earn their place in public life. For this reason members of my delegation have supported much of the resolution but we registered our opposition to those calls for positive discrimination in favour of women, which we think is the wrong way to make progress, is itself demeaning to women and distorts the democratic process and we have therefore abstained in the final vote. Katiforis report (A5-0041/2000) Mr President, I voted for the Katiforis report on the European Union economy in 1999 to toe the group line, and also because it reveals an extremely serious deficiency which I hope it will contribute to eliminating during the next few years. However, the report does not fully explain, or rather it does not explain at all, that the economies of the States of the Union also and, above all, depend on the way in which pension contributions paid by workers are used.	fr
If we allow Europe to be watered down as a result of enlargement, we will drown in our own political quagmire. Mr President, there are days when I really cannot understand this Parliament. It seems to take a masochistic pleasure in self-mutilation. After having restricted, on its own initiative, its participation in the IGC to two minor seats, Parliament is now giving up the right to add to the agenda for this IGC. The fact is, whether through weakness or foolishness - nothing to be proud of either way, you will admit - in rushing to give its opinion, Parliament is giving up the only lever which the Treaty accords it, i.e. demanding a complete IGC agenda as a prerequisite before declaring its opinion. Why do we have to vote on this opinion tomorrow, 3 February, as a matter of urgency, when we could wait, in a position of strength, until the opening of the Strasbourg part-session on 14 February, and thus force an agenda that is complete, and therefore consistent, on the Council. A good dose of hypocrisy is needed to overlook our weakness today. Hypocrisy to be regretted bitterly, in our resolution, that the agenda for the IGC is not equal to the issues, since in our haste, with blameworthy naivety, we are stopping ourselves forcing through this more ambitious agenda. If there is a democratic deficit at the end of this IGC, then I say that the political groups which so wanted this haste will be accountable for this. Whether we want it or not, since Parliament itself is going to extinguish the only spotlight capable of shedding a little light on the debates, the venue for decisions is now going to move to the 15 Member States of the Union. I therefore invite the Members of Parliament who form the great majority, those who last November ruled that the future of Europe was deserving of debates that went far wider than the Amsterdam leftovers, to take up their pilgrims' staffs and go and convince their own governments that this IGC must be extended, since this is permitted according to the resolution of the Helsinki Council. Because of the situation in Austria, this is a dark day for Europe. It makes us realise that the victory of democracy is never definitive, and that we have to work to convince and keep on convincing. In order to assert our fundamental values, they need to be laid down in writing, as a matter of urgency, and, beyond this IGC, I believe we owe Europe a constitution. Mr President, the draft resolution we are now discussing requires, precisely as before, that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference should have a broad agenda involving radical reforms of the institutions. The forthcoming enlargement of the Union is used as an argument for this. I am convinced that this is an error of judgement. A federal and centralist EU which intervenes more and more in the government of the Member States is in actual fact less well placed for enlargement. A flexible EU which concentrates on fewer but important areas and which respects national differences and national democracy has a better chance of embracing a significantly greater number of countries.	es
Throughout this conference, ladies and gentlemen, it is not only the status of the negotiators which is important, but the quality of what they will be saying. And once again I should like to point out in this House, in view of my own experience prior to Amsterdam, that whatever the ambiguity or weakness of the status acknowledged to the two representatives of the European Parliament, prior to Amsterdam, the quality of what Mrs Guigou and Mr Brok said counted for a lot in these negotiations. I am sure that the situation will be just the same and, as far as I am concerned, in my current position, I shall ensure that the contributions of your two representatives are listened to and respected throughout these negotiations. I am sure that in this way the European Parliament will not be just an observer at these negotiations any more than the Commission will be. We now await, therefore, with great interest, ladies and gentlemen of the House, your next opinion, in which you will specify Parliament' s priorities and practical proposals for these negotiations. It is extremely important that the two European institutions involved in these negotiations, the Commission on the one hand and Parliament on the other, alongside the Council members, explain clearly to the citizens of the Union continually, every day, what the issues of this conference are and what responses we advocate in our capacity as European institutions responsible for ensuring both the proper operation of this enlarged Union and the common interest. In the coming months, ladies and gentlemen of the House, the Commission will therefore be working in close cooperation, on good terms, with your two representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Mr Elmar Brok, in order to reconcile our points of view, if need be. Quite probably, our points of view and our positions will not always be the same. There will probably be differences of opinion, that would be only normal. The important thing is that we are consistent, and I have been committed to working towards this consistency ever since I accepted the position of Commissioner. Our concern and our ambition, therefore, on a large number of subjects, is to be on the same wavelength and to carry these negotiations forward successfully. This will not be a matter of chance, since, let me repeat, I feel we have the same ambitions for these negotiations and that together we see it as a moment of truth for the European Union. Finally, I should like to make three additional comments, quite briefly, Mr President. Firstly, to congratulate and thank Mr Napolitano, the chairman, and the Committee on Constitutional Affairs for the extremely original major initiative which it took yesterday in bringing together the competent representatives of national parliaments, the Committee on Constitutional Affairs and the Commission for an initial joint debate. Such dialogue between the national parliaments, the European Parliament and ourselves is extremely important. I have said, furthermore, that I would play my part by visiting each of the national parliaments.	fr
If those amendments were adopted which would considerably weaken the directive, this would be very detrimental, not only from an environmental point of view but also for the European Parliament' s credibility on environmental issues. Reference was made earlier on in the debate to the fact that some thought should be given to the millions of people who work in the car industry in various countries and to those countries which have large car industries, for example my own country, Sweden. I was myself a car worker before I was elected. I believe I am one of the few members of this Parliament to have stood beside a production line and assembled cars. I think that very tough demands should be made of the car industry. These would, of course, be to the advantage of modern, progressive car manufacturers who think in environmentally friendly terms. It is precisely this type of car industry which we should be encouraging in the European Union. Mr President, I am very pleased that environmental protection is now a priority for this Parliament, as indeed it is for the citizens of Europe. There is no doubt that abandoned cars represent a serious threat to the visual and physical environment. Our citizens expect us in this regard to protect their interests. Each year, there are between 8 and 9 million vehicles scrapped within the European Union. This in itself generates a large amount of waste. Car manufacturers, the suppliers of materials and equipment manufacturers must make an effort to limit the use of hazardous substances and therefore must ensure at the design stage that recycled materials can be used in the manufacture of cars. We know that in the Netherlands there are authorised treatment centres in place to collect end-of-life vehicles and this process should be extended across the length and breadth of the European Union. From an Irish perspective, I know that the Irish Department of the Environment is already having consultations with motor industry representatives to ensure that appropriate collection centres are put in place in Ireland in the near future to deal with end-of-life vehicles. I see no reason why licensing arrangements cannot be organised across Europe for collection centres to scrap the 8 to 9 million vehicles which are disposed of within the European Union on an annual basis. Car manufacturers will have to provide information on the rate of re-use, recycling and recovery of used cars which will be achieved in the coming years. In accordance with new provisions included in the Amsterdam Treaty all the 370 million consumers within the European Union have a right to consumer-related information. I believe EU consumers will support those car manufacturers that incorporate the most environmentally-friendly practices in the coming year. My final point is that the regulations and the legislation must take into account the special position of the vintage car sector throughout the European Community because of its role in relation to the social sector and its environmental and economic considerations. Mr President, the directive on end-of-life vehicles is certainly a milestone in the improvement of the environment in Europe. I also think that a great effort has been made to arrive at intelligent recycling of materials, a reduction of polluting waste and the promotion of technological innovation. In this regard, we are certainly on the right track, but as some Members have already stressed, the real issue here is the possibility that manufacturers' responsibility will become a shared responsibility.	de
Mr Rübig has the floor. Mr President, fourteen Member States have imposed bilateral sanctions on another Member State, because a democratically elected government was formed there. Both parties were once part of the government. So far there have been no infringements of the law. Are preventive sanctions reconcilable with the Charter of Human Rights? Would a right of veto on the part of the President-in-Office of the Council, in respect of the formation of national governments, be reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Is the call for violent demonstrations reconcilable with the Charter of Fundamental Rights? Mr Rübig, as President-in-Office, I cannot give you an answer for the simple reason that the statement by the Portuguese Prime Minister on behalf of the fourteen Heads of State and Government of the Member States of the European Union was adopted bilaterally and not by him in his capacity as President-in-Office of the Council of the European Union. Nevertheless, I would like to say that the various preventive actions taken on a strictly bilateral basis by these Member States was actually a set of actions of what I would call preventive political action at diplomatic level. We feel that they were perfectly justified and seemed to be reasonable in the face of the actions and personalities of a party which, although it has become part of a European Union government, does not strike us as being able to guarantee that it can meet the Union' s aims. I do not wish to dwell on this subject on behalf of the Council presidency, because my government intervened at the request of, and in conjunction with, fourteen Member States and not in its presidency capacity. Mr President, I have the honour of being a member of the Convention drafting the Charter so I am not going to ask the presidency to speculate on the contents or whether it thinks the Convention should be declaratory or whether it should have judicial force. What I would like to know is what will happen to the draft Charter that the Convention draws up? Will the Council treat it as a document that it has to accept as it stands, or will the Council feel free to amend that document? Will the Council say just simply yes or no to it or will it be in a position to actually then redraft that draft Charter? - (PT) The answer is neither yes nor no. I do not know, Mr Martin. It will depend on the decision taken by the Council. Question No 8 by (H-0042/00): Subject: Granting of export credit guarantees and its implications for the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 meeting in Cologne called on the OECD to set up a process for the establishment of common standards for the granting of export credits. These can be used to distort competition and support questionable projects. Will the EU take the lead in advancing this process? The need was demonstrated recently by the statement from the British Government that it is 'minded to grant' an export credit licence to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey.	fr
Subsidiarity must be seen to apply: it must be clear that we are not legislating where it is not necessary to do so. The second concern relates to budgets. Given the higher growth rate than was predicted in the financial perspectives, which are based on 2.5% growth, we can see our way forward to taking slightly different measures on budgets than we would otherwise have done. On behalf of my group I would like to caution the Commission not to go ahead at this stage with shifting agricultural expenditure from category 1 to category 4. In Britain in particular we have a farming industry which is in desperate straits and wants to see some assistance given to certain sectors of agriculture: shifting money for agriculture from one part of the budget to another at this stage would be to give them a wrong message. Lastly, a word of caution about the question of information. This is what bedevilled the relationship between our Parliament and the previous Commission: the fact that we, under the Treaties, have access and the right of access to all information in principle. It looks as if we are running into difficulties with our framework agreement. I therefore stress that, if we want to have the Commission and Parliament working together, we have to be able to come up with a solution to this problem as soon as possible and not to have limitations on documents which are available to citizens. As Mr Bonde rightly pointed out, we should have a European Union where there is a free flow of information from the bureaucracy to all our citizens. Mr President of the Commission, when you entered upon your duties, you said that the Commission would be characterised by openness. A lot of other people have also said that here today. But what is the situation now? Why are the Commission' s press conferences no longer being broadcast directly via satellite television so that everyone in all parts of Europe can follow what is happening? I hope that Mr Prodi is listening. Regarding your letter to Mrs Fontaine about the ombudsman, Mr Prodi, do you consider that the ombudsman is bound by any principle of loyal cooperation between the institutions? Where, in that case, do you find a legal basis for this view, and do you believe that such a principle can suppress the ombudsman' s right to express himself freely in the press? I also want to provide the following piece of information about your letter to the Wall Street Journal, in which you refer to a seminar in April on openness as proof that the regulation concerned has been prepared openly. That seminar was, in fact, organised by the European Federation of Journalists and by MEPs Lööw, Thors, Hautala and others, but the proposal which was discussed there had nothing to do with the current proposal, which has been prepared very much in secret. The main question, however, is that of whether the principle of loyal cooperation should take precedence over the right to express oneself. Where is the basis for a principle in accordance with which you could suppress this right and make such demands upon the ombudsman? Mr President, the report you have presented is ambitious and complex, and I will only touch on a few points.	de
Why would I not say that we have noticed in previous years, on the part of the Greek Government, some shortcomings in the application of the new Regulation and the previous regulation in terms of involving representatives of civil society? I am saying this objectively and when a problem or shortcoming is noted, this must be remedied. I will therefore monitor this in the implementation of the new Community support framework. - Question No 45 by (H-0041/00): Subject: Structural Fund financing of research in the civil nuclear technology field Can the Commission confirm that in the last Structural Fund programming period, 1994-1999, no assistance was granted to research in the nuclear fusion or fission areas? Can it also undertake to rule out any measures providing financing for research of this type during the negotiations in progress with the Member States on the plans and programmes for the new 2000-2006 period? What role will aid from the Structural Funds play, on the other hand, in the promotion of renewable energy? Can we expect that Structural Fund financing relating to energy policy will focus on the promotion of regional, renewable energy sources? Will the Structural Funds also finance the large-scale energy transmission networks? On Mrs Isler Béguin' s first point I must remind her that the improvement of the scientific basis and technical capacities of the regions in order to increase their competitiveness was one of the Community' s priorities during the previous programming period. The support allocated by the Structural Funds for technological cohesion, or research and technical developments, within the Community support frameworks for that period is estimated at approximately EUR 7.5 billion. This is about 6% of the whole Community contribution. With regard to your specific concern, I can say that, as in the previous period, the Commission does not intend to directly finance through the Structural Funds research and technical development in the area of nuclear fusion or fission. However, it is still the responsibility of the Member States' management authorities to select the projects to be implemented within these CSFs. Consequently, even though this is not a Community priority, a Member State can decide to finance research and development projects in the civil nuclear technology area, provided that these projects contribute to regional development. The Commission does not have to be systematically informed of these. On your second point of renewable energy which, as you know, is of great interest to me, the Commission' s approach is given in the document on the Structural Funds and their coordination with the Cohesion Funds. These Funds specify that investments in the renewable energy sector must be encouraged where they favour the development of local resources, where they contribute to reducing dependency on energy imports and where they create jobs at local level. I was able to verify this, for example, during a visit I made to the Azores in Portugal a few days ago with regard to a natural source of renewable energy. The Structural Funds contribution which has enabled greater penetration of the renewable energy market was also underlined in the campaign to promote renewable energy sources launched by the Transport and Energy Department.	fr
"We have three outstanding problems. The first is the transfer of water between basin areas. That is a matter which affects my colleagues from Spain, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Amendments Nos 4. 49 and 87 would not be acceptable because they would restrict the ability of a country to move water from where it is in supply to where it is needed, be that arid areas or urban areas. Secondly, we have to have realistic targets, but targets nevertheless. Looking at Amendment No 7, for example, which calls for the complete elimination of naturally occurring substances, you can see that some of the targets set are unrealistic. Also, some of the targets which are set at close to zero - in English, that is quite a meaningless term. We need to look very carefully at those. The concept of continuing reduction as in Amendment No 58 is much better. Thirdly, I raise the problem faced by Scotch whisky. Scotch whisky - especially malt whisky, which is the best - requires water extraction which is used in some quantity and then returned to the water stream. Some of it ends up in the bottle and is drunk. We must make sure that Amendments Nos 49 and 87 leave the deletion exemption so that whisky can continue to be drunk in ""high quality"", which means it must use good, Scottish peat water. That is my third request - that we look carefully at these measures before passing this measure as a whole. Mr President, first of all, we want to denounce the fathomless hypocrisy of those who claim to be concerned about the environment and water, but whose criminal activities such as the attacks against Yugoslavia, aside from leaving thousands dead and wounded, have also brought about huge ecological disasters for water resources too, making them not only unusable but even extremely hazardous. Turning to the report, we believe that implementing the principle that the cost of water services should be recoverable must never result in additional taxation of the economically weakest strata, or even in the annihilation of small and medium-scale farmers because of the prohibitive cost of water for irrigation. We also wish to point out that especially in areas with acute drought problems such as my own country, and especially on the islands, funding must be provided for infrastructure for the saving of water, by increasing not its cost but its quantity. This should mainly be carried out by collecting the rainwater that now goes to waste, running off into the sea and eroding the soil, with all the problems that creates. In that spirit, we support Amendment No 107 by Mr Marset Campos. River waters must also be used more effectively so as to preserve life in areas that suffer chronic drought. Finally, as regards the Council' s allegation, which the Commission echoes, that there is no need for many specific references and explanations because they are covered by the examples given in the directive or contained elsewhere therein, this is chicanery. Its purpose is to preserve a semi-transparent field of action, which during the directive' s first implementation period will allow critical choices to be finalised to the benefit of big business."	de
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct. It is easy to counterfeit the euro. We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history. It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence. It is a highly complex problem. If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation. Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people. So what is the European Union doing about it? It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied. The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy. We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment. Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months. It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken. On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us. So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this. We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure. This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress. Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	de
Quite clearly, we are now paying the price for our lack of concern. Because our states, with the blessing of the Community, did not deem it useful to have its own commercial fleet and allowed meticulous shipbuilding know-how to disappear, we no longer have access to the clear traceability of vessels and we can see veritable coffin ships navigating our waters under flags of convenience, drifting according to the short-term interests of the multinationals. It is absolutely essential to put an end to this floodtide of irresponsibility, irresponsible charterers, untraceable shipowners and lenient certification companies. So today we find ourselves in a state of utter confusion. Obviously, such matters should be handled at world level, but the current international regulations of the IMO are far from adequate and are far too loose, and neither our own countries nor the Community have tried determinedly to make them stricter, despite previous disasters. Admittedly, there is the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, IOPCF, but it waters down the issue of liability and sets its ceiling at a quite inadequate level, which must be reviewed. The question of flags of convenience must be reviewed within the IMO. It is up to the Members States and the Community to take the necessary initiatives to achieve this. Let me remind you that the Erika was sailing under a flag of convenience, that of a state applying for membership of the European Union. In addition, there are Community directives, but they are seldom applied, if at all, due to the insufficient number of national inspectors. This omission must be remedied as a matter of urgency. A directive on maritime safety has been in preparation for many years, but it is making very slow progress. The Commission is displaying intolerable inertia and unacceptable shortcomings. The date when the Commission is supposed to present its communication devoted to this key issue is put off time and again. It is now scheduled for July. This must be brought forward. The terms of the regulations to be enforced must be particularly clear and strict. I shall mention three issues that our group feels are priorities. Firstly, the liability of owners of oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of pollution incidents must be able to claim on this liability unequivocally. The best form of prevention we can offer for the future is the sure knowledge we can offer charterers that they will be heavily penalised in civil, criminal and financial terms if they are not extremely vigilant regarding the matter of the safety of the vessels they select. Secondly, the requirement of the double hull as a condition for access to Community waters must be enforced as soon as possible and cease to be put off indefinitely. Thirdly, a strict age limit on vessels to be given access to Community waters must be established in the near future. This could be of a maximum of 15 years of age. If we do not obtain a framework of Community regulations which is sufficiently clear, strict and trenchant, then those Member States that wish to do so must be allowed to take the necessary steps to protect their people and their territory, in the same way that the United States succeeded in learning the lessons of the Exxon Valdez disaster by making double hulls compulsory and banning all vessels more than 20 years old from their waters. Thus, the Erika was refused access to American waters.	it
In the new programme submitted for the period from 2000 to 2006, which is being financed from the Social Fund, both the resources and the policies should be used, with the Commission' s support, to implement the objectives which I referred to earlier. The Commission will keep a close watch on the Greek Government in order to ensure that it honours the commitments which it has made. Thank you, Commissioner for your reply. However, our current situation is as follows: at 11.3%, we have the second highest unemployment in Europe, which was not previously the case, we have the biggest increase in unemployment, we spend less than anyone else on the unemployed, i.e. less than 1% of GDP, while other countries, such as France, Belgium and Germany spend 3-4%, and it is not clear how the money received from the Social Fund has been used, inter alia, to combat unemployment. You tell me that you, as the Commission, have made recommendations. I understand and welcome that and I hope that the recommendations will be adhered to. However, my question for a very long time has been this: what happened with previous policies? Did anyone find work? How many people found work? If you cannot tell us for this year, then last year and the year before. What has been done about training? Is the purpose of the famous training centres to provide jobs for instructors or trainees? Do we have any figures? In other words, do we have ways of checking what is happening with this government policy in Greece? Mr Papayannakis, the only answer I can give you is that the Greek Government does indeed need to step up efforts to introduce computerised statistical records and to set up structures so that the programmes implemented have the quantitative results which you mentioned, and so that monitoring can be carried out and used as a basis for formulating policies. Greece has seen an increase in the employment rate and, as far as I can see, an increase in productivity. The action which the Commission can take relates to the specific guidelines. As you know, there are 22 guidelines on which each country is evaluated. They concern access to training, the ratio of men to women with access to training, and special action for the long-term unemployed. The Commission will endeavour, for all these specific guidelines, to quantify the data and to obtain specific information based on the implementation of the new Community framework for 2000 to 2006. Question No 36 by (H-0782/99): Subject: Danish early retirement pension scheme Will the Commission state whether the Danish early retirement pension scheme has been approved in its entirety and whether there are disagreements between Denmark and the Commission in other areas of social policy? The Danish pension scheme, the Efterløn, only allows people resident in Denmark and people who have completed the required period of employment in Denmark to retire. Some workers have complained to the European Commission because they do not have the right to retire. The Danish authorities do not consider that they are obliged under Community law to pay this compensation to workers taking early retirement who do not meet the conditions required under Danish law.	de
The stumbling block in the negotiations with the Council lies, of course, in the amount of the total appropriation allocated for the third phase of the LIFE programme (2000-2004). The Commission proposal, ratified by the Council, is for EUR 613 million, whilst the Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Protection considers that the budget should be EUR 850 million. I support Mrs Lienemann' s firm stance. The financial allocation has not in fact been upgraded since the programme was created, even when the membership of the EC was increased to fifteen Member States following enlargement. If the report is adopted in plenary session, then conciliation proceedings will have to be opened, in accordance with the codecision procedure, in order to solve the problem of the amount of appropriations earmarked for the programme. This type of procedure is common practice since the programmes or legislative measures are too often allocated budgets which do not live up to their ambitions! Böge report (A5-0023/2000) . (FR) As an MEP and, more importantly, as a consumer, I welcome the European Commission' s proposal as a step in the direction of enhanced food safety within the European Union. This proposal has two objectives: first, to amend the 1991 Council Directive on animal health conditions by removing the provisions on scrapie and, secondly, to introduce a new regulation establishing rules for preventing and combating transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSE) or BSE-type diseases affecting sheep and other animal species. What is interesting abut this new legislation is that a specific legal basis is being created in order to combat scrapie. What is even more satisfactory is that this was one of our main demands in our follow-up report on the mad cow crisis. I also consider it essential, for the sake of coherence, that existing legislation on scrapie, which is limited to the trade in ovine and caprine animals, should be incorporated in a single and complete set of new rules on TSE affecting all animals throughout the European Union, rules designed to prevent the consumption of foodstuffs or feedingstuffs. These rules are all the more welcome in that doubts still persist as regards scrapie. A number of scientific hypotheses maintain that scrapie developed into BSE in cows and therefore caused the BSE epidemic. Even if this proposal for a European Parliament and Council regulation to prevent and combat certain TSE needs to be made more accurate and more effective, especially as regards detecting and fighting scrapie, it is still a notable improvement. It is a pledge to European citizens, who have voiced their concern, as regards European food policy, on many occasions. The European Parliament has relayed their concerns and they have been heard. As a result of the debates on the principle of precaution, traceability, responsibility and transparency, the European Commission has presented a White Paper on food safety. This White Paper sets out several areas of concern and proposes the creation of an independent European Food Authority as part of a European strategy to restore consumer confidence.	fr
Mr President, I would like to thank Commissioner Patten very much for the awareness he has demonstrated of the difficulties inherent in the peace process and the challenge that the European Union is taking on to bring it to completion. It is high time there was peace in the Middle East. It is time to end the era which began with the Balfour declaration in 1917 and the Arab-Israeli war of 1948. It is time there were secure borders and political, social and economic rights in every country in this region, and that human rights were recognised and upheld in Syria, Palestine, Israel and everywhere else. This is an exercise in sovereignty, and in democracy for each population and every individual, but to this end it is vital for all parties in the conflict to have the courage to strive for peace and rights, and to recognise the other as its partner and not as its subject to whom concessions must be given. I refer principally to the Palestine-Israel question, but the same also applies to the territories which have been occupied in the Golan since 1967 and in southern Lebanon since 1982. Israel has to accept its responsibilities, withdraw from the occupied territories and share its water resources but, at the same time, it has to be sure that it will be safe and able to live in peace in terms of economic and political relations with all the countries in the area. However, Israel is not the only country concerned with security. The same goes for the other countries, especially for the Palestinians, who are still living under military occupation and whose land even today is still confiscated in areas B and C, despite the Oslo Agreement and subsequent agreements. Between the period when the Oslo Agreement was signed and 17 October 1999, 174 000 dunams of land were confiscated, 8 462 of which have been taken under Mr Barak' s Government. Trees have been uprooted, houses are still being demolished and, above all, water supplies have been reduced or refused, especially in East Jerusalem, while the settlements continue and are growing constantly. Nevertheless, there is no doubt that with the election of the new government, positive steps have been taken: negotiations, at least, have resumed. But in the Middle East, there can be no stable and lasting peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state, if they cannot move freely within their own territory. All the international community has to do is implement Resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194. We are concerned by the deferment of the building of relations with Syria, as well as Mr Barak' s decision to postpone the withdrawal of the Israeli army and the Sharm el­-Sheikh agreements. We feel it is extremely important for the European Union to play a political role in negotiations which matches its economic aid. We cannot be content with a role backstage. We must be leading protagonists while staying off a collision course with the United States, as Minister Gama said.	fr
One gets the impression in fact that they both think that the Petersberg tasks are ideally suited for inclusion in the EU defence policy in due course. The Treaties also point in that direction, although they allow for a more general defence policy which ties in more with the traditional line of thought of incorporating our policy into a European pillar. We would then have a voice in NATO through this European pillar. Actually, I hear less and less about this. I am under the impression that the European Union has pared its ambitions down to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr Patten taking responsibility for civil affairs, which would include a police and diplomatic corps capable of being swiftly deployed, about which he has talked with enthusiasm, and rightly so, and Mr Solana taking care of the deployment of military troops and military equipment. It seems evident that they would do this in joint cooperation, which would work very well. But is there not more to it than that? I cannot shake off the impression that in terms of defence policy, NATO' s role is actually very much emphasised with regard to collective defence. The European pillar does not really function any more as such. Europe is not venturing beyond the Petersberg tasks. Is this actually how we want things done? Moreover, whilst there may be talk of integrating the Western European Union into the European Union, there is no longer any mention of Article V, which is, of course, of direct concern to us. Article V touches upon the wider defence tasks and not just Petersberg. Will it be omitted? At the same time, an appeal has also been made in broad terms to increase the defence budgets. I think that this is to be welcomed, but this appeal does not really distinguish very clearly between Petersberg tasks and wider, collective defence tasks. I wonder how this will develop. I would like to ask both gentlemen how they view the long-term future. Is it necessary to give further attention to this during the IGC or will the Treaties inevitably set the ball rolling? I am pleased that this has opened a few matters up in relation to defence policy. I do wonder, if Turkey were to bring in a brigade, would we also have to grant it codecision rights concerning that policy? The fabric of Turkey' s government contains a few Haider-type personalities. That would seem odd to me. Secondly, the Baltic States are also knocking on our door. Will they also take part in our defence policy? It is a very interesting position to be in, to say the least. High Representative, you have efficiently drawn our attention to the progress we made in this field between Amsterdam and Helsinki and to certain decisions which have already been taken since Helsinki, such as the establishment of the three committees and, of course, the decision to provide for the deployment of a 50-60 000-strong military force. However, this increase in pace accentuates the lack of coordination between these decisions and the on-going Intergovernmental Conference even further.	fr
"Of course, we must take due note of the issue of competitiveness, but social protection too must be planned in a way that makes it a factor of economic growth and employment. I think the statement' s content makes this clear. Ladies and gentlemen, the aim is that in the next year, and after a unanimous decision by the Council, we should progress to a first level of coordination, exchange of views, listing of social problems and creation of a data base for the better coordination of policies. As many of the speakers have said, I believe a first important step has been taken. Already at the Intergovernmental Conference, social policy issues are being addressed more broadly and I believe we are in a new phase, in which social policy will, to a large extent, become a European policy. Thank you, Mrs Diamantopoulou. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. WIPO treaty The next item is the recommendation (A5-0008/2000) by Mrs Cederschiöld, on behalf of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, on the proposal for a Council Decision on the approval, on behalf of the European Community, of the WIPO Copyright Treaty and the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty [COM(1998) 249 - C5-0222/1999 - 1998/0141 (AVC)]. Mr President, we are now taking a stance on an important issue, an international agreement, which may influence the prospects for prosperity of many Member States. In my own country, Sweden, one of our biggest export industries is affected, namely the music and sound recording industry. It is about artists' entitlement to copyright or to protection for their artistic products. It is about the WCT (World Copyright Treaty) and the WPPT (World Performance and Phonograms Treaty). Without protection under intellectual property law, creativity is inhibited and financial incentives obstructed. Forgeries are big business. It is estimated that, in Europe alone, income of EUR 4.5 billion is lost because of piracy. The problem affects a lot of jobs in the entertainment industry. This is an historic agreement because the EU is the contracting party. This is the case, in spite of the fact that it is not the EU, but only the Member States, which belong to the organisation. There exists a special clause which requires Parliament' s assent in two cases. With regard to the present agreement, both these conditions are fulfilled. A new institution is being created, an assembly which, in the future, will monitor the agreement and its consequences. The agreement also concerns questions dealt with in accordance with the co-decision-making procedure. Parliament must therefore give its assent, because the agreement concerns its sphere of competence. The future will show whether it is right, by means of this new parliamentary assembly, to reduce the Commission' s powers regarding these issues. Parliament cannot, in any case, at present do anything about the matter. The agreement complements the Berne Convention in regard to literary works. It creates international legal protection in connection with distribution, sale, rental, public reproduction and the making available of works. It also creates protection for software and databases. There are problems regarding the term ""author"" . For example, it has not been defined. Another issue, which is somewhat problematic, is that of intermediate storage. This too has not been solved. It is dealt with by means of a general clause which does not provide any definition."	de
When the USA and NATO and, finally, also the EU, reacted, it was already late, in fact very late. A great deal of suffering could have been avoided if the EU, among others, has acted earlier and more decisively. We, the European Union, therefore have a special responsibility to help, support and rebuild the Balkans now. Our absolute objective must be to create the prior conditions for all countries in south-east Europe to be integrated with other countries in the EU - economically, politically and in terms of trade. Fertile soil for the growth of democracy in this war-ravaged part of Europe is best provided through trade and economic integration. We Liberals are prepared to go a long way and to do so quickly, just as Paolo Costa reported. It is therefore with great satisfaction that we welcome the proposal that is now being made for a stabilisation and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank Mr Swoboda for a very good report. Macedonia deserves our support, especially in view of the self-sacrificial, disinterested work which the people and leaders of Macedonia undertook during the Kosovo war. Now that Macedonia is prising itself loose from the crushing embrace of Communism and nationalism, it is our duty to act and provide support in no uncertain terms. We should do exactly the same for the other countries in the Balkans. This is an urgent duty for the EU. Mr President, allow me in this context to remind MEPs - especially in view of a discussion earlier this evening - of the fact that the man who is mainly responsible for war, human degradation, murder and driving innocent people from their homes is still governing what remains of Yugoslavia, namely Serbia. The man who is accused of genocide and who ought to be brought before the war crimes tribunal in the Hague still goes free. I am talking about Milosevic. As long as Milosevic is still there and Serbia is not pursuing a democratic path, Serbia constitutes a constant threat to peace throughout the Balkans, including in Macedonia. Mr President, the agreement being promoted will be the first application of the Stability Pact in south-eastern Europe, Its terms, which the Swoboda report accepts, are certainly not directed towards peace, but towards greater political and economic dominance of the country, and towards controlling its natural wealth, overexploiting its workforce and continuing to use that country as a springboard against the countries and peoples in the area who are resisting the new order. All this, in exchange for the promise of future accession to the European Union. The report accepts these attitudes along with the more general policy of the European Union on south-eastern Europe. It is characteristic that the report congratulates FYROM on the constructive stance it maintained during the NATO attack, eulogises its pacifist role because it allowed its territory to be used as a base for NATO forces, but, of course, remains silent about the indignation of its people, which was manifested by mass demonstrations during the NATO bombardments.	fr
The answer is a lot. Mr President of the Commission, on reading your White Paper on the reform of the Commission, it is clearly apparent that the guiding principle, the philosophy behind this reform, is something very vague which we cannot accept in this Parliament. This guiding principle is mainly the protection of the Community' s financial interests. That is clearly of concern to all of us, but it is only a starting point. From there on, the Commission must begin to work, and must fulfil its obligations in accordance with the Treaty. Allow me to give you an example, since the speaking time allotted to me does not give me much opportunity to expand on this idea. Let us consider the intended reform of the infringement procedure. What is the intention there? It is simply to administrate the existing resources on each level, instead of hearing this Parliament' s demand that we should create a genuine administrative procedural law for ensuring legal certainty, which is necessary from the point of view of the European citizen, that is to say, from the point of view of the people who may have recourse to this infringement procedure. It is simply said that this administrative procedural law will not be created, but rather demands will be selected. How can this be? How can these things be selected in a purely arbitrary way. From the point of view of this Parliament, this type of arrangement cannot be allowed. We understand that the Commission has to be reformed. We agree with the objectives of this reform. However, it should not lead to the abandonment of the great momentum of European construction, for the sake of protecting the Community' s financial interests, however important we may all agree that that is. The Treaty obliges the Commission, primarily, to provide that momentum. Thank you, Mr Prodi, for your presentation and your documentation. Congratulations on using the Internet for the general public - a very good idea. I will start with trade. We agree with you that we need a rules-based trading system. It is essential. Seattle failed because the United States, in particular, appeared unable to grasp the legitimacy of policies such as environmental protection, the preservation of rural communities through the common agricultural policy, animal welfare, health concerns and social rights. It displayed incredible insensitivity to the legitimate concerns of the developing world and, frankly, the developing world has little so far to thank the WTO for. We expect the European Union to continue negotiations, maintaining our strong positions on all these issues and using our links with countries in the developing world to ensure that the next round is a fair round. Please, can we have detailed proposals in the next three months about how this will happen. Innovation and knowledge - very appropriate for a new century. How much innovation has taken place in the Commission, or indeed in the Parliament may I say? We had a White Paper on innovation some years ago - what has happened since? One thing I would like to say very strongly is that we are very concerned in follow-up, not simply in excellent communications, which we welcome, but in follow-up, follow-up, follow-up!!!!	de
I think that in institutional terms, it is an extremely serious matter that we are moving towards replacing collegiate decisions, which the European Union is bound to observe under the Treaty, by means of bilateral decisions between governments. I am not talking about the causes of the Austrian issue. I am talking about the serious precedent that we might be setting if today we replace the collegiate procedure stipulated in the Treaties by means of bilateral decisions, in this case aimed at one particular country, because tomorrow we might adopt the same approach towards a different country or countries. That is my first question. My second question is about the Employment Summit. I firmly believed, particularly because I attended the discussions on including the employment problem on the Council agenda, and on the European Union agenda, that the original idea of the Employment Summit was to combat the problems, not of the new knowledge-based economy, but of the old European economy, the problems of unemployment in factories, dockyards, iron and steelworks, and that these were the employment problems which were originally due to be on the Employment Summit agenda. It is therefore perfectly reasonable to raise the question of whether, when we talk about the problems of the new knowledge-based economy and of the new digital economy, which, as far as I know have created unemployment rather than employment in Europe, we are not replacing an inability to deal with the problems of unemployment in the present by what has largely been - and still is today - empty rhetoric about the problems of employment in the future... No one understands better than us the crucial role that the Internet, the digital economy and the knowledge-based economy have to play, but these issues were not what the Employment Summit was originally intended for. Mr President-in-Office, you concluded on a vaguely ideological note, which is fair enough. If this is the Social Democrats' policy for the economy of the future, then I would like to remind you that one of the most serious problems of the Internet economy and Europe' s lagging behind is the lack of entrepreneurial spirit in the education system, in the behaviour of governments and in the way the institutions function. This is what we must counter if we are to guarantee the knowledge-based economy of the future. Mr President-in-Office, first of all, I would like to welcome you to the European Parliament, particularly as your presence here symbolises what the Chairman of the Group of the Party of European Socialists has already referred to. By that I mean the political symbolism of the fact that during your tour of the capitals, you have also come to listen to the European Parliament. This is not the first time during the Portuguese Presidency that there has been a different and politically stimulating relationship between the Council and Parliament, but this is a significant gesture which, as my friend and colleague Mr Barón Crespo noted, we were delighted to note. Our position is clear: we support the Portuguese Government' s initiative. We support it because it is a serious initiative and because of its substance, both in terms of strategic objectives and in terms of other objectives with which we agree.	es
They should also be pursued in the context of the bilateral and multilateral agreements which the Community negotiates. Whilst the communication reveals the Commission' s worthy intentions in this field, it is also revealing as to what activity is lacking and where management and control improvements can be made. One can quote from the communication. Over-exploitation is so severe in Community fisheries that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions of the exploitation levels of up to 40 percent. That appeared in the communication published last July. Since then, the Fisheries Council meeting of 16 December decided on drastic reductions in the total allowable catches for certain species such as cod and anchovy which were in the region of 25 percent for cod and 43 percent for anchovy for the year 2000. Furthermore, the Commission adopted an emergency regulation for a recovery plan for Irish Sea cod, effectively calling a halt to cod fishing in the Irish Sea between 14 February and 13 April due to the crisis in the species. These are examples of the fishery sector facing severe problems due to over-exploitation. What can be done to alleviate the damage done to fishing communities? The first consideration must be to recognise that Community legislation must be reinforced and control mechanism procedures enhanced. Secondly, the principles of such Community legislation should also be extended to international agreements to which the Community is a party. Thirdly, the European Union should undertake to enhance its monitoring and prevention of extensive pollution prevalent in Community waters and which is harmful to marine life including fishery resources. More controls would be placed to prevent oil spillages such as that of the Erika in the Bay of Biscay and also deliberate dumping of waste oils. Recognition should also be given to the pressures which the delicate marine aqua system faces from urbanisation of coastal areas. Such pressures are greatest in Europe. In this context one can also mention the problems of discards of unwanted catches, fishing gear which destroys the seabed and the destruction of natural habitats by over intensive aquacultures. A quota management system such as that existing in New Zealand since 1986 is one possible alternative. Under this system, and given the total allowable catch for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain area which the rightholders can trade amongst themselves, fish themselves or lease the rights to other fishermen for a certain time. The property right that has been created in such a system is the right to fish - not the fish themselves. Such a market organisation can reap better long-term prospects for the fishing industry. At present dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast ecosystem that is the sea, nor about the multitude of factors which affect the stock of resources in this aqua system. However, we should never blind ourselves to scientific research, we should never cease to gather information, we should never cease to explore improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, we should at least consider policy changes.	es
In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology. In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people. This will therefore be our rule. We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues. I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical. This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27. Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals. It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots. If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity. We will therefore conduct this dialogue with the towns and regions. Mr Berthu, the Helsinki mandate is clear and we are working within this. It specifies that we must deal firstly and as a priority with the three basic issues which were left out in Amsterdam. It also adds related institutional questions and issues which may be included in the negotiations depending on the Portuguese and French presidencies. The Commission is acting correctly if, on a particular point, it believes it must add to its opinion which covers many institutional questions. I am not yet sure that we will do this on Article 7. However, if we do, this will not be solely in response or as a reaction to an economic situation which is sufficiently serious that the fourteen governments of the Union must mobilise together to give their response. We will also do this with regard for the future in general. We will use all the means available to permanently strengthen the community of values which we have been building together since the founding of the Union in 1957, and even before that, on the rubble of the Second World War. Everything which can be done will be useful. I am sure that you and I, Mr Berthu, can at least agree on this.	de
Every time, when we asked why, the reply was the same, 'We cannot release him: he is a war criminal' . In the emotion, pain and fury of the agreements, it was impossible to break the vicious circle of blood and vengeance. If we want to help the Cambodians with the task of reconciliation on which they have embarked, we need to try and sentence those responsible at the highest level and thus exonerate the simple underlings and all those who were willingly or forcibly dragged along behind them. I expect Ta Mok and his main lieutenants to be tried and sentenced by the establishment of a tribunal whose impartiality is guaranteed by the United Nations. This will be the only way for the Cambodians to pardon those who simply followed them and to achieve lasting peace. Mr President, it became known this week that two prominent Cambodian opposition papers have been threatened with closure because they are reported to have insulted the king and prime minister. These papers actively support the opposition politician, Mr Sam Rengie. Legal proceedings have been initiated against Sam Rengie himself in order to lift his parliamentary immunity so that he can be brought to trial for treason. In his millennium speech, he dared to raise the fact that it should become clear what the procedure would be for appointing the successor to King Sihanouk in the event of his death. In March of last year, a member of Sam Rengie' s party was killed by a group of men in military uniform in the province of Kandal. In September, two members of the party were arrested because they were reported to have been involved in a rocket attack on the prime minister. This is notably the only party in Cambodia which has no military arm. In October, a member of parliament belonging to the same party was abducted by uniformed men and not released until the ransom was paid. The pattern of intimidation is clear. There is more going on in Cambodia: prisoners are being tortured, the army and police are involved in the trade in women and children, and people are held on remand to an excessive degree. All this is happening on a daily basis. Even more serious is the government' s refusal to bring the leaders of the Khmer Rouge before an international tribunal. It is true, the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tension has eased. The way in which the political opposition is now being treated, however, gives us cause for great concern and, if it carries on like this, it is bound to impact on the Union' s relations with Cambodia. Mr President, there is a new doctrine taking shape in international law, according to which no country can treat its citizens or the people living within its territory in any way it likes, and the sovereignty of the state can no longer prevent outside intervention when there are gross violations of human rights, not even when the government is legally or even democratically elected.	es
As for internal reform, you well know how committed my Commission has been to this since day one. I know full well that we will not be able to achieve any political objective if the Commission does not undertake vigorous and comprehensive internal reform, if it does not become more efficient, if it does not increase efficiency in all sectors, starting with the sector in which the worst backlogs have built up in the past - external aid. Providing aid rapidly, when it is needed, saves human lives; in many cases providing it late is worse than not providing it at all. When I speak about external aid, my thoughts immediately turn to the Balkans. There is cause for hope thanks to the commitment of our workers on the ground, an extraordinary commitment given our organisational problems. My thoughts also turn to Bernard Kouchner' s efforts, of the stability pact that we all vigorously support with total dedication, but I also think of new events, such as Croatia, where the situation has changed in a few weeks: the European institutions immediately opened the way to dialogue with this country and received the news knowing full well that the only way to resolve not only Bosnia' s problems, but more particularly Serbia' s problems is to throw a curtain of democracy around Serbia. This is the new element that we must help to bring to the Balkans. We must increase our efficiency in this area. We must reopen the Danube to boats. It is contradictory to offer aid to Romania and Bulgaria yet leave these countries unable to harness their greatest resource. We must decontaminate the river and, in view of this, over the next few days the Commissioner responsible for the environment will be putting forward specific plans to monitor this serious problem. We have done a lot in the Balkans: the new European Reconstruction Agency for Kosovo, the Balkans Task Force and new regulations to speed up procedures. Nevertheless, we definitely have to do more. We must liberalise trade within the region and between the region and the European Union; we must contribute to building infrastructural links that will end its centuries-old isolation; we must intensify efforts to build a democratic, pluralist society in these countries with institutions, public structures, police forces and a structured civil society, but, above all, we must press these countries to work together in the context of a united region, as regards both politics and the economy. If we do not do this, we shall have failed in our duty. Remember that the Marshall Plan was not effective simply because of the scale of its resources: it was even more effective because it made us Europeans work together towards a new horizon; it gave us a fresh outlook in terms of our politics and our economy. This is what we need to do for the Balkans. Europe must prove - in the Balkans and the rest of the world - its ability to extend the area of security, peace and freedom and its ability to take a leading role on the international stage.	fr
And I make the point, before I move to my questions, that what happens concerning the Staff Regulations in the Commission has a fundamental role on our responsibility also as employers of staff because, of course, the European Parliament staff operate under the same conditions. That will form part of the work that we will have to do and I sure that all of you today will want to engage in that process. Now there were two points I wanted to pick up with Mr Kinnock, if I may. The first one concerns the timescale of these important reforms. Mr Prodi said in his very important opening statement that he had identified severe problems in the Commission about low morale and low motivation, and clearly that is a major concern. Big expectations are built up for these reforms both within the Commission and outside. And if we are to move forward, I suggest to you that the reforms on the personnel side, early evidence of change of culture, empowerment and motivation of staff have to happen sooner rather than later. And if we look at the original proposals - and I suspect that we will see the same in the new ones - it was not until 2002 that we were going to complete overall reform of the Staff Regulations. Indeed, it was not until 2001 that some of the key elements of appraisal were going to be introduced. I suggest that is too long, and we really must move forward much more quickly than that. The second point that I want to make concerns information technology. Have you really taken into account the changes in staff structure that new information technology will bring about, because those will be fundamental in the new direction of these reforms. On the second part of Mr Harbour' s question, he will see in the course of this year how with greater precision we will be showing how the application more extensively of information technology will facilitate change, not only in terms of the working practices and conditions of the staff but in the operation of the Commission, as the President briefly outlined in his statement. Could I thank Mr Harbour for the energetic commitment that he has shown to the issue on which he is rapporteur and respond to him by saying that we firmly believe that the morale, the motivation and the professional commitment of Commission officials, which is already very strong, will be enhanced by the introduction of comprehensive training, the allocation of responsibility, the upgrading of management and a number of other changes which we will be introducing. Cultures are products of structures and systems, and the structures and systems have become old. By renovating those structures and systems, in some cases very radically, we will assist the people of the Commission who are strongly committed to the European ideal and have high quality of capability to release talents and manifest themselves as never before. I would like to make one last point in answer to Mr Harbour.	fr
I want, finally, to say that I had certain misgivings last week when we discussed the formation of the Austrian Government but, when it comes to discussing and criticising its policy on refugees, I have no misgivings. I hope that the Chamber will be just as committed this time. Mr President, during the last EU Financial Perspective from 1994 to 1999, when there were 13 different initiatives in operation, the INTERREG II cross-border programme was an important initiative. The fact that the next round of Structural Funds 2000-2006 includes the INTERREG initiative is I believe, a very clear indication of the importance which is attached to it by national EU Member States. The INTERREG I programme between 1989 and 1993 and the INTERREG II programme between 1994 and 1999 have proved an absolute success in terms of bridging closer social and economic development between bordering Member States. Coming from the border counties in the north-west of Ireland, I have seen over the years the important role which INTERREG I and II have played and I am delighted to welcome INTERREG III. The Commission is allocating 67 million pounds towards the INTERREG III programme, which will be spent on continuing the development of cross-border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The European Union has played a key role in developing the border county region in Ireland over the years. The European Union is the single largest contributor, with 80 million pounds to the International Fund for Ireland. The European Union contributes 75% of the Peace and Reconciliation programme. All in all, INTERREG, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation programme have all played an important role in the developing peace process. Mr President, I am taking the floor to speak about INTERREG, but I shall confine myself to a few criticisms, which will clearly also enable me to keep to my speaking time. We have all spoken favourably of this programme' s confirmation and of the extension of the sectors it covers to include the field of transnational and interregional cooperation, in addition to cross-border cooperation. However, this does not blind us to the fact that the majority of resources - 50-80% - will be reserved for cross-border cooperation, for INTERREG IIIA. Therefore, we still think the decision to consolidate the current areas of cooperation in this strand, regarding the selection of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory. We hope that the Commission will want to look into this and acknowledge Parliament' s position in practical terms, and not just with a formal tribute. Cross-border cooperation continues almost exclusively to be an issue concerning landlocked areas and, where exceptions have been made for maritime areas, their selection is not transparent and they often suffer from compensation from other Community policies. This discrimination is much more serious for islands that have a regional status that can only be linked to areas of an exclusively maritime nature. This is in line with ongoing discrimination, which ignores Article 158 of the Treaty on island regions with regard to cohesion policies.	de
We understand that it is important that the two institutions - Parliament and Commission - cooperate and work together and that the current cooperation with the Committee on Regional Policy, and in particular the transport group, is magnificent. The common position includes practically all of the amendments accepted by the Commission and harmonises the minimum examination requirements for safety advisers and, at second reading, we can accept the amendment on the proposed date, which is much more realistic than the one originally suggested by the Commission, bearing in mind that we have now spent several years debating this question. Very briefly, I would like to thank the various Members for their interventions and to tell you that safety is one of the Commission' s priorities in the field of transport. As Mr Simpson has said very correctly, this is a process which we can never take for granted or regard as having come to an end. The process of increasing safety margins and safety guarantees in transport is a process which must be improved day by day. In this regard, I would also like to refer very briefly to the problems of the tunnels, which Messrs Rack and Swoboda have referred to, which, in the case of Austria, is doubtless a very sensitive issue, and great effort should be made to improve their safety. In one of the worst accidents to have occurred recently, the goods being transported were not dangerous in themselves. Margarine and a few kilos of paint which, in principle, do not present risks, led to a genuine disaster. Therefore, we will have to see how the requirements guaranteeing the maximum degree of safety can be further improved. Finally, I would like to say that we have to consider safety in all types of transport. This week we will be holding a debate here on the safety of sea transport, in light of the Erika disaster, and in the course of this year we will have to discuss our objectives in terms of the safety of air transport. But I would like to say that safety is a priority objective for the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika disaster, we do not wait until there is a disaster to deal with the question of safety, but we work on it even when there are no such circumstances, which simply serve to demonstrate the urgency for an effective response to this type of problem. I would like to repeat my appreciation to all the speakers and especially to the rapporteur, Mr Koch. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Transport of dangerous goods by road The next item is the report (A5-0104/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the proposal for a European Parliament and Council directive amending Directive 94/55/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States with regard to the transport of dangerous goods by road [COM(1999) 158 - C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083(COD)].	es
. Could I thank Commissioner Patten for coming here at short notice to respond to our wish to debate this very critical issue and as others have said, the television pictures that we have seen of the stricken Limpopo valley in Mozambique are absolutely heartbreaking. Children have lost parents, families are bereft, hopeless, helpless and they have lost absolutely everything. But of course, as others have said, this whole thing was predicted and predictable and the slow and very inadequate, woefully slow and woefully inadequate response is something that should dictate now that we actually do invest seriously in disaster preparedness. There is a case as the Commissioner mentioned for the implementation of a rapid response facility and rapid response force in situations like this to deal with crises such as we have there because we simply did not have the strategies or the logistical preparations in place. This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region. The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet. 85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is. Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing. Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million. We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there. Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift. As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets. Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources. Are we ready to pay for those resources? Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures. Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured. How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country. Thank you, Mrs Kinnock. Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure. The debate is closed. Union Economy (1999) The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)]. The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001.	it
It is worrying that the bombing has aggravated the situation, and we should recognise that it was a mistake on the part of NATO and the European Union to take such action. I agree with what the Minister very rightly said about the culpability of Belgrade, but we should also remember that the secret services of the USA, Germany, France, Italy and the United Kingdom have been supplying arms and money to the KLA, a mafia, which has contributed to the problems in the area. We are therefore all to blame. I would like to ask him a supplementary question in a wider context. Do you not think that it would be beneficial to lift the embargo on Serbia in order to normalise the area economically and also to benefit Kosovo as a province of Serbia? Mr President, I am no friend of Milosevic or his government. Nevertheless I have the gravest doubts about the legitimacy of Nato's action against Yugoslavia over Kosovo, both in terms of the lack of authority from the UN Security Council and because it could have been avoided by not imposing unacceptable terms on Serbia's sovereignty at Rambouillet. The current situation in Kosovo, which is now ethnically cleansed of Serbs and Roma, speaks for itself. Should Nato not at the very least acknowledge fault for its deliberate targeting of the Belgrade TV tower and killing over 20 civilian journalists, which remains a severe moral blemish on the conduct of the war and now opens the embarrassment of a possible indictment for war crimes against our Western leaders? Mr Tannock, with regard to the position adopted by the European Union, we do not have selective interpretations and analyses of what were military objectives, and in particular of the initiatives taken against certain types of infrastructure that were propping up Mr Milosevic' s political system and acting as propaganda for him. I cannot therefore tell you whether we agreed or not on a specific action carried out by NATO, but it was part of an overall plan with which we do agree. Some of these actions might have been questionable, and some were regarded as unfortunate by NATO itself, but others were justified for tactical reasons, with the aim of preventing Mr Milosevic from continuing his propaganda campaign within the former Yugoslavia. In any event, I, on behalf of the Council, do not wish to make a value judgement about any specific military action carried out by NATO. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, since I know the history of the Balkans, I should like to remind you that, for many decades, the peoples of Yugoslavia lived in peace. Destabilisation began around ten years ago with the break-up of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a decisive part. Yugoslavia' s crime was that it was the only Balkan country that did not ask to become a member either of NATO or of the European Union. So whatever remained standing after the air attacks is now being destroyed by the supposedly disarmed KLA, under the very nose of KFOR, whose role as an occupying force is becoming increasingly apparent.	es
The question for the Commissioner is really whether these principles can actually be applied and whether we will get any money by way of compensation from these people. The second point relates to the future and the publication of the Commission' s White Paper on environmental liability which is designed to ensure that the polluter pays principle applies in future and to ensure that we are better able to enforce European environmental legislation properly. It is recognised in that White Paper that liability is only effective where the polluter can be identified, where the damage can be quantified and where a clear causal connection can be made between the two. The Erika incident could not illustrate the point more clearly because it sums up exactly what that White Paper is seeking to address. This question really would therefore seem to be a perfect measure of how to deal with problems of this kind in future. The proposed directive provides for strict liability for damage caused by EU-regulated dangerous activities and my concern, and perhaps the Commissioner can deal with this, is whether or not the environmental liability paper will be able to deal with problems of the type of Erika in future. Will it really address the concern or will, in practice, in the case of maritime accidents involving ships on the high seas, the polluter once again escape from having to pay for the damage they cause. Mr President, our sympathy and our solidarity go out to those people and regions stricken by the disaster, but good intentions are not enough, there must be compensation for the damage and losses covering both the restoration of the environment and the shellfish farms and fishing equipment. We are pleased to hear the Commissioner announce the urgent need to act and to offer compensation, and for this to be backdated. We also deplore the excessively lax application of vessel inspection, and we are in favour of creating a European coast guard authority, and also, in particular, of introducing more binding regulations and making double hulls mandatory. We further deplore the system of flags of convenience with regard to both merchant vessels and fishing boats. Finally, we were shocked to learn that the cargo was extremely carcinogenic, with a polyaromatic hydrocarbon content of more than 1 000 parts per million. This means that the 15 000 tonnes of cargo released into the sea include 15 tonnes of highly toxic products. This is not acceptable. We only found out too late and, as a result, medical inspection must be provided, paying special attention to the volunteers who dedicated themselves to restoring the environment. Finally, we think it absolutely essential to pay particular attention to preventing such risks, as well as to scientific research work in order to avoid and eliminate damage. A great many proposals have been made which warrant investigation. Solutions cannot be found at the last minute, when the disaster is already in progress. Consequently, the bulk of the action must be taken beforehand. Mr President, over two months after the wreck of the Erika, pollution of the coasts, which have already been cleaned once, is still continuing. While reiterating my solidarity with all the victims of this, I should like to salute the dedication of the workers, professionals and volunteers, who are still involved in cleaning the polluted beaches. Thanks to the grass-roots involvement, which this House furthered by organising a debate and adopting a resolution on 20 January, an initial raft of measures has been announced.	de
However, for the 80 per cent of services where there is a competitive market, prices have fallen. That shows that competition really is working. My conclusion is therefore: make sure that there is competition in the remaining 20 per cent of the market, too. It is against just such a background that more and more people are calling for ... (The speaker is interrupted by Mr Markov) I thought I had the floor. Perhaps we can discuss this later on. However, I should like to affirm that it is exactly as I said, namely, that prices have fallen in areas where there is competition, whereas they have risen where there is still a monopoly. That is usually the case. That is why I should now like to see a Commission that takes the necessary initiatives and sees to it that there is effective competition in the postal sector. Mr Markov, in five or six minutes time, you will be allowed a few minutes to speak. I would be grateful if you would not interrupt other Members. Mr President, there is a mystery. What happened to the Postal Services Directive that was passed on 15 December 1997? There has been a deafening silence from the Commission during the period between then and now. I am sorry it is Commissioner Monti who is here today. I am very fond of him. He is one of the more diligent and hard working commissioners. It is a pity I cannot say the same for some of his other colleagues. There has, over this period, been no real progress on the Postal Services Directive. Commissioner Monti stated that part of the reason for this was the organisation and reallocation of duties. That has only happened recently. For over a year the old Commission could have done some work on this. We really have not progressed very far. However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like him to take a message back to Commissioner Bolkestein telling him what the Postal Services Directive was about. It was about gradual liberalisation; it was about a guaranteed universal service at an affordable price; it was about direct mail and cross-border mail remaining in the reserved sector. These issues were fundamental in that report and they should be fundamental in any forthcoming directive. The postal service is not just for Christmas. It is for life. In the area in Scotland I come from it is much more than just a postal service. It is about keeping communities together. The postal service is also the bus service. The postal service is also the social service. The postal service is also the doctor. If we allow the postal services to drift into complete privatisation then we will lose all that and many of our local communities - we were voting earlier on tourism - will lose their tourist trade. We will cut them off. The postal services are important. That message must be taken back from here today. The Commission must listen to it. Mr President, we are in favour of liberalising the Union' s postal services. This should first of all stand for better service. This is the intention and it must be the ultimate goal.	es
The financial regulation is the legal framework we need to tackle the priorities established under the terms of the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus. I cannot start anything while there is no regulation in place, because I lack the legal basis for doing so. If the lamented lack of coherence should happen to have something to do with this point, then I am bound to say that this regulation is a legal framework and nothing more than that. This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management. On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy. . (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision. It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission. . (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council. I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate. I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work. In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still. Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer. I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us. Forgive me Mr Poos. There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me. This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high. Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday.	es
I must also stress that once again the Commission is, in fact, skirting the issue of practical action on equal opportunities. In conclusion, the document is not particularly satisfactory, and in some aspects is disappointing. Berend Report (A5-0107/1999) . (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union. We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues. Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards. This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level. We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area. This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes. Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State. The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State. . (FR) Considering the employment situation in the Community and the European Union' s declared ambition to steadfastly attack unemployment, the analysis of mergers carried out by the Commission should take elements other than competition into consideration. As an example I would give the restructuring of ABB Alsthom Power. A sizeable delegation of employees of this firm from throughout Europe is visiting Strasbourg today. The management of ABB Alsthom Power, following a merger carried out in June 1999, announced restructuring where there is already the prospect of layoffs in a number of countries. This damaging situation for employment raises many questions, particularly regarding the information given to the European Works Council, in existence since 1996. It suggests that the Community directive on European Works Councils must be updated and strengthened. It also requires the monitoring of mergers taking employment, the environment and consumers into consideration. Since the report of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs did not go far enough in this respect, I abstained. . (PT) By proposing to apply the principle of subsidiarity in Community competition policy, the Commission is devolving to national authorities and courts the responsibility to take decisions and deal with abuses of dominant positions in relation to company agreements which create market distortion. Issues of mergers and state aid however, still remain within the notification system.	fr
The European Union and its Member States should take the lead in providing a significant portion of these funds. In so doing, we would not only embarrass the United States into shouldering its responsibilities in relation to UN funding, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to defending human rights is more than simply empty rhetoric. Mr President, this debate is mainly concerned with the preparations for the forthcoming annual UN Human Rights Convention and the Commission' s and Council' s efforts in this respect. I would first of all like to say that I am very pleased with the contributions made by Mr Patten and the Minister, and I welcome the fact that both China and Cuba are on the agenda. Cuba is the last stronghold of dictatorship in South America and we must be mindful of this, with all due sympathy to Cuba. It is a dictatorship and hence not a democracy. I would, during my two minutes, like to draw attention to two countries which are close to my heart. The first country is Indonesia. We are naturally delighted that Indonesia is under new rule and that Mr Wahid and Mrs Sukarnoputri are the new President and Vice-President. We are also pleased that the situation in Timor is slowly moving in the right direction. But I can report that in the Moluccas, an area just north of Timor, the violence is still not under control. This has claimed thousands of lives over the past two years. Tens of thousands of people are on the run. The situation is badly managed. I know that tomorrow, or the day after tomorrow, an important programme will be shown on Dutch television, in which an appeal will be made for observers. This is with the sole purpose of monitoring what exactly is going on, so that at least a record can be made, not least for the future, for human rights committees, of what has been happening. My urgent request, which has been echoed many times in resolutions, is the following: could you not confer so that observers can be sent to the Moluccas? Surely thousands of people killed, thousands wounded and tens of thousands on the run is enough. My second country - I will be brief as Mr Patten knows this country very well - is Burma. Surely we cannot just keep silent about Burma. I have the feeling that that country is gradually being relegated to oblivion. For ten years now, the elected President of that country has been under house arrest. And for ten years now, its parliament has been out of action. Numerous MPs have been killed or have fled the country and only a few are left in Burma. There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India from Burma and yet it seems that that country is no longer given any attention. In my opinion, Burma should be put back on the agenda, too, certainly in the wake of Indonesia' s U-turn.	es
A new agreement has been reached with the ACP countries. This is a positive development in itself, especially given the pressures to terminate it and the fact that various Member States did not wish it to continue. We will have an opportunity in due course to consider the exact terms of this agreement in greater depth, but meanwhile there is no doubt that the European negotiators were more timid and failed to live up to the proposals that we formulated at the appropriate time, even if the new agreement does include some new and innovative points. Certain politically important aspects of the new partnership agreement will have contributed to these. This was without a doubt the result of a complex negotiating process in which both parties made major concessions, and this is certainly true of the European Union, especially in the field of good governance and trade. But it was above all the result of a stronger ACP group, which obviously found new courage following the events in Seattle. I particularly wish to stress that a new way of looking at these issues seems to be emerging, especially as regards trade, and it is certainly necessary to tackle this area. Lastly, we need to go further in our development aid policies towards developing countries. I have in mind budgetary and financing aspects, indebtedness, assistance in sensitive areas such as food safety, humanitarian, educational and health-related issues, and also fields such as the environment, investment and access to information and new technologies. This also applies to the sphere of trade, where we need to ensure real coherence between development policies and other Community policies, and also between both types of policy and corresponding policies originating in the Member States. We cannot simply forge ahead with something that in the past has shown itself to be inappropriate and wrong-headed. Mr President, having listened to the Council and the Commission today, I just had to look at my agenda. Yes, it does say: 'Coherence of different Union policies with development policy' . But we have not heard a single word on this subject, and I find that deeply embarrassing. We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years. It ought to have been here in writing today and, after having heard Mr Nielson' s speech, I can well imagine that he is up against a lot of powerful opposition in the Commission. I know that the Commissioner himself has some strong and extremely reasonable opinions on coherence, and these are what I should like to have heard expressed here today. Because the joint motion for a resolution proposes a range of effective mechanisms for ensuring coherence, I shall use the very short time allotted to me here just to mention one more such mechanism, namely obliging the Commission to carry out an evaluation of new, relevant legislation from this aspect. I also want to focus on the catastrophic effect the EU' s common agricultural policy has had on developing countries: dumping of beef in Sahel and South Africa, tomato purée in West Africa and milk powder in Jamaica.	es
How do we implement what the Treaties say in all those words about development assistance programmes? One or two honourable Members, Mr Ferber and Mr Cushnahan, spoke about the gap between rhetoric and reality. Mr Cashman said, which is right in a sense, that words are no substitute for real action. Of course, words can make a bit of a difference, a point that was made by Mrs Malmström. She said that she had received a letter from the Chinese Ambassador, a very amiable and highly intelligent representative and servant of his country, to tell her that she was wrong and the European Parliament was wrong in its attitude on human rights in China. I think after her speech she will receive a cascade of letters from the Chinese authorities. She will be able to fill a filing cabinet with letters about what is claimed to be the real situation in China. I think she was reflecting the views of many non-governmental organisations, many people who admire Chinese civilisation but are concerned about what is happening in China today.  Of course it is entirely right that we have to look at action, and the very first speech by Mr Salafranca mentioned two issues apart from Geneva which represent actions, one of which is of course made possible by the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of the European taxpayer - that is the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - about EUR 100 million that is spent through programmes, for which I am responsible, mainly going to non-governmental organisations to promote human rights and to promote democratisation. We will want to share with Parliament, as vicars say, our views on how that spending programme to support human rights can be best focused and best targeted in the years ahead. There is also the question which was referred to by Mr Salafranca, who I am sorry is unable to be with us at the end of this brief but useful debate. There is also the question of our overall policy on human rights and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy. I want to remind Parliament that the Commission will be publishing, before the middle of the year, a comprehensive, intellectual case for placing human rights at the heart of the development of the common foreign and security policy. It is immensely important, and if I had not thought that already, having listened to the remarkable speech by Mr Havel earlier in the day I would have certainly come to that conclusion. It has been a useful debate. I hope we can have further debates like this. I hope we can have, in particular, debates about some of the ways in which we translate these good intentions into practice on the ground where it matters, where people are still being tortured, where people are still being raped and are still being denied the sort of civil rights that this House takes for granted, as I do. I have received 7 motions for resolution, pursuant to Rule 37(2), to close the present statement. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Cyprus and Malta The next item is the joint debate on:	de
This question is very important and I would like to know - since this is a kind of 'baby fraud' - whether the Commissioner will see to it that these funds are not taken away from the Andalusians, so that the funds which the European Union are going to pay to Andalusia, based on the census, will take into account these 400 000 children which Aznar does not count when it comes to providing them with schools and services. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I would ask all of you - and do not take this as a warning - to deal with strictly Community matters. I know that these are very important issues in Spain and there are differing viewpoints. I would point out to the Commissioner that Mr Aznar is the President of the Spanish Government. You may answer the question. Mrs Izquierdo Rojo, I hear that you have a strong voice. I hope it is loud enough to be heard in Madrid for I realise that what you have said was not strictly intended for me. I have given you my answer. I am keen that the Structural Funds, particularly those in Objective 1, are allocated where needed. We have criteria which are applied and we know roughly what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive. I can only say that I must discuss these matters with the national authorities and government of each country. I am not avoiding the issue but I must abide by the general Regulation. It is the responsibility of these authorities and governments to allocate the funds as objectively and fairly as possible. I need to know about this allocation, however, and this is why I said that I could not answer today. As I did not have an answer, I wrote to the Minister for Economic and Financial Affairs on 14 December. I am about to lose patience at not having received an answer from him but I will send you this when I get it. I regret that the Commissioner has once again become involved in an imaginative and, in this case, passionate intervention. I would like to remind all of you that Spain is about to hold elections, and in fact there are just 25 days left before the elections. It should be of comfort to the Commissioner that these elections will take place in 25 days time, since after that he will probably not have to deal with this type of question again. I do believe it is important to say that Andalusia is going to receive 50% more within the Community support framework and that Spain also holds the record for the use of the Structural Funds, which means that the distribution is based strictly on the implementing regulations and is decentralised by means of the regional development plans and different Community support frameworks. Lastly I would like to ask the Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider it necessary to change the implementing regulations for the Structural Funds or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable? This is a fascinating debate which I realise is not totally Community-related. Having said this, we must accept that elections are always taking place in the countries of the European Union. I am pleased that the Structural Funds are the subject of discussions in Greece and Spain. We were talking a short while ago in this House about debates involving our citizens, about public debates.	it
After all, we find ourselves in a situation of historic importance, that is to say, we are negotiating or are on the point of taking up negotiations with 12 States, and together we have reached a stage at which closer European integration may be a reality in the not too distant future. How, though, is the Union to be enlarged if we do not do the job properly now, i.e. before enlargement takes place? That is why we as a group are in favour of the Intergovernmental Conference. We consider it to be indispensable and urgently needed and hope that it actually comes up with the goods that will enable us to carry out enlargement of the European Union in the not too distant future. My group, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, noted with satisfaction that the Council Presidency is far from happy with the current state of affairs. You can therefore rest assured that the Confederal Group of the European United Left/Nordic Green Left is committed to seeing that the Union gets on with the tasks in hand. What we are talking about is nothing more and nothing less than the future of Europe, and, in particular, a Europe that the citizens truly regard as being theirs, because they are instrumental in shaping it and because the cares and concerns, the problems and issues they face on a daily basis are also taken seriously by politicians. The politics of closed doors and private discussions; all that must be consigned to the past once and for all. That is why we need transparency. I believe it falls to you, as President-in-Office of the Council, to see to it that the train does not keep rolling on as before, leaving the people behind on the platforms as if they were ignorant as to the content of the treaties. We believe it is imperative not just to make every available effort to provide the citizens with comprehensive information on how the Intergovernmental Conference is going, and its outcome, rather they must be directly involved in the overall reform process to a far greater extent. We also take the view that the political decision-makers must at long last change the habit of a life-time and ask the citizens in referenda, once the Intergovernmental Conference is over, whether or not they go along with the way in which Europe is to continue to develop in the future. In this way, Europe would truly belong to the citizens and the Union would acquire an entirely new quality of democratic legitimacy. There is another central issue relating to democracy that I would like to make clear reference to. As a member of the convention that has now taken up its work on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I wish to make the following point clear: neither my group nor I are content with making a solemn announcement about the Charter. After all, what will the citizens say if we make a solemn announcement about rights to them but they are unable to take legal action in respect of these rights as individuals? No, to my mind this would only serve to deepen the credibility crisis facing the Union. The poor turnout at the European elections really should have been warning enough for everyone. What we need are visible rights for each and every citizen; the Charter of Fundamental Rights must be made legally binding for all the citizens of the Union. Together we should work towards this goal in the interests of the citizens, and what I expect to come out of the Intergovernmental Conference is that the relevant Cologne decision will be revised here at the end of the year. Of course, we are also talking about effectiveness of decisions and functioning institutions in a Union of 27 plus Member States.	de
What is the situation now as regards efforts to include psychological criteria in this crisis area and provide the best possible support here? Mr Rübig, as I said, I understand your concerns very well. I think that, at the moment, particularly in the last few months, there have been some positive developments in terms of the resources that will be available to Mr Kouchner, in order for him to be able to do his job efficiently. I heard Mr Kouchner speak at the Council of Europe ministerial meeting on this issue, and I think that many of the concerns he expressed then about the lack of resources needed to overcome some of the problems have now been addressed. In other words, he has been given these resources. There are two fundamental questions in particular. Firstly, an increase in police numbers would be an important factor in guaranteeing the safety of the civilian population and, in particular, in protecting certain sections of the civilian population. Secondly, an increase in appropriations would allow some officials who have important roles in the administrative and operational process in Kosovo to be kept on. The issue which we should all raise, and I did so myself, in a diplomatic way, a while ago, concerns the very substance of Security Council Resolution 12/99. I know that this is an extremely delicate issue, but we should all be questioning the logic behind this resolution and its chances of being implemented. We advocate that it should be implemented in its entirety. Nevertheless, we must look at this resolution, and this is also something that the United Nations Security Council will probably have to do sooner or later. We will have to do so because, as has happened in the past in other contexts and in other strategically important situations across the world, we must be in a position to assess a certain kind of process, and a certain kind of logic and balance - which were in fact the logic and the balance which led to this resolution being approved - should be maintained in future. What we have to do, and we in the European Union are already doing it, is to guarantee Mr Kouchner all the necessary resources, and you are right, Mr Rübig, we have a duty to our citizens to explain to them regularly and openly whether or not these resources are being properly used. We in the Council will be trying to provide information on this matter during the Portuguese Presidency. Mr Seixas da Costa, I totally agree with you. The problem is not Mr Kouchner but the legal basis on which he is working, namely Resolution 1244. Having said this, the EU' s responsibility, which is both yours and ours, is to try and move beyond the provisional nature of Resolution 1244 and devise a future scenario for the whole region. It is the failure to define this scenario which is causing or encouraging the excesses, accidents and assassinations mentioned by Mr Alavanos. Does the Council intend to raise the question of the definitive status of Kosovo? If so, does it intend to do so within a general redefinition of the region, avoiding as far as possible the multiplication of micro-States, as has tended to happen elsewhere, and reuniting the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania?	it
"For example, we have seen the success of the Leader I and Leader II schemes in Ireland in terms of the jobs which have been created through the administration of these programmes in rural parts of Ireland and within Europe. The Leader III scheme is set to be implemented some time later this year. The Leader programme at its core affords an opportunity for public, private and voluntary groups to pool their collective talents so as to create long-term and sustainable jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises in rural areas. This is a classic example of how the partnership concept operates and such schemes must be supported in its broadest remit. The European Peace and Reconciliation Fund has also been a success in creating jobs in border counties in Ireland. Once again, there is active participation from groups from the private, public and voluntary sectors which suggest how best particular funding can be spent so as to help different local job creation projects within this region. During the next round of EU Structural Funds 2000-2006, other EU initiatives such as ""Equal"" and ""Urban"" will be operating. These initiatives must also involve the participation of local authorities and local communities in an effort to identify where best European Structural Funds should be spent. The rapporteur refers to the need to implement an integrated approach to new EU Structural Fund plans and programmes. They must promote a decentralised, efficient and comprehensive partnership based on the skills and commitment of all sectors in regional and local authorities. This is very sensible because key economic and social difficulties in our country cannot be overcome unless there is key integration between national, European and local funding. . (FR) This report takes us back to the question of why we even have a regional policy. In order to reduce disparities between regions, of course. But more especially because, even though at first sight the European market guarantees us improved functioning of the economy, it may also be a source of inequality. Jacques Delors was accustomed to saying that the market was short-sighted and hence the political need to reduce disparities. It is precisely this phenomenon of solidarity which lies behind the European social model, which we are all in favour of, and which gave rise to the idea of economic and social cohesion. This is a real political objective, alongside economic and monetary affairs, drawn up in collaboration with Member States, regions and local communities, with the Commission itself responsible for issuing guidelines in order to show Member States what direction to take in order to achieve the objectives required in the context of programming. This is why I shall support this report, despite regretting the fact that, for timetabling reasons, the European Parliament was only consulted at a very late date on the guidelines intended to assist Member States, regions and local communities in the programming of Objectives 1, 2 and 3. Moreover, I would also urge this House to take into consideration the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, adding a whole raft of thoughts on key areas such as combating social exclusion, support for the social economy and the implementation of the employment strategy."	it
The European Union has a certain responsibility in view of that particular role, but we cannot undertake to rapidly rebuild structures that were, as you have said yourself, Mrs Karamanou, not the best before the military action in Kosovo. What is more, I do not believe, Mrs Karamanou, that the military action in Kosovo resulted in such a significant destruction of public health facilities as to have had a direct impact on the current situation. The present position is more dramatic in terms of displaced populations, and in terms of a whole raft of economic factors and of the level of satisfaction with basic health facilities resulting from the overall breakdown in organisational structures in Kosovo' s administration. This is the basic issue underlying the present situation as a whole. And if we cannot solve the political problem, which must be done in accordance with the relevant United Nations resolution, then we will not solve the problem of child health, nor the various other problems faced by this region. I would like to widen the debate and include the situation in Mitrovica. In cooperation with Europe, the international community rebuilt the hospital there too, but it is located in the northern part of the city, thus prohibiting access to Albanian Kosovars. This means that medical aid is still denied to the Albanian Kosovars. This is also happening elsewhere in the country, causing tension between the Albanian Kosovars and Serbs, making for a situation where nobody trusts anybody anymore and where Albanians do not want to be looked after by Serbs and vice versa. I understand very well what you are saying and you are right: the European Union should work in a wider context of international cooperation. But where will you place the emphasis? What will you do to ensure that Albanian Kosovars too can be cared for in a hospital, including that in Mitrovica? Mr Staes, the situation in Mitrovica is well known. This is a very special situation with a degree of inter-ethnic tension which fortunately is not matched with such severity in others parts of Kosovo. I perfectly understand Mr Staes' s concerns. Nevertheless, I would like to say that Bernard Kouchner' s work in this area has aimed to comply with the objectives of the relevant United Nations resolution, in an attempt to create multi-ethnic facilities which can serve the various communities, including the various aspects of the administration. I believe that we should not jump to conclusions here about who is responsible, because there are various protagonists involved. The situation in Mitrovica is appalling, and involves very special tensions, and I believe that the measures taken over the last few hours to create safe conditions in that area are to be welcomed. Nevertheless, I have to say that, regrettably, we do not have the police resources - and this is connected with the Member States' contributions - to guarantee the follow-up action we proposed to the military action, that is to say the establishment of inter-ethnic coordination mechanisms guaranteeing adequate safety for the various communities, and, in particular, access to hospitals.	de
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps. We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies. But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency. In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances. This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report. But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation. If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro. Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions. Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising. It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned. The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy. Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it. Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy. More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity. The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes. If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future. An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd. It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level. If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again. What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting. Promoting employment, however, is a long-winded affair and comes under structural policy. Member States, in particular, should adopt an effective policy. In order to achieve this, they must be given the necessary leeway. Rigidity by imposing social convergence criteria and other Community guidelines certainly does not create the necessary jobs.	de
And since this is St. Valentine' s day, as a former Mayor of a regional city, I propose that we should all declare our love for all the European regions which need that love. Mr President, Commissioner Fischler, rural development can and must tackle the problem from three different angles: preservation of jobs, stewardship of the countryside and, not least, local culture, because that is of the utmost importance. Only if the population can stay in the countryside will the quality of life in the countryside also be permanently assured. We can observe the consequences of migration from the countryside in several areas of the Alps and they are devastating. But I warn against using these programmes to take urban culture to the countryside. And neither should we create structures which are reliant on subsidies and which will be dependent on them forevermore. To really guarantee sustainability - a buzzword which has, since it gained new currency, become relatively devoid of meaning, but we all know what we mean by it - what is needed, amongst other things, is an integrated approach in the countryside towards, for example, tourism and agriculture. The investment needs to be visionary. Young, creative individuals must be made to feel an attachment to the countryside. If they all leave then nothing much will go on there any more. None of us think much of the principle of indiscriminate, all-round distribution, and the pilot projects need to act, as it were, like avalanches and trigger other similar projects. I would be in favour of supporting self-contained cycles of projects and, even though LEADER I and LEADER II may have had shortcomings here and there, overall they were certainly positive. I should like to ask that we consider granting derogations not only in the Nordic countries but also for mountainous areas - the Alps, the Pyrenees and the Sierra Nevada, from where I have just returned - in respect of population size and density. Mr President, I want to talk about the EQUAL report, especially the issue of the policy on refugees. Last week, we had a very impassioned discussion about the formation of the Austrian Government. Today, we are already discussing the Austrian coalition government' s policy on refugees because Mrs Stenzel, who is the author of the EQUAL report, of course represents Austria' s governing conservative party and its policy. The most startling aspect of her original report was that she wanted to limit aid to the small group of refugees covered by the Geneva Convention, that is to say so-called quota refugees or UN refugees. In actual fact, it is the other refugees, namely those outside the quota and those not covered by UN aid, who need aid the most. The Committee rejected this discriminatory proposal and decided that all refugees should have a place on the EQUAL programme on identical conditions. Some members of the Committee, however, supported Mrs Stenzel' s proposal and wordings. As I see it, this means that Mr Haider' s politics are already casting their shadow over this Parliament.	fr
This item has been postponed until the next part-session in March. It was erroneously included in today' s agenda. Mr Swoboda, I can confirm what you have just said and there is, in fact, a printing error. The document that has been distributed contains inaccuracies, because the decision has been taken to postpone the debate. Mr President, I just want to say that, as I was walking in this morning, I noticed two people smoking outside the Hemicycle. The smell is absolutely disgusting! Can you please do something about it? I cannot do anything about it myself, but you are quite right. We need a quick way of educating people, including those who do not obey the rules decided upon in this House. Regarding the problems caused by air travel delays, perhaps everybody who has had difficulty reaching Strasbourg for the present part-session should form a small group - although I am not sure that it will be small - to discuss the precise nature of the problems encountered. Coherence of EU policies with development The next item is the statement by the Council and the Commission on the coherence of EU policies with development.  Mr President, it is a great pleasure for me to address you for the first time on behalf of the Council presidency, particularly in view of the very important role that the European Parliament is bound to play in the near future, given the need to strengthen development policies at European Union level. The subject of the statement that I have the honour of presenting to you today, is the coherence of different Union policies with development policy. I shall, of course, give the Commission an opportunity to add to some of the observations that I shall be making. I would like to start by emphasising the need we all feel, at EU level, to reconcile the extraordinary development and progress that we have seen in many areas of life - not least because of the marked technological impetus over recent years, which has benefited people in all walks of life, throughout the world, in terms of well-being and improvements in living conditions - with the fact that, at the same time, there has been a substantial increase in the pronounced imbalances between some regions and geopolitical areas of the world. This endangers the stability of the international system and jeopardises peace. We are all therefore duty-bound to seek to match our policies better to this objective of achieving greater stability and greater balance in the various parts of our planet. The consequence of all this is a reassessment of development policies in response to the globalisation of economic and financial markets. A serious imbalance in the functioning of these markets has emerged, which has of course made it necessary to make important adjustments, which in turn inevitably mean new options as regards development policies. We will therefore find ourselves on the threshold of a new model for development policies which - and I would like to stress this - will require action on our part in four essential areas:	de
"But who defines these tasks? Who established the limit beyond which this public service mission is compromised? Our answer is clear: it is not the Commission nor even the Council or the European Parliament, but the people of each Member State by democratic procedures. To wish to proceed in any other way would be to distort the spirit of our institutions. Mr President, we are currently in the first phase of transposition of Directive 97/67/CE on postal services and I am terribly afraid that a new phase of liberalisation might be reflected in a significant reduction in the public service offered. During Mr Bolkestein' s hearing, my colleague Véronique Mathieu asked for an undertaking ""that any new proposals, once these are known, should be the subject of impact studies to determine the implications of this liberalisation programme before these provisions are adopted."" What has become of it? Do we have the results of this impact study? As you know, we members of the EDD Group, are in favour, along with others, of rural life, maintaining employment, and social cohesion in rural areas, a cohesion reinforced by high quality universal public service. Most assuredly I would like to be able to say that the examples I observe every day in my own country and in my own region, a very rural one, convince me that we can safely proceed to a new phase of liberalisation. Unfortunately, this is not the case and currently, by merging the start of the application of the European directive and the application of the 35-hour law, which is purely French, but also by changing the working time criteria, such as the 1 700 objects per hour to be handled per workstation as opposed to 1 400, as previously, in our rural areas we can observe either a reduction in public opening hours or a threat that some post offices will be closed. This is already an intolerable withdrawal of the public service. I have here the local paper for my municipality, which reads, ""The manager of the post office wishes to inform the local population that as of 3 January 2000"" - you can see how topical this is - ""the last collection will take place at 3.45 p.m. instead of at 4.30 p.m. as at present."" So you can appreciate why I am afraid of a phase of extensive liberalisation, and a package of measures which will entail a new wave of depopulation. As you know, in our country, each village has its own local post office or at least a post box, with a collection every day. The postman is not just a simple mail distribution operative but also the only social link with the local residents. So he delivers money too, and sometimes even medicines, thus making it possible for isolated elderly people to be supported in living at home. If postal services are liberalised in a poorly regulated way, more post offices will be closed, in the name of this infamous profitability, which is often the cause of rural regression."	es
I would like to say that, as we know, the Commission report on State aid to the steel industry does not include individual decisions made under the exception procedure, pursuant to Article 95 of the ECSC Treaty, but addresses decisions which are not covered by the code on aid for the steel sector. In respect of future provisions on aid for the steel sector, which will come into force in July 2002, we will ensure that strict discipline continues to be applied, and the industry itself now agrees on the need for this. When we have finalised our proposal on the new rules and decided on the most suitable legal form, I will be happy to present our viewpoint to you. So, Mr President, I will walk away from this debate, for which I am very grateful to Parliament, in the knowledge that we have the European Parliament' s intellectual and political support, which appears to come from all sides of the House, for competition policy, its basic appreciation for the work the Commission is carrying out and its confidence in our ability to continue to deliver in the future. I am especially grateful for all of this. We will continue the interinstitutional dialogue opened with the Committee for Economic and Monetary Affairs, and, at a more general level, with Parliament. In this regard, I liked your term, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi: we must all pull together, preferably in the same direction. Competition is not an end in itself, as Mr Rapkay rightly pointed out, but it plays an extremely important role in European integration. As Mr von Wogau said at the start of the debate, at the end of the day competition is not an abstract concept: it is in the public interest and forms the basis of the social market economy. I would also like to say that competition policy will play a valuable social, as well as economic, role in the European integration process, as it has done in the past. Thank you, Commissioner Monti. The joint debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. Protection under criminal law of the Union's financial interests The next item is the report (A5-0002/2000) by Mrs Theato, on behalf of the Committee on Budgetary Control, containing Parliament' s recommendations to the Commission on introducing protection under criminal law of the Union' s financial interests. Mr President, year after year we learn, mainly from the European Court of Auditors' test reports, that money is lost to the budget of the European Union on account of misdemeanours ranging from wastage, mismanagement, and irregularities to suspected blatant fraud. For some time now, these abuses have meant that Parliament has been called upon to initiate measures that should serve to protect the European taxpayer' s money, which, when all is said and done, is what sustains the Union' s budget. Particular attention in this respect should be given to combating fraud, to detecting it, punishing those guilty of it and preventing it from happening. Creating UCLAF by means of the Task Force and setting up the anti-fraud office OLAF were important steps, as was the regulation on protecting the financial interests of the Community and on local monitoring.	es
Chinese leaders are in no doubt about our position on all these issues and on developments in Tibet. We have made our views very clear to them. While we all know that for many people in China there has been a real long-term improvement in their economic prospects and their social and economic liberties, there is a dark side to the picture as well. Critics of tabling a resolution say that at least we now have a human rights dialogue with China. That is true and potentially valuable, although I have to say - and I have said to Chinese officials as has the presidency - that there has not been nearly as much content to our dialogue as we would have liked. Of course the dialogue has enabled us to identify and implement EU cooperation programmes in the human rights and legal spheres. That is very welcome and I also believe that our village governance programme should help to promote democracy at grassroots level. Naturally any dialogue as complex as the one on human rights is going to be a long-term process, but I wish I could point to more real gains. The next dialogue in Lisbon on 25 February will be an important test. It will show whether the dialogue is producing results or not. What, finally, do we want to see as the first steps? Well, for example, we would like to see China move from signing the UN Conventions on Civil and Political Rights and on Social and Cultural Rights toward actually ratifying them. I wish we were closer to that. Where does all that leave us this year? I repeat that Member States will have to make up their minds. What I hope is, first, that we in Europe will adopt a common position and stick to it, that we will not allow some to be picked off, that our position will not be based on self-delusion or pretence, that it will be a common position and a sensible position. I know that some people say we must have a better way of pressing our concern about human rights than through tabling resolutions. But if that is true, then at the very least we need to be more imaginative and honest with ourselves in looking for that way forward. If we are to rest our position on the human rights dialogue, then we need to be able to convince you, the NGO community and the public at large that it is actually getting somewhere. That, in my judgement, is the challenge for the next few weeks. I am grateful to the House for its concern about human rights around the world, and particularly in China. Thank you very much, Commissioner Patten. We will now interrupt the debate on the joint statement concerning the next session of the UN Human Rights Commission and proceed to the vote. Welcome I am delighted to welcome a delegation of the Hong Kong Legislative Council to Parliament. (Loud applause) VOTE . (DE) Mr President, following this vote, I would like to ask the competent Commissioner, Mr Byrne, if, now that he has seen how much support there is in this Chamber, he is prepared to adopt the proposed amendments?	it
"We would gain a great deal if we managed to export this model to the rest of the western Balkans with the help of the Macedonians. This model function also applies to regional cooperation. I could not agree more with the rapporteur: a balance must be struck between promoting regional cooperation on the one hand and maintaining the openness towards Bulgaria and Greece, and not cutting them off on the other. Mr President, Commissioner, if we manage this first step successfully, we will have gained a great deal. If we mess it up, then we will have lost a great deal more. Mr President, let me begin by saying that I have no problem with approving this very sound report in principle. I just want to point to one issue which in my view is not considered in the report and which raises a major problem in relation to Macedonia and the effectiveness of EU financial and other support. I am referring to the sanctions against Yugoslavia. Do not misunderstand me: I too believe that we need to take effective action against the Milosevic regime. But firstly, these sanctions have a far-reaching and adverse impact on many of the neighbouring states too, including Macedonia, which find themselves in an extremely difficult economic situation as it is. Secondly, the entire population of Yugoslavia is being held accountable for the actions of Milosevic and his circle, which is wrong on humanitarian grounds and politically counterproductive. So I believe that we should take today' s debate as an opportunity to call for a rapid end to the policy of sanctions, as stated in Amendment No 10. Mr President, we did not need to witness the end the Kosovo conflict to reach the conclusion that, after various wars in the territory of the former Yugoslavia, with their untold negative effects on the stability of the Balkans, a global and durable strategy for the whole region is needed, aimed at guaranteeing peace and stability in south-east Europe. This strategy, which took shape in the Stability Pact adopted on 10 June 1999 in Cologne, considers south-east Europe as a whole, but simultaneously recognises the diversity and unequal development of the various countries that compose the region. The European Union' s contribution under the Stability Pact, now converted into what is called the ""stabilisation and association process"" , represents a development in the regional concept the European Community drew up in 1996 for the five countries of the region: Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and Albania. Its most significant aspect was the establishment of political and economic conditions intended to support the implementation of the Dayton peace agreement, and it should therefore contribute to regional stability. So establishing relations between the European Union and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia on a completely new basis, and offering that country the prospect of full integration into the structures of the European Union through the mechanism of the stabilisation and association process, constitutes an important contribution to stability in the Balkans."	fr
"We must give them all our support to reach that goal. Human rights is such an important issue within the ACP-EU Assembly that Joint Vice-Presidents have been appointed with special responsibilities for monitoring human rights closely and reporting to the Assembly. A number of cases have been highlighted, including the child soldier issue in Sudan, where many children have been abducted from neighbouring states. I had the honour of being elected the European Co-President at the beginning of this fifth term and Mr Clair from Mauritius is the new ACP Co-President. I would like to see a number of changes to our Assembly, particularly after the signing of the new Convention in May. We must have more equality between our ACP partners and our European members and I want to get rid of the ""them and us"" syndrome. Firstly, I would like to see a Joint Parliamentary Assembly of elected members from ACP countries and not ambassadors or government ministers sitting there as delegates. This I think is the new Convention. Secondly, the new Convention allows for regional assemblies in the six regions, which would allow us to be much more specific in our work. These assemblies would report back to the Joint Assembly. We had a regional debate in Nassau in the Caribbean and this was extremely productive. We are going to have one in Abuja in West Africa too. I want the Assembly to stop being just a talk-shop and become a work-shop for the betterment of all the people in developing countries. I want to see civil society given a louder voice. But to do that we have to see an end to corruption and we have to face this head-on. We must reward those nations which are making the effort to live by the rules of good governance. Equally, we should come down hard on those who are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the pluralist governments that we demand. I am delighted to see the result in Zimbabwe. European taxpayers will no longer accept their taxes being fraudulently used. A new wind of change must blow through Africa and new standards must be set and lived up to. The Joint Assembly should play a leading role in monitoring the enactment of good governance, human rights and democracy in cooperation with the Commission. I believe that as equal partners the EU- and ACP-elected delegates are up to that task. I beg to move acceptance of this report. Mr President, let me begin by congratulating Mr Corrie on his excellent and comprehensive report. Our approach to development policy must always be based on respect for human rights and the fight against poverty. But there is a crass contradiction between fighting poverty and the cuts in development aid appropriations in many Member States and in the EU. With regard to financing, we must look to the future and provide the Joint Assembly with additional funds so that, for instance, we can send delegations to the ACP states to oversee electoral processes, at their invitation. In future, the EU must take a far more multilateral approach when it agrees development projects and, furthermore, must coordinate more closely with the individual states in order to improve efficiency and use the funding more effectively."	de
"In a debate within the Socialist Party on the Irish process, someone said: ""In the end, the key to the Irish solution was that everyone involved had the following thought: does it really matter whether we are Irish or British? Everyone can be what they want to be because, if Ireland and Britain are both in the European Union, there is no point in killing each other for being Irish or British. What difference does it make if the national level is no longer going to function?"" We in the Basque Country could ask ourselves the same question. Does it really matter if we are Basque or Spanish or European? We have talked a lot about what it is to be Basque, but a Basque today dresses like a Dane and reads the same things as a British person. If life is going to be lived on a much more global basis, as is already happening, and our children will therefore be living in the Europe which we are creating, why are we killing each other for being Basque or Spanish?' Fernando Buesa also said the following, which everyone in Ireland has probably thought. 'If we are killing each other for no reason - and this was happening in Ireland because there were paramilitary groups on all sides - we should be resolutely asking ourselves this question in the Basque Country too. What difference does it make to be Basque? Surely it is all the same thing. You can be what you want to be. If, in the future, economics and politics and vital decisions for each country are dealt with in the European arena, there is no point killing or dying for being Basque or Spanish' . May he rest in peace. (Loud applause) Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European People' s Party and European Democrats, I want to express our most profound feeling of solidarity with the families of Fernando Buesa, an elected representative of the Basque people, and Jorge Díez, a member of the Basque police force. We also naturally want to express our solidarity with the whole of the Basque Socialist Party. In recent times, in this House, we have sadly had to discuss the various faces of extremism in Europe. It does not matter what banner these come under because, in the end, they are all different expressions of the same thing. Faced with these, we democrats cannot resign ourselves to the peace of the dead. On the contrary, we must take strength from knowing that the only social division which exists in the Basque Country is the abyss which separates those who kill, and those who support and express understanding for the latter, from the vast majority of the Basque people who simply want to live in peace and freedom. (Loud applause) Madam President, on behalf of the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party, I must indicate my complete and categorical condemnation of the terrorist attack on 22 February in Vitoria which took the lives of the socialist MP and spokesman in the Basque parliament, Fernando Buesa, and his bodyguard, Jorge Díez. In a country governed by the rule of law and which is a member of the European Union, it should be possible for all ideas and options to be defended, provided that this occurs democratically and with respect for the rights of the individual and the principles and values of justice, freedom and economic and social progress on which the Union is based. The transgression of these principles is simply not acceptable, as clearly indicated in the Treaties."	it
"Berend Report (A5-0107/1999) . (PT) We basically agree with the assessment and the thoughts put forward by the rapporteur concerning the sixth periodic report on the social and economic situation and development of the regions of the European Union. We shall therefore confine ourselves to highlighting a few issues. Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards. This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level. We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area. This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes. Finally, but no less importantly, I would like to refer to the rapporteur' s proposal that, in future, this type of report should also include, amongst other issues, an analysis of the way cohesion is developing between the regions within each State. The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue. This kind of assessment would enable us to allow and guarantee corrections to regional (and other) policies with a view also to guaranteeing internal cohesion within each Member State. . (FR) The Berend report gives us an interesting analysis of the situation and economic development of the regions of the European Union. Nonetheless, the French members of the Union for a Europe of Nations Group feels it cannot approve some of the statements made therein. Paragraph 26, for example, ""Draws attention to the special need to consolidate the budget as a prerequisite for the success of economic and monetary union and the enlargement of the Union"" . At a time when, in order to fulfil the convergence criteria, Member States are forced to undergo a strict budgetary slimming regime, one that would be perfectly justified if they undertook it of their own initiative, the federalists are displaying an astonishing pecuniary gluttony. As an admission of the failure of the cohesion policy and EMU, the lack of results is put down to the lack of money, with everyone competing in eloquence to demand more and more appropriations without anyone asking questions about the effectiveness of the money spent. What can one say about a budgetary procedure which involves setting objectives for expenditure rather than a ceiling on expenditure and trying at all costs to find projects in order to spend the approved appropriations, rather than allocating the appropriations to existing projects?"	es
We must argue for equality of the sexes, the famous 'gender mainstreaming' , which is one of the least developed questions in the Prodi Commission' s programme. This means prioritising sex equality, the adaptation of the social model and, above all, an unequivocal fight against populism whenever our economic and social cohesion is under threat. This must also be a main priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented with a forthright fight against racism and intolerance so that we may come to recognise, in practice, the evolution of a Union which has become a magnet for the rest of the world and an immigration zone, given its prosperity and seasonal demographics. I believe that this is the first objective for us to pursue. In this respect I would also add another element, which is economic government, given the single currency, and I believe this is inescapable. This is another question on which the Commission must make progress. With regard to the ambitious objectives and, above all, the Commission' s important step of adopting this broadening of the process of negotiation and integration, I would like - and my Group would like - more clarification in relation to the revision of Agenda 2000. Does the Commission think that there will be never be any revision? The issue of taxation also seems to us to be absolutely essential. With regard to governance in general, I believe it might be worth thinking in theoretical terms. I would like to remind you of one thing: it is dangerous to rethink the entire governance of the European Union from here. I would be clearly in favour of subsidiarity. If we are capable of defining what our area of governance is, I think that would be very positive. In all other areas, I believe that subsidiarity is also relevant to this discussion. Not only should the Commission discuss this, but also our states, our parliaments and our civil society. Madam President, I would like to refer briefly to the last objective, which seems to us to be absolutely fundamental: the stabilisation of the continent and the strengthening of the Europe' s role in the world. It appears that there is agreement and support with regard to the prioritisation of South-East Europe, with regard to enlargement and - as I have said already - with regard to the process of integration and the strengthening of the Euro-Mediterranean programme and our ability to prevent conflicts, as well as an issue which we seldom talk about; the North-South challenge. We must not forget Africa, a continent which has been forsaken, not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our important contribution to cooperating with development. Lastly, an issue for which we are increasingly responsible, as the world' s foremost economic and commercial power, that is, Europe' s voice in the world, which does not simply mean adopting an active approach to the Millennium Round. It means the reform of the United Nations and the international financial institutions, for which Europe has an enormous responsibility.	es
I believe that the Commission' s proposal should make provision for greater transparency in terms of the way the various institutions function, but I think that there is always room for improvement in this matter. For our part, we are prepared to study any proposals made in this area. It is a very important question indeed which Jonas Sjöstedt and others have asked. We have a principle of transparency in Sweden which strengthens democracy and ensures that there is a worthwhile dialogue between citizens, decision makers and authorities. We are very anxious indeed that the EU, too, should move in this direction, and this is also stated in the Treaty of Amsterdam. One or two years ago, Parliament adopted a report by Mrs Lööw which is extremely important in this context. The report warned that the forthcoming process would lead to restrictions upon the transparency of the Member States. We can now see that there is perhaps some reason for this warning from Parliament. I want to ask the Council if it understands this warning, in view of what we have now seen in the working documents from the Commission. I listened very carefully to what Mr Seixas da Costa had to say on transparency and the Intergovernmental Conference. My concern is, if I have understood Mr Seixas da Costa correctly on the interesting points he made as regards transparency and the IGC, whether the Portuguese Presidency will take on the commitment to tackle the issue of widening the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference. After all, examining the issue of transparency in the ways the institutions operate should never be hidden away under any old heading or confined to some lobby or other - though I know full well the importance of these lobbies. It should have its own heading in the agenda of the Intergovernmental Conference, which would mean widening the agenda. Mr Dimitrakopoulos, transparency is naturally an issue of concern to the institutions. This Intergovernmental Conference will, at the outset, concentrate on improving the way the institutions operate, particularly taking account of the desire we all share for them specifically to become more democratic, more transparent and more efficient. All of this must nevertheless be done whilst respecting a broad framework - that of the overall acceptability of any solutions we may devise to achieve these three aims. It is obvious that transparency will be a permanent fixture on the European agenda and it will, of course, feature on the agenda of this Intergovernmental Conference. I can assure you that this is an issue which the Portuguese Presidency will keep before the Member States and the representatives of the preparatory group for the conference. It must therefore be able to count on the support of the Members of the European Parliament, who will surely rally behind this proposal. We will then see, at ministerial level, how we can follow this up. It should nevertheless be noted that we have just concluded the Treaty of Amsterdam, which was approved last May, and that there is a raft of implementing measures on transparency which are still in progress. The question is whether it is premature or not to start a new initiative on the subject of transparency. My feeling is that, in spite of everything, this issue will always have to be on the agenda, because the public is clearly concerned about it, and because it is linked with the need to make the European institutions accountable to the public.	de
Postal services do not provide simply a postal delivery service but also a social service. Occasionally for some people the postman is the only person they see all day. We can salute them, these postmen who, whatever the weather, sometimes walk for miles to be able to offer this service to everyone. Dismantling the postal service, the local communication service, would be a serious mistake and we would be unable to maintain the principle of the equality of all citizens. Profitability at all costs means going against fraternity and against social cohesion. Mr President, I voted for the resolution and should like to explain my motives. Several speakers mentioned that the only person with whom many elderly people have any contact is the postman, particularly in mountain communities. I wholeheartedly agree. However, it also seems to me that the pensions of many elderly people are being reduced as a result of national budget constraints. In my own country, Italy, there are some 200 000 postal workers who cost the state approximately ITL 50 million a year per capita, or EUR 25 000, that is, a total cost of around EUR 5 million. Liberalisation of postal services would mean that the state could give each pensioner an extra ITL 10 million a year so that a million pensioners would see their pensions doubled. That should amply compensate them for forgoing their contact with the postman. Mr President, I voted in favour of the resolution on European postal services with all the more satisfaction since it reiterates once again the position I have always defended in this House, which is the need for a high quality universal service, particularly ensuring this service in the least populated regions and rural regions, and there are some even in my small country, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. In these regions but also in some districts of towns and cities, as Mr Posselt explained so clearly, post offices and postmen have an almost socio-cultural role, I might say, which goes beyond merely delivering mail. I know that this service is unprofitable. It would perhaps be less costly to make a fax or email available to isolated houses or villages. In principle, I am in favour of abolishing public sector monopolies, whether in water, gas, electricity, telephone, satellite, cable or any other services. Nonetheless, liberalisation, which has a lot to offer to the consumer in terms of the price and the quality of the service, especially in the telephone sector, must cease as soon as the service provided becomes inadequate or disappears, when the firms profiting from liberalisation are not making money. If they cannot be obliged to provide what the state monopoly was able to guarantee, particularly thanks to its obligation to provide a universal service, then the public service must be protected. I feel we can still afford to maintain a postal service, even if our post offices operate like businesses. They clearly have to make some effort so that they are no longer described as snail mail even if they cannot attain the speed of email.	it
We are charged with particular responsibility for the promotion of regional economic development. The beginning of the talks with Syria paved the way for a convening of the multilateral steering group in Moscow at the end of the month. I look forward to attending that meeting and hope that at last we can begin to push things forward again. The European Union has an important role to play in the peace process, as all sides - Palestinians, Israelis, their Arab neighbours and the United States - have acknowledged. Nor is our role confined to that of banker. We must be prepared to act swiftly to support the consolidation of peace in the region. But we should not kid ourselves: a comprehensive Middle East peace deal comes with a hefty price tag. The Commission is already considering the implications for the European Union of the recent encouraging developments. We intend to share our more detailed thoughts on the matter with Parliament and Council soon. But let me remind honourable Members that the European Union is no slouch when it comes to financial support for the peace process. We are the largest of all donors to the Palestinians. We have also offered very substantial support to Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt. With the Israelis we have established closer cooperation in a number of areas of particular interest to them. The Community contribution of over EUR 600 million in grants and loans between 1994 and 1998 effectively underpinned the Palestinian authority and contributed substantially towards the reconstruction of the deteriorated physical infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza. European Union Member States together contributed another EUR 860 million during that crucial period. In this context, let me applaud the important steps that the Palestinian authority has recently taken to improve budgetary transparency. President Arafat will be meeting the Council of Ministers next week. This will be a good opportunity to address the need to take similarly courageous steps to improve the Palestinian administration and to bolster the rule of law. The Commission is actively involved in those efforts. The Commission has also stepped up its planned support for regional cooperation projects between Israelis and Arabs. We committed more than EUR 20 million for such projects last year. This package included renewed assistance for people-to-people activities and cross-border cooperation where Israelis and Arabs meet on non-governmental and expert levels. Members will recall that the European Union is the largest financial donor to the overall efforts in bringing reconciliation to the people of the Middle East. A number of issues naturally emerge as additional potential targets of Community support in the coming phase of the peace process - among them, helping to consolidate a Golan settlement both in terms of contributing to security arrangements and supporting demining and the rebuilding of communities in the Golan Heights. Syrian economic development will need assistance for the transition from a wartime to a peace economy. Reconstruction and rehabilitation of southern Lebanon, the only Middle Eastern area with an ongoing military conflict, will also demand considerable efforts.	de
"Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too. It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve. If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics. Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power. To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply. Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today. I would like to quote verbatim from the report: ""State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."" I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation. I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe. Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper. I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000. I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace. No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe. The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with. But opinion differs as to the solution. The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation. In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse. Both I and other MEPs utterly reject such a drastic change of system. I do not accept that a practical transposition problem should give rise to changing the law. We would be changing the law to make it executable again, which is something I consider to be unacceptable."	fr
I shall give you the floor for any points of order after the vote. Report (A5-0029/2000) by Mr Brok, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, on the proposal for a Council regulation on the implementation of operations in the framework of the pre-accession strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM(1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199(CNS)) Relating to Amendments Nos 22 and 24 Madam President, I want to condemn the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. On Third Pillar matters such as these conventions which are so important for the construction of an area of freedom, security and justice, it is unacceptable for the Presidency-in-Office of the Council to be absent. I also want to mention the translation problems, of which I will give just one example, as we do not have much time. Correct translation is vital in this subject as it involves very precise legal concepts. Amendment No 83 in Italian, which is the original version, states that 'il minore deve essere assistito da una persona di sua fiducia o da un perito o legale esterno' . The term 'legale esterno' has been translated into French as 'avocat neutre' . I have no idea what an 'avocat neutre' is. It rather seems like a contradiction in terms. However, in the Spanish version the 'abogado' has disappeared completely. Madam President, you have said several times that this is a very serious problem. The lawyer-linguists should work very carefully to ensure that a reasonable version is produced. Quite, Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi, this is not the first time and it is indeed most worrying. We shall address this problem and check all the translations. Madam President, I simply wanted to add my voice to that of Mrs Palacio Vallelersundi before the vote started, to say that I regret very much the absence of the Council from this debate on such important votes on matters of the Third Pillar. I should like you, Madam President, to express to the Council our wish that they be present at such votes in future. Quite, I am well aware that their absence is highly irregular and I shall be most happy to pass this on. Relating to Amendment No 31 Madam President, in the phrase which reads 'Where consent to the transfer is required from the person concerned' , the words 'under the national law of the requesting or requested Member State' should be added after 'Where' . (Parliament adopted the legislative resolution)  Madam President, in the heat of the moment I forgot to mention that, in my report on the excessive deficit procedure, the last paragraph of the explanatory statement contains a mistake in the Spanish version. An 's' has been omitted and instead of reading 'la propuesta nos parece correcta' , it reads 'la propuesta no parece correcta' which is completely the contrary. I just wanted to correct this. Proposal for a resolution (B5-0132/2000) by Mrs Bonino and others, on behalf of the TDI Group, on the Commission communication on the strategic objectives for the next five years	de
(The sitting was closed at 11.50 p.m.) Resumption of the sitting The Minutes of yesterday' s sitting have been distributed. Are there any comments? (The Minutes were approved)  Mr President, I should like make a comment in connection with a meeting held last night by various Members of Parliament from all groups. The purpose of the meeting, which was attended by several Vice-Presidents and Quaestors, together with the architects who designed this building, was to discuss how we could improve our working conditions. We discovered during the meeting that the lovely white curtain behind you, Mr President, in fact conceals a huge window which, if the curtain were drawn back, would afford a wonderful view over the river. We were told that the curtain was closed so that you would not have your back to the light and to improve the lighting during debates. But what is to prevent us, before the sitting is opened or when you close the sitting, opening the curtains and enjoying the apparently magnificent view behind you? I am more than happy for our House to be illuminated by the brilliance of our debates but a little real sunlight on our bubble of democracy from time to time would not come amiss. I think it would be a nice idea if you could discuss opening this curtain from time to time with the ushers. Thank you very much Mr Onesta, I am grateful for any suggestions that will make our Chamber more conducive to human comfort. I would propose that we carry on in the normal way for the time being. In the meantime, I will have someone check as to whether it would be a simple matter, technically speaking. If so, then we will have a trial run for half an hour and see how it looks when the President sits with his back to the light! UCITS . (SV) Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, it is my hope that Parliament is prepared now to make a decision to extend and strengthen the financial market in Europe. As a new Member of the European Parliament, it has been very interesting and instructive for me to be given responsibility for this important matter. I should especially like to thank my colleagues on the committee for their willingness to find compromises; the President and the Bureau for lending a sensitive ear to this complex issue; the Commission, and especially the Commissioner, for being such worthwhile contacts; the Council; and also the division responsible for servicing the committee, for its selfless work. There was a good deal of agreement within the committee, apart from on a matter which, too, I hope it will be possible to solve. The issue of UCITS may appear difficult, technical and a political minefield. I believe that some people do not even know what UCITS stands for. Allow me, however, to state very clearly that this is a question which really does affect the citizens of Europe in so far as it relates to how their savings are administered, what options there are available, how competition operates between countries in regard to different forms of savings, savers' demand for security, and the opportunities Europe' s citizens have to save wisely for their old age.	de
Having said that, governing means planning. It also means being responsible and, in this new context which has been forced upon us, competition law naturally has an essential role to play. In this area, the Commission has given priority to a number of routes of action: acting on the structure of markets by actively combating anti-competitive practices, by refocusing its departments' supervisory activities only upon matters with a manifest Community interest and by affirming its intention to modernise competition law. As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints. Finally, on the subject of modernising the implementation of Articles 85 and 86 of the Treaty, we do not think that decentralised application would necessarily be going in the right direction. The Commission is, in fact, retaining not only the power to take matters out of the jurisdiction of national authorities, but clearly obliging the national jurisdictions to avoid disputing the decisions of the Commission at all. National states would thus become the secular arm of the Commission regarding observance of the application of rules which they do not control. In conclusion, I would say that while some measures are heading in the right direction, we shall of course remain vigilant in order to prevent the snowballing of Federalism which, if it were realised, would be to the detriment of Europe and the sovereignty of the states. Mr President, Commissioner, we have a basically positive view of the Commission' s White Paper on competition, particularly as regards the abolition of the system of notification and authorisation, but we are also puzzled by several things. First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes. In this respect, we should heed the words of von Eieck, and doubtless also those of the great Italian liberal Bruno Leoni, who warned precisely against the risks of an abnormal increase in anti-competition policies. State interference in the economy is, even today, still to blame for the most serious hindrances placed in the way of the market, competition and freedom of choice for European users and consumers. There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann.	fr
Cross-border workers, employees on secondment and migrating employees, as well as job-seekers, students on placement and other students, experience hindrances in exercising the right of free movement. This is due to a lack of coordination and a lack of convergence in terms of social protection. In fact, the same phenomenon occurs in tax law. In order to combat distortion of competition and prevent dumping, the Commission has, in my opinion, developed a well-balanced approach which steers a midcourse between harmonisation and non-intervention. On the one hand, binding and enforceable rules apply to equal pay or additional old-age pensions and on the other hand, programmes are used to offer incentives with regard to non-discrimination or social exclusion. Based on a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has made another step in the convergence process by setting out objectives and by setting up a working party of high-ranking officials.  Both proposals have already been accepted by the Council and it is thus a matter of endorsing this approach in order to be able to make an assessment in time, with knowledge of all facts and/or in order to establish to what extent and in what way social protection should be reorganised in the European Union. Indeed, expansion, globalisation, a sharp increase in the ageing population, individualisation and changes in family situations render such reorganisation inevitable. Denying that such shifts take place is tantamount to surrendering social protection. With regard to eurosceptics and nationalists, I would say that social protection within the boundaries of a Member State is not social and offers no protection. Indeed, if social protection were to be phased out as a result of competition, this would also harm social protection as a production factor. And less social protection means less purchasing power, fewer healthy employees and fewer happy employees. In respect of the super-Europeans, I would say that European social protection is neither attainable nor desirable. The discrepancies between the Member States are too immense in terms of provisions, rightful claimants, revenue or benefits, etc. It is thus impossible to bring all States into line. The path which the Commission is walking is, in fact, obvious. It has the advantage of clarity, and it can collect data and exchange experiences in order to agree on objectives and finely tune solid, comparative indicators and put forward recommendations. I endorse this view. I will give my support to the Commission and I hope that Lisbon will take us a step forward in this matter. Mr President, Mr Andersson' s report contains a lot that is of interest. Unfortunately, what is most interesting is that the report, which purports to be concerned with a combined strategy for modernising social policy, instead proposes an extension of traditional social policy and more supranationalism in the social sphere. Social policy needs to be renewed in order to reduce unemployment in the Member States. Even though the socialists, now that there are so many social democratic governments, talk much less about unemployment than they used to, the unemployment in question is still high, and this in spite of the trade boom.	it
The second aspect that we need to consider, in relation to the coherence of policies, is development policy in the context of the Union' s foreign policy. We know that the Union has entered a new era as regards its foreign policy, and we know that, with the creation of the High Representative, of the Rapid Reaction Force and of the military crisis management capacity, there is a whole trend towards confirming the status of the European Union that we should not underestimate when we consider the role of development policies. We also know that there are issues associated with political dialogue, with the adoption of common positions or joint actions, with the preparation of joint strategies, with preventive diplomacy, and with the development of regional capacity for crisis prevention and management. There can be no doubt that implementing and developing all these aspects will inevitably make an important contribution to strengthening the role of development policies in the context of the European Union' s foreign policy. It has to be said that, in approaching development policy in the context of foreign policy, the European Union is bound to go down the same road as many Member States have done with their own development policies in the context of their individual foreign policies. The success of this is bound to involve a need to strengthen decision-making mechanisms and institutional structures relating to the common foreign and security policy, so as to secure better coordination between instruments of development policy and instruments of foreign policy. In this context, we are convinced that we need to move away from the post­colonial model towards to a truly European model of development aid. I say this because we know that, in Europe, development policy has been very much shaped by the policies of certain Member States, in view of the post-colonial concerns of those states. The third aspect that needs to be considered is European Union policy and Member States' policy. Coherence of policies at European level certainly means better coordination of Member States' policies with the European Union' s development policy. If we do not establish improved mechanisms to ensure coherence between national policies, it will certainly be more difficult to deliberate against a background of greater coherence in European Union development policy. Ladies and gentlemen, the fourth and final aspect that I would like to draw to your attention, regarding development policy, is, of course, the Development Council. There have been discussions, especially in recent months, about the role the Development Council could play in relation to EU policies. As you know, there is a glaring difference between the status of development policies and other EU policies - you only have to look at the difficult circumstances surrounding the EDF' s financing, or rather lack of financing. It is difficult to imagine achieving greater coherence in the European Union' s policies without the Development Council playing a more active and interventionist role in relation to political decisions, which clearly come under the development banner and which are being dealt with in other Councils, in other decision-making forums, ranging from the Agriculture and Fisheries Councils to the Environment Council. Up to now, the Development Council has not had any opportunity to make its voice heard or to intervene in relation to these decisions.	fr
The UN has a peace plan. We ought to seize this opportunity and bring the last colonial episode in Africa to an end. I also want to take up the subject of migration. I am anxious about the new stipulations in the partnership agreement with the ACP countries, which might make it easier to expel immigrants, asylum seekers and refugees on flimsier grounds. I really also want to see the EU pioneer patents on living organisms. We now know that at least one person in the world dies of hunger every four seconds. Three quarters of those who die are children under five years of age. This is not because of a lack of food, but because of what we have talked a lot about today, namely increasing poverty. Food safety and the guarantee of biological diversity must take precedence over commercial interests. I believe that patents on living organisms are designed only to control the global food supply, specifically for commercial purposes and for no other reason. I also want to see something about women in the report I hope the Commission will produce. Women appear to be completely absent from all areas, especially development policy when, of course, we are not in reality absent at all. Mr President, the debate we are holding today strongly underlines the need to discuss development policy in much broader terms than are involved in simply measuring the flow of aid. The level of aid is naturally important, and the level of aid contributed by the rich countries as a whole ought to be increased. This ought to be done with, in particular, a view to combating poverty and through investing in the development of capacity. However, the level of aid is only one of many instruments which significantly influence the development of poor countries. A number of colleagues have today pointed to areas in addition to aid which are important and where contrasts and conflicts between different policy areas are very serious indeed. The latter include trade, agricultural and fisheries policies. Other important areas are, of course, the flow of private investments, cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the welfare state deals with, and finances solutions to, a variety of global problems which affect us all. These problems include questions of climate, health issues, biodiversity etc, and the problems are clearly exacerbated by globalisation, that is to say the new economy which is developing. In this economy, the connection between different policy areas is that much more marked. In my opinion, what we are discussing here today is partly the EU' s contribution to the debate about the opportunities and risks of globalisation and about the rules there must be in order to give poor countries a decent chance. The report, or survey, which Mrs Maij-Weggen has demanded, showing how the various policy areas fit together and what the aforementioned conflicts appear to be, is naturally quite crucial. I cannot help but wonder why the Commission has not done more.	fr
"- (PT) Mr President-in-Office, I would like to congratulate you on having persuaded Europe that the modernisation of the economy and social cohesion are concepts that can be mutually compatible. The preparations for the Lisbon Summit have demonstrated that people in Europe are not working hard enough and that if we want to be the most dynamic region in the world, we not only have to work harder, but we will have to do this with more information at our disposal, combined with an ability to use that information. If we are to increase the rate of employment and fund our social security systems, we will have to have a longer working life and, above all, we will have to have more and better trained women in work. We therefore hope that this Lisbon Summit will help to change the present model of female employment. I would like to ask you, Mr President, if you envisage this summit yielding conclusions which will enable specific, timetabled measures to be adopted so that there are not only more women in the world of work, but above all, in the new knowledge economy? Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful for the excellent and highly pertinent contributions you have made during this debate on the preparation for our Lisbon Special Summit. I think that we needed to have this debate and we also needed to involve Parliament, because in my opinion Europe still lacks strategic direction. In order to achieve this strategic direction, there must be an institutional alliance which transcends the natural differences of political opinion. This alliance has in fact been given form in the excellent contribution that Romano Prodi' s Commission has just made to the preparations for the Lisbon Summit with their paper. The fact that Parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important. At the Lisbon Summit, in addition to agreeing on a strategy, I would like us to define a set of measures and an open form of coordination. Let me give two examples which relate to everything that has been said here about the practical measures I would like to see adopted. One is that by 2002, all of Europe' s schools and training centres should be connected to the Internet and that they should at the same time have appropriately trained staff to provide the training which young people leaving secondary education need. I also would also like to see everyone receiving professional training, whether they are unemployed or not, to be able to gain a kind of ""driving licence"" for the information society, which will enable them to operate computers and navigate the Internet. If this happens, we will then be providing a framework under which information technology is not a cause of social division, that is to say of a widening in the gulf between those who succeed and those who fail. On the contrary, it will be a major vehicle for integration and for combating social exclusion. My second example is this: a great deal has been said about the participation of women in the labour market and about equal opportunities for women and men in society in general. Practical measures relating to what I spoke about earlier - a common goal for support services for families and particularly for children - are a key factor in creating jobs and at the same time creating equal opportunities and ensuring much greater participation by women in the labour market."	it
We can never in a million years solve Europe' s environmental problems alone. Finally, a word in the ear of those who, for financial reasons, are still hesitant: think what the alternative cost of cleaning up our seas would be. There will come a time when we shall be able to meet imperatives of this kind. We shall then be grateful if we have done everything in our power to prevent oil spills.  Mr President, I would like to state briefly that I do not believe that anyone doubts the need for a directive to tackle this problem, which is a serious problem not only for Europe, but for all seas world-wide, and that urgent and effective measures are therefore necessary. I would like to make it clear that there is a series of principles which are universal, and with which we are therefore in complete agreement. First, every port must be equipped with the necessary facilities for the treatment of waste. Secondly, polluters must pay, naturally. I agree that there may be discrepancies in exceptions regarding the type of ship or devices for measuring the length of ships. However, what cannot happen is a battle leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports, where we find ourselves with a series of theoretically environmental measures on the protection of the coast or the sea, leading to a distortion in competition between the different ports. It is therefore on this issue that effective measures must be adopted because, if we are unable to adopt a suitable solution, then this directive will end in outright failure. And the only outcome will be that some ports are advantaged and others disadvantaged, all due to fine words on the environment leading to a competitive war between ports. The logical solution, for example, would be to establish the principle of a single tariff for all European ports, a tariff that is exactly the same, that would not give rise to any type of distortion in competition, or similar measures. Any decision that, for example, enables the Member States to grant subsidies to the different ports, would end up distorting competition and would ultimately be ineffective. Mr President, I share your love of the sea, and your love of diving and sailing, and I sincerely believe that all those present are concerned about how we can guarantee clean seas for current and future generations. I believe that the work we are discussing today is a great step forward. In this respect, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Bouwman, and the whole of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism for their painstaking work throughout the discussion and throughout the negotiation of this initiative. As you know, the Commission is extremely concerned about marine pollution. I hope that I will shortly be able to provide you with a preliminary package of measures with the aim of monitoring the safety of oil tankers more effectively, measures that I hope we will be able to go on with, specifically making the most of the dramatic sinking of the Erika, a dramatic event which could mean that on this occasion we are able to overcome certain very specific interests that will undoubtedly be affected by the measures I shall be proposing in the near future. However, while it is certain that accidents lead to tremendous problems and disasters, the reality is that most spillages result, not from accidents, but simply from the regular cleaning out of the holds of certain ships, which is obviously a totally reprehensible act.	de
"We must give more responsibility, by way of funding, to local researchers to be able to create development that will be of benefit to the local community and leave the job to them when the financiers have left. We must ensure that no project can be established without input from local researchers. Mr President, the regulation on the table gives the European Union an instrument and the legal - but also the political - responsibility to ensure that the environmental dimension is integrated into development policy. To do this, sufficient financial support is of course necessary. That is why I, like one previous speaker already, advocate voting in favour of the rapporteur's Amendment No 11. Since integrating the environmental dimension is a long-term commitment, I am in principle against limiting the duration of this regulation. However, the arguments that excessively lengthy negotiations with the Council are putting existing projects - projects which are already up and running - at risk have persuaded me otherwise. I also believe that Amendment No 9, which seeks to involve civil society in exchanging information and implementing this regulation, is of fundamental importance, because in my opinion the discussions about civil society and the discussions about good governance must not only be reflected on the political soapbox but also in active policy implementation. In the same way I support the rapporteur's proposal on split comitology, whereby decisions on the strategic guidelines would be decided under a management procedure and those on implementation under an advisory procedure. Hopefully we are reaching the conclusion of a process that started a year ago under the previous Parliament. Apart from the importance of the topic itself, this regulation and the accompanying tropical forests regulation represent the first regulations concerning development cooperation to be considered under codecision. So for many of us this is an interesting learning experience. The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999. Since the beginning of this year, the Commission has been unable to make any new financial commitments on these budget lines. This places the Commission and Europe in an increasingly difficult situation. Hence our desire to conclude the process of adoption in the near future. In this context, we have supported the informal negotiations between the Council presidency and the parliamentary rapporteur so as to arrive at a proposal which could be accepted by both parties. The main areas of difference have been on the financial reference amounts, on comitology and on the duration of the regulation. I would like to comment briefly on each of these issues. On the financial reference amount, briefly, we accept the compromise proposals put forward under Amendment No 11. Comitology: Our position has been to advocate an advisory rather than management procedure for the management of the regulation in accordance with Council Decision 1999/468/EC of 28 June 1999 which states: ""The management procedure should be followed as regards management measures such as those relating to the application of the common agricultural and common fisheries policies; also the implementation of programmes with substantial budgetary implications""."	it
However, if we are simply carrying out a diagnosis of the incoherences in our policy, we will end up totally frustrated and, furthermore, the result will be negative. As with the systems of forces which are studied in basic physics, it makes no sense to implement policies which will cancel each other out. The result of this absurd game is not zero, but rather a minus number, as a consequence of the material, financial and human resources thrown away in a pointless enterprise. With regard to policy, this minus number is multiplied by the number of results which are not achieved each time one measure cancels out the intended effect of another. In today' s globalised world, this fact is all the more obvious. There are no boundaries for Community policies. I am therefore glad that the Commission and the Council are once again taking an interest in the coherence of Community policies, and that, together with complementarity between national and Community policies and coordination between the services of the Commission, they intend to shape the policy on cooperation in accordance with the development of the European Union. Both the Commission and the Portuguese Presidency of the Council state, in their respective working programmes, that they wish to give coherence to those policies which have a very important impact on the developing countries, but they do not specify concrete measures aimed at introducing this coherence. Both institutions identify the most important areas where this idea should be applied. For example, the Commission, in its long term guidelines, says that the objective of sustainable development must be based on a strong sense of solidarity, supported by a commercial policy which takes common interests into account. The Commission is addressing a very important area, that is, commercial policy. However, this Parliament wishes to add policies to aid development, agriculture, fisheries policy, immigration, our position in international financial institutions, the common foreign and security policy and aid for structural reform. The Council - and Mr Luis Amado has said this this morning - has spoken on different occasions of the need for coherence - the last time, it is true, being in November 1999, and also on other occasions, such as the Development Councils of May 1999 and June 1997 - but with no concrete results. Since the Development Council is in agreement with what he says - and this is very significant - there is little we can say, as some previous speakers have pointed out. However, as Parliament, we wish to propose - as others have said and as the resolution states - the creation of an inter-service working group consisting of the people responsible for all the policies mentioned and the establishment of a monitoring centre for the coherence of the different Community policies, which is capable of anticipating the effects of each policy on the developing countries and amongst themselves. What we really want, however, is to be realists and not hide away from the fact that the achievement of these objectives of coordination, complementarity and, the most complex one, which we are discussing at the moment, coherence, will require a more developed policy than the one we currently have in the European Union. Let us hope - and we do hope - to be guided by the winds of change created by the Intergovernmental Conference, the reform of the Commission - which will also affect the development services -, this new legislature and the prospects for enlargement, to perfect a more coherent political union.	de
I was very glad to learn last week that the Commission is giving close attention over a number of years to the concept of subsidiarity and its reference, not merely to relations between the Union and Member States, but also the Union, the Member States, regions and cities. I hope that in his pursuit of dialogue around the regions of Europe, Commissioner Barnier will expand upon that thought and learn from what he hears. Commissioner, I want to go back to one of your previous answers. In this you mentioned what I would refer to as the possibilities of protecting the EU Treaty against any risks of deviation and, in particular, the variation of penalties which may be imposed on a Member State, pursuant to Article 7, for the violation of fundamental freedoms. Do you believe that these proposals, or proposals of this type, form part of the mandate of the IGC as defined in Helsinki? I do not think so. Are you not afraid that such penalties might get out of hand and serve to punish not violations of human rights but simple differences of opinion, unpopular opinions or deviations from the dominant European thinking? Yes, Mr Bonde, we will be starting this debate with 700 young people in Brussels who are going to be working in the institutions and with the Commission. I believe that it will be good to start this dialogue with young people who are motivated. In terms of social protection, I can confirm that we have made proposals about qualified majority or unanimous voting but these are regardless of ideology. In your country, Mr Bonde, like everywhere else, I believe people are keen for the internal market to work properly under the fairest conditions of competition and movement of goods and people. This will therefore be our rule. We are proposing that decisions on certain policies or measures involving taxation or social protection and social security should be taken by qualified majority voting when there is a direct link with the proper operation of the internal market. Our proposal is not general or systematic. I am well aware of the sensitivity of these taxation and social protection issues. I do not believe that all the national systems of social protection should be made identical. This has never been the case. We are simply trying to ensure, in a Europe with 30 or 27 Member States, the best conditions for the operation of the internal market without one country being able to block the other 26 or 27. Mr MacCormick, I agree that this dialogue must reach beyond the national capitals. It must get as close as possible to the people, where they live and where they have their roots. If I said anything different I would be contradicting myself as Commissioner for Regional Policy which is one of the most specific and most visible policies for increasing employment and improving the quality of life of people in their regions. You will often hear me say that this policy does not just have one main objective of achieving cohesion and solidarity between the regions but that it is intended in addition to help people, where they live, to preserve their roots, traditions, soul and identity.	fr
I feel that the two Presidents were right not to include this point in their agendas: there is a time and place for everything and, of course, the priorities are different at different levels. I feel that it was right for the two highest representatives of Parliament and the Commission to tackle the most sensitive issues of the peace process which, as we are aware, is still running into difficulties. We need to lend this peace process our full support, and our concern over the issues described in the question put by Mrs Morgantini is not preconceived, nor is it indicative of a negative attitude towards any of the parties concerned. We are being cruel to be kind. We are being strict with our friend, the Israeli Government, to prevent repetition of these illegal occurrences and irregularities, as they are damaging to everyone involved. Seen in this perspective, this initiative should also be viewed as positive, and as an initiative intended to further the Middle East peace process. Mr President, Commissioner, it is true that the present trade agreement between Israel and the EC is ambiguous. It is also very difficult to establish the origin of the products in question. I can therefore only concur that it is desirable for some light to be shed on the matter soon. There are, nonetheless, a number of other important factors which we need to take into consideration. Indeed, we are all agreed that the recent revival of the peace negotiations must be encouraged and not hampered. Israel and the Palestinians are currently involved in intense negotiations concerning their future borders. Any attempt by anyone, including by any third party, to define - let alone impose - the territorial area to be adopted for trading purposes is therefore premature. In my opinion, it seems preferable to await the findings of the tripartite working group, to be convened on the initiative of Israel, the European Commission and also the Palestinians for the purpose of examining the origin rules. I am pleased that the Commissioner shares this view. Hopefully, this working party will find a temporary solution to the problem within the existing legal framework without jeopardising the peace process. For this peace process deserves absolute priority, and we in the European Community and in Europe should not put any obstacle whatsoever in the way of this process. There seems to be remarkable consensus in the House today but I would like to make a few points. Here in the Parliament trade in the Middle East has always been a political flashpoint. We are major donors but we have, unfortunately been marginalised in terms of policy and political influence for too long in the Middle East and we can contribute positively, as many speakers have said today, just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland. We are major consumers of goods from both Israel and the occupied territories, indeed trade is probably our main political strength in the area and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political asset as we seek to contribute to the peace settlement. Borders are being shut down, sometimes arbitrarily, and sometimes following a terrorist attack.	fr
Under the system proposed in these pieces of legislation, third country nationals wishing to move to the UK under the procedures described, will do so by virtue of the service provision card issued by another Member State, thereby by-passing UK border controls. If there is to be a change to the present United Kingdom border arrangements, that change should be made by the United Kingdom Government and the United Kingdom Parliament and not en passant by the European legislative process. For that reason, we shall vote against both these proposals. Mr President, Commissioner, first and foremost I would like to extend warm thanks to the rapporteur and to Mr Wieland for the efforts they have expended in summing up the various proposed amendments and interests in this report in such a balanced manner. These two proposals contribute considerably to the implementation of one of the four key principles of the internal market for the freedom to provide services. The new regulation for cross-border services will doubtless improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and power to act of enterprises. The strict basic conditions attached to the issue of the EU service provision card - and I am with Mr Wieland on this - are essential, for they will serve to prevent abuses such as illegal entry and bogus contracts. Why do I think we need the directive so much? Three reasons and they are as follows: on account of the economic importance of third-country workers in the EU, in the interests of the competitiveness of enterprises and the proper functioning of the internal market. Therefore, whilst I welcome the strict basic conditions, I would also call for the controls that are to be implemented by the Member States to be made as effective and simple as possible. My last question relates to something people constantly approach me about and is therefore addressed to the Commission. Will the directive prejudice the accession negotiations? How is Article 1 to be interpreted and explained in your view, as this will have important implications, notably for the accession negotiations and for our country, which shares common borders with so many applicant countries? Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, businesspeople have so far had to live with the fact that two of the key freedoms, namely the free movement of people and services, did not apply to them. Indeed, they were still subject to endless bureaucratic immigration procedures of the Member States where a service had to be provided. There are approximately thirteen million third-country subjects who reside within European territory. I assume that, although the exact number of businesspeople included in this figure is not known, their number will most definitely not be low. So, up to now, their access to the entire territory of the Union has not been regulated by Community legislation. The aim of the two present proposals for a directive is to promote the free movement of services within the internal market by means of introducing the EU service provision card.	es
"This issue, which has an impact on their everyday life, is a key issue as regards EU credibility. It has to be conceded that the EU has already aided, I would say quite magnificently, the development of poor countries. I remember what Portugal and Greece used to be like when I drove through those countries for the first time twenty-five years ago. In this connection, French speakers would speak of a ""coup de chapeau"" : in other words, I take my hat off to the EU. The EU really deserves such a gesture, but differences between rich and poor areas within countries are still too great. What is the result? People react by voting with their feet and go where they can earn a crust. Consequently, we have to build schools, hospitals, and the whole infrastructure for the same people in the same country many times over. This is very costly and it also causes very great social problems. Most people, however, would like to live in the area in which they were born and raised, if they were given the chance to, in other words, if there was work there. We must give them this opportunity. This is a moral obligation the EU and all of us have. The solution, as I see it, lies in clearly encouraging entrepreneurship. By entrepreneurship I do not simply mean the ownership of business, but creating will. I mean the attitude where a person wants to get on in life, whether he or she is an employee, the owner of a business or an official. What is a fair society? One in which someone from a modest background can get on in life so as to make life a little easier for his or her children. In this way, positive development of the regions is also possible, because people will start business and will work if they are given the chance. Finally, I would say that in this matter we should learn a lesson from America, where hard work is still in fashion and success is an indication of ability and not the object of envy, as it often is here in Europe. Mr President, as all the previous speakers have done, I should like in turn to thank Mr Berend and congratulate him on the quality of his report. Just like the previous report, this extremely competent and precise analysis, the recommendations it supports and your own comments, ladies and gentlemen, shall prove useful to the Commission in general and to the Commissioner responsible for regional policy in particular at this time when we are involved with the programming of appropriations for 2000-2006. I should also like to make a few comments, firstly, Mr Berend, regarding the assessment you have made of this sixth periodic report. You pointed out the quality of the report and you even wrote, if I am not mistaken, that it marked a real improvement in comparison with previous reports. On behalf of all the officials of the Commission and my predecessor, Mrs Wulf-Mathies, I must inform you that we were very alert to the evaluation made by this House and by yourself."	es
"The German version is not very clear here. I would ask for that to be checked again. For the rest, I warmly thank our rapporteur. It is a difficult subject and I hope we have managed to make it somewhat easier to deal with now. Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. I must add that it is a welcome change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and willing to reach compromises with the other institutions. When it comes to the IGC, she is one of what the French call ""les pures et dures"" : no compromise, no deals with the other institutions; we would rather see the whole thing blocked than compromise our positions. Yet here she is willing to accept the steps forward that have been achieved, which are far from matching Parliament' s original position on the issue of comitology. Let us remember what is at stake here. Parliament had four main criticisms of the comitology system as it existed prior to the new Council decision supplemented by this interinstitutional agreement. Firstly, the whole system is obscure. It is not transparent with hundreds of committees meeting with secret agendas and nobody knowing who is on the committees. Here is a real step forward, in the new system that has been agreed. We are to know who is on each committee. We are to know when they meet. We are to get the agendas. We are to get the documents that are sent to them. The whole system will be more open and transparent - if still rather complex. So that is at least a step forward. Our second criticism is that the system was very restrictive of the Commission. We adopt legislation in the European Union. We expect the Commission to implement it. And then we have a system designed to hinder the Commission and make it more difficult - especially what was called the ""contre-filet"" system, under which the Council could block the Commission by a simple majority even when the Council was not capable of finding an alternative to the implementing measure concerned. Here too there is at least some progress. The Council will no longer be able to block implementing measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period unless it has a qualified majority to block it, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States represented in the Council. That is a more reasonable system. That, too, is a step forward. But on our other two criticisms, we are less satisfied. The first criticism is of the system whereby the Commission is monitored, scrutinised, controlled if you like, only by a committee appointed by Member States or the Council not by Parliament. The legislative authority, Council and Parliament, should be equal. We confer implementing powers on the Commission, but then it is only a Council or Member State appointed body that can blow the whistle and say no to the Commission and stop the implementing measure. Parliament has no equivalent power. True, we are now given the beginning of such a power in this new system."	de
Mr President, today' s debate is extremely important because the principle of competition has probably been the cornerstone of the internal market. In accordance with the principle of competition, the legislation has implemented Articles 85 to 94, competition policy in the strict sense, and the revision of all state aid and tax provisions which may affect competition. Firstly, fiscal provisions of an indirect nature and recently, thanks to Commissioner Monti, there have been direct provisions, the code of good conduct in particular. This has worked fairly well, but, as in the famous film Casablanca 'time goes by' and we must adapt the legislation we have been applying until now to the new circumstances. In this respect I have observed a significant consensus in all the interventions. Firstly, it is necessary, in drawing up the legislation, to produce clear and complete rules. It is probably horrendous, especially in this particular raft of legislation, that there are confused rules, regulatory vacuums and rules that only lay down undefined legal concepts. This is all the worse - as is the case with the second part of this reform - when responsibility for implementing the legislation lies with national authorities. Thirdly, it seems to me important that the Commission should play a role in resisting the temptation to create independent agencies which would distort the very essence of the Commission, in order to guarantee uniform application by international bodies. Fourthly, and lastly - and this has already been mentioned - the international legal order has changed. We have seen this in the aborted Seattle Conference and we are now seeing it in the bilateral conferences with different regions or countries of the world. The principle of competition must now be universal in its application. We must monitor compliance with environmental standards, employment standards, in order to prevent dumping in this area, and we must ensure scrupulous respect for property rights and the revision of state aid, which in many industries - as has already been said - distorts competition and destroys jobs within our own territory. To sum up, we should apply similar conditions that will prevent aid, internal distortions by other countries, from being transferred to the international arena, in other words, through trickery. Mr President, Commissioner Monti, there is much that is good in Mr Jonckheer' s report on state aid for manufacturing industry and certain other sectors. First of all the report reveals Parliament' s single-minded determination to reduce state aid to ensure that the internal market functions flawlessly. Many of the report' s conclusions, however, are cause for concern, at least for our group. For example, the fact that the amount and level of state aid calculated on a per capita basis vary considerably from Member State to Member State reveals the need for surveys such as this. Aid that is based on the self-seeking ambitions of a nation gives companies unfair advantages, thus distorting competition and leading to an ineffective, uneconomic division of Europe' s meagre resources. The form the aid takes is important.	es
It sounds good, saying that access to water should be a human right and ought to be free of charge. But water is not free of charge, any more than houses or food are free of charge. It is only by means of efficient instruments of control that we can arrive at a situation in which water is better managed and more carefully husbanded as a resource. I also want to add that, when it comes to groundwater and to water which has been heavily modified by human activities, I support a tighter timetable and a clarification of goals and of criteria for allowing exceptions to the rules. I also support expressly mentioning radioactive substances. In the course of the debate, many speakers have pointed out how important it is to consult the general public and keep them informed. I just want to emphasise this further. It is absolutely crucial that we involve the general public by keeping them well informed and by proceeding to consult them. This is also expressed in Recital 14. Allow me also to say to Mr Bowe that, in common with my Scottish colleague, he need have no pangs of conscience about continuing to enjoy a glass of Scotch whisky now and again. We have not considered it necessary for the Commission to regulate the very limited abstraction of water for whisky production. Allow me now to comment on some of the areas in a little more detail. Limiting discharges of hazardous substances into our waters must be one of the most important objectives. I am glad to see that Parliament' s amendments have focused upon this. The Commission fully supports the proposal to introduce the commitments under the OSPAR Convention into the text. We must, however, keep to their precise scope and content. As I said, their purpose and the timetable for implementing them are political in character. It would not be in keeping with this to introduce a legally binding timetable. It must nonetheless be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are compelled to take measures to achieve the relevant goals and comply with the timetables. I therefore welcome Amendments Nos 6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88 . The Commission cannot, on the other hand, approve Amendment No 19, in which hazardous substances are defined differently than in OSPAR. The Commission' s proposal introduces a clear procedure for selecting substances, and so no definition is needed. Even if I too agree with the contents of Amendments Nos 79 and 106, these go beyond the commitments under OSPAR, and I cannot therefore approve these Amendments. The Commission can also, in principle, approve Amendment No 60, according to which a timetable is required for implementing the Commission' s proposal to limit discharges of prioritised substances. Amendment No 59 introduces requirements to the effect that the list of prioritised substances should continually be reviewed. This would involve legal uncertainty as to the status of the list and cannot, therefore, be approved. The desire expressed in Amendments Nos 60 and 93 for a list of goals and a list of substances for which no adequate data is available cannot be approved. Lists of this kind would not have clear legal status and do not fit in with the procedures for adopting the list of prioritised substances. I would point out in this regard that the OSPAR Convention does not in any way alter existing Community legislation concerning nitrates from the agricultural sector. The Nitrates Directive will not therefore be influenced by the present framework directive.	de
It should be an extremely constructive contribution to the debate we are conducting. Finally, Parliament recommends, in paragraph 6 of the draft resolution, that a working party should be established in order to bring about coherence. I believe it is only a coincidence, but the Commissioner for the Environment is also, of course, to participate in this group. Let us hope that the debate in which we are now engaged will prove to have been a watershed. Policy so far has been characterised far too much by a process of giving with the one hand and taking away with the other. There are a lot of people who will be watching further developments with great interest. Mr President, the Seattle demonstrators argued that free trade is bad for the less- and least-developed countries, it is purely a rich country selfish interest. Yet we might consider the rate of economic progress and the rate of eliminating poverty in countries such as India and Tanzania over the 40 or 50 years since they became independent. There the theory went that protectionism and state intervention would preserve jobs, allow industry to adjust gradually and without pain. It did not work; poverty became worse than ever. The medicine may not taste too good in the short term, but opening one' s economy to competition at home and abroad forces optimal application of resources and leads to a higher standard and quality of life in the not so longer term. Is that not the lesson of the European Union itself and of the single market in particular? As Mr Nielson said, this is a fine example to those countries and regions aspiring to greater prosperity. Yet preaching the benefits of free trade to the developing countries is not enough. We also have to practise what we preach in our own accessibility for imports from these countries. Parliament' s resolution on the WTO negotiations advocated a free import policy by the EU. Eliminating all remaining barriers to imports, tariff barriers and quotas and, just as important, non-tariff barriers, such as Mrs Maij-Weggen mentioned in her speech - eliminating these barriers would do more than any amount of development aid to secure for developing countries the economic progress which both we and they desire. It is quite clear that a lack of coherence of development policy with trade policy diminishes our development efforts and must also diminish the political regard of the developing countries for Europe and our fine words. Mr President, in the last couple of days we have heard fine words about the need for greater coherence, coordination and effectiveness in the external aid programmes of the Community and of the Member States. There is one relatively small area of activity with enormous public visibility which would be a litmus test of the Union' s ability to match words with action. I am referring to the continuing tragedy of anti-personnel landmines which present an obstacle to so many development programmes, to post-conflict reconstruction, and which ruin the lives of many of the most vulnerable in some of the poorest parts of the world, particularly in developing countries.	it
They are growing, but only in terms of GDP. They are increasing in competitiveness but they are not all experiencing an increase in wealth because there is no increase in employment and there are still differences in employment opportunities between regions. Commissioner, please read the opinion of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs and treat it as a matter of priority, because this is our citizens' greatest problem. Please take account, in strategic terms, in the revision and in the allocation of reserves, of employment needs, because this, fundamentally is what the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Funds require. Mr President, it is important that the guidelines head in the right direction and that they guarantee the effectiveness of the programmes of the crucial seven-year period 2000-2006 so as to ensure sustainable development and job creation, particularly for women and young people, and ensure a balance is struck between economic and social policy and regional policy. It is particularly important to address those serious issues concerning urban areas, employment in rural areas, aid to agricultural regions and equal development opportunities for the islands of the European Union and for the Greek islands which, of course, comprise half of the islands of the Union, as stipulated in Article 158 of the Treaty. Cohesion policy needs to be strengthened further because a Europe which totally disregards the standard of living in its regions can neither be reliable or viable. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to express my great interest in listening carefully to the comments, occasional criticisms and suggestions that some of you have just made in your speeches with reference to Mrs Schroedter' s report. Everyone understands, Mrs Schroedter, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons and the time limits involved - and I shall come back to this point presently - and whatever the time limits or delays, since we are discussing this report right now, as the representative for the Commission, I consider that the report has been issued at an opportune moment with regard to the guidelines for 2000-2006 as it is now that we are starting the new regional programming. Mrs Schroedter, you quite rightly pointed out that while it is chiefly up to the Member States and the regions to define their own priorities in development matters, European Union cofinancing of the programmes requires, and is the justification for, a situation where Community priorities as debated and approved in this House should also be taken into account in order to promote this Community aspect of economic and social cohesion which many of you forcefully pointed out. So, ladies and gentlemen, I should like in a moment to return to the role and structure of the guidelines before mentioning the principal comments and criticisms that you, Mrs Schroedter, and the various Members of this House, have made. Regarding the role and structure of these guidelines, Mr Hatzidakis, Mrs Schroedter and Mrs McCarthy mentioned that the purpose of these guidelines is to assist national and regional authorities in preparing their programming strategy for each of Structural Fund Objectives 1, 2 and 3 as well as their links with the Cohesion Funds. This means putting forward the Commission' s priorities, based on past experience in implementing the programmes, as well as current Community policies relating to structural operations.	de
"Mr President, Commissioner, we should be pleased that this directive has already reached second reading. However, I must say that I am not over-pleased because I believe that this directive is not of great quality, it is going to be very difficult to implement and has many shortcomings. Firstly, I believe that this directive is excessively tough, simplistic and reductionist. In many cases other existing directives on water have not been complied with and governments and the Commission have often not imposed discipline as they should have done, although I know that this is not pleasant. It is not a question of having much tougher regulations, because in many cases the problems concern management. It is not a question of exercising the relevant competences and not referring the big problems of the water systems to the legislative, the complications of which we are all well aware of. This is a reductionist directive. We cannot lump countries with navigable rivers together with countries which lack water, where great cracks open up in the ground through a lack of water and which see temperatures of 55ºC or 60ºC in the sun. I say this because the ball does not need to be in our court. This issue is in the hands of the governments and the Commission. In the same way, this damage and these tragedies which are happening, as in Romania, are not the problem of the legislative, but of the executive and of the governments. Furthermore, it is not a fair directive because it ignores the large uninhabited areas, climatic diversity, desert areas and arid areas. That is how the common position has been worded. The same can be said with regard to transfers. Transfers are an example of the distribution of wealth, of solidarity between peoples and territories, because unfortunately the Earth is not perfect and some areas have more and some have less. Lastly, I am highly critical of the fact that the directive is not accompanied by a study of its impact. It is very easy for us to demand that others assess its impact but, on environmental questions, we should demand it of ourselves and consider how many people, how many farmers, could be ruined by having to pay the costs. Some kind of study has been done which has not even been read, and I believe we should carry out impact studies by way of good political practice, rather than just laying down doctrine. Mr President, through the consolidation of existing directives this framework directive establishes the basic principle of a sustainable water policy in the European Union. It is a framework for the protection and management of our water - surface, ground, transitional and coastal - through the establishment of river basin districts at national and, in our case in Ireland, cross-border level. Ireland is very supportive of the common position and many of the European Parliament amendments. A 25-year roll-out for legislation, for example, is hardly acceptable. We have no difficulty with the ""polluter pays"" principle in relation to the recovery of costs on water usage at industrial, commercial and agricultural level. However, I feel very strongly that as water is life and access to clean drinking water is a basic human right, this directive must allow for a basic domestic water provision free of charge, a quota per household for drinking, cooking and sanitation."	it
That is the successful way to manage change, and I hope the Commission will act to make sure that is put into place. Finally, with the emergence, the resurgence, of the xenophobic Right within the European Union I hope that our institutions together will do their utmost to give reality to Article 6 by using Article 13 to combat discrimination, and Article 137 to combat exclusion. We need to move that agenda forward with great urgency now. The aspirations are fine, President Prodi, we want those aspirations to be matched by action. Madam President, I hope that it is a good omen that there are still a few i's left for me to dot. Mr Prodi, you set great store in your reform efforts on introducing a forward-looking employment policy throughout Europe. However, for the economic sector which I represent, i.e. fisheries, this means change. We need to break away from planned economy subsidies in favour of a liberal policy which fosters personal responsibility. We must reduce protective tariffs in order to safeguard effective capacity utilisation in undertakings in the processing industry. What it comes down to is the competitiveness of the European economy on the world market and the existence of thousands of jobs in the processing industry and offshore fishing. However, I am sure that I do not need to remind you of the importance of a branch of the economy which is both an economic and a social factor, which affects not only Germany but all the coastal regions of Europe. Plus, this branch of the economy is one of the few sectors in which Europe has fully integrated powers to decide and act, which is why we expect to be given a right of codecision here too. This has since been unanimously approved. The fisheries policy is due for review in a few months' time, i.e. at the beginning of the year 2000. So it is somewhat upsetting that there is not so much as a mention of this branch of the economy is this paper. I hope that this is a misunderstanding. Please, Mr Prodi, stand by your word and implement your promises. Madam President, many of the speakers from the Socialist Group have already identified key areas where there are gaps in the Commission' s statement. However, we have acknowledged that this is an innovative and very welcome initiative by the Commission. One area that I want to focus on, in addition to those already identified, is that of cultural diversity in Europe. The introduction to this statement acknowledges under the quality of life section that it is important. But there is nothing in the statement which indicates that the Commission intends to take any steps to deal with the issue of cultural diversity. If we are to ensure that we defeat the fear-mongers amongst us - those seeking power on the backs of anxious citizens - then we must seriously address the question of how we can live together and how we can dismantle the negative stereotypes that we have of each other, both within the present European Union and among those who seek to join us and, indeed, among those in other parts of Europe and the world who want to come and live and work in Europe.	it
According to the Commission, external policy can succeed, provided everyone knows exactly who is in charge! So who is this then? The Commission as a whole, its President perhaps, the Council? You stated that the new European government requires strong institutions, while the Commission wants to focus at the same time on its core tasks. We could not agree more with the latter. It is high time that institutions restricted their scope to actual cross-border issues and stopped decking out the European cart with powers which they are taking away from national authorities. The document mentions common values on different occasions. Unfortunately, I find the reference to the relevant standards to be lacking. This raises the question as to what these standards and values are based on. I am convinced that the Bible, God' s word, is the only pure source of proper standards and real values. In the tradition of our continent, this realisation is an important one which merits recognition. Madam President, I would like to congratulate Mr Prodi and the Commission on their government policy statement. I very much agree with the gist of the document. I also share the view of Mr Prodi and the Commission that in a number of areas, there is a need for more Europe and more integration, and rightly so. Areas such as security, the World Trade Conference, food safety, but also the new economy, require more action, therefore, from the European Commission. It will be a challenge to find a way of bringing the Member States, the Council, the European Parliament, the national parliaments, the Commission and all kinds of other agents into line. The European Commission will need to play an important director' s role in this, provided that clear and attainable objectives are in place. Clear priorities, focus, and, above all, communication with society to inform them of what we are up to, are the key goals. That requires from the Commission, with a view to subsidiarity, concrete plans which we would like to see implemented in the forthcoming programmes. There is, in itself, nothing wrong with emphasising the core functions, and I applaud the fact that the Commission would like to assume a better, more prominent role in order to develop policy ideas and political initiatives. But what also matters is the actual implementation of the Commission' s ideas. Take the Telecom sector, for example. Although we have drafted a large number of directives, at the end of the day, we still have 15 different markets and the 15 Member States still implement the directives differently. And where implementation is concerned, the Commission needs to ensure that our political wishes are also implemented in practice. Looking at foreign policy, Madam President, I very much like the ambition that the European Union should have as much political as economic say at world level. But then I wonder: if there is talk of a real common policy, of a system of crisis prevention and crisis control at Community level, where are the actual proposals then?	es
"There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation. Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see. That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform. If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a ""hand-up"". I urge the House to support these changes. Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work. The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment. These policy objectives can only be achieved through their careful coordination and organisation on the basis of well thought-out and sensible guidelines. Let us not forget that when these policies are effective, they also benefit European citizens by directly improving their quality of life. Let us not forget either that greater consideration should be given to the islands and remote regions of the European Union because their geographical location is a hindrance to their economic and social development, unless of course the Commission is intending to build bridges or underwater tunnels linking them to the European mainland. In closing, I would like to point out that the structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility so that they can adapt to changing circumstances and thereby respond to the new challenges and opportunities of the new millennium, for which we all hope for the best. Mr President, Mrs Schroedter' s report undoubtedly contains several important observations, and I would like to congratulate her on that. However, I feel that we should be a little more concerned about the actual direction and outcome of the Community' s regional policy. Quite briefly, structural policy does not ease the problem of mass unemployment in any way, rather it aggravates it. The agricultural economy and agricultural regions have been irreparably damaged by the existing regional policy, which has had dramatic consequences on employment levels in rural areas and on the living conditions of farmers, particularly in the South."	fr
The Commission gives its full support to the efforts being made in this area and is continuing its investigations into whether specific measures can be implemented in the environmental field. I should, of course, like to take this opportunity to say that I appreciate the role played by the European Parliament' s Committee on Women' s Rights and Equal Opportunities, particularly its chair. I should just like to recall that, during the lengthy process of approving the present Commission, every Commissioner was questioned by the Women' s Committee on how they would tackle the issue of equality within their own particular field. We shall be monitoring each Commissioner carefully, so the other Commissioners have now been forewarned. Thank you for your reply. I interpret it as saying that you agree that what is needed is an action plan to enable more women to take part in specific environmental fields. I should also like to point out that the Beijing Declaration emphasises the importance of having the institutional capacity to introduce a perspective of equality into all environmental programmes. Environmental agencies often do not have the required knowledge or procedures for incorporating such a perspective into their daily work. I naturally want to know whether the Commissioner is willing to incorporate the idea of equality into environmental policy and programmes. This is a crucial goal. In order for all policies to be similarly permeated by the concept of equality, it is especially important that people in key posts should have the basic knowledge required. . (SV) My understanding of mainstreaming is, of course, that this should characterise everything we do. In the action plan prepared by my Directorate-General, issues of equality play a very important role. For example, I am prepared to give seminars on leadership or other subjects myself to encourage women to take on further tasks within the Commission. If we are to be able to motivate everybody, I believe it is extremely important for this message to be sent all the way from the top down or, if you prefer, from the bottom up. My impression of environment-related work, broadly speaking, is that in many instances it is dominated by women. This state of affairs must be encouraged so that women have a chance to secure managerial posts or reach high-ranking positions in the environmental field. I should like to make it plain that our programme reflects that intention, but there is certainly room for improvement. I have some experience in drawing up plans and following them up. I hope that this will be of benefit. Question No 43 by (H-0045/00): Subject: The Boyne Estuary and the Drogheda Port Company The Boyne Estuary is designated a Special Protection Area (SPA) under the Wild Birds Directive and is under consideration for designation as a Special Area of Conservation under the Habitats Directive, as it is an area of international importance. However, the Department of the Marine, Louth County Council and Drogheda Corporation have allowed the development of a new port in the SPA and even the elimination of a mudflat at Stegrennan recently added to the SPA specifically at the Commission's insistence.	fr
Clearly we are awaiting this reform from the Commission, we are awaiting the proposals which the Commission is going to make to us and this Parliament will have to express its opinion on them. Meanwhile, we have to offer the Commission a vote of confidence. 'Long-winded' . I am not going to mention the length of this report. I do not know if it breaks the record for all the resolutions presented here, but, for this type of resolution it certainly does. I do not believe that there has ever been a resolution - and in this Parliament we certainly produce complex resolutions - which has had paragraphs of more than 16 lines without a single full stop. It is also 'confusing' . I am not going to return to what has been said about the analysis of questions concerning Parliament. That should be the subject of another report and we will have to carry one out and consider that issue, but not in this report. And finally, Mr President, frankly, I am not going to give examples, but there are many cases in which legal language is used with an alarming lack of accuracy. Therefore - in summary - I await, and many of us await, your report, Commissioner Kinnock, so that we can really express our opinion on it, which is the duty of this Parliament. Mr President, the scope and highly detailed nature of the proposals for necessary reform measures show just how important these reforms are. When one considers the events that have set these endeavours in motion though, it is only too clear as to why there is a need for them. Hopes and expectations were raised higher still by the strong messages sent out by Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in plenary and in the Committee on Budgetary Control. The concept of transparency stands out in the report. Securing this is a major priority. The importance of smooth-running, comprehensible work cannot possibly be emphasised enough. This is not just about bureaucratic reform, however; rather, it is about showing good will towards the citizens. We must win back their faith in EU politics. The citizens demand rapid and open access to the institutions and call for EU provisions to be comprehensible to them. This is what enables them to understand what is going on. They want to see the politics of success and believe that this is how any politically mature citizen could expect to be served Whether or not the reforms succeed depends, to a very large extent, on the Commission' s own initiative. However, it annoyed me when I heard today that the Commission is now saying that it only wishes to discuss the interim report with Parliament on an informal basis. However, Mr Kinnock, your presentation to the Committee on Budgetary Control this coming Tuesday must not just be a one-way street; rather, as Parliamentarians, we want, and must, play a part in this and it also goes against my understanding of politics when I find that yet another press conference has taken place this week, before we have had chance to carefully discuss the submission in the competent Committee on Budgetary Control. I believe, Mr Kinnock, that notwithstanding all the success achieved on a personal level, the Commission still has quite a lot to do to satisfy our justifiably high expectations. Can I begin by stating for the record and for the enlightenment of Mrs Langenhagen that the decision for me not to address the full plenary tomorrow and therefore be available for formal responses on the report is not mine and not the Commission's - it was the decision of this Parliament!	es
That concept I reject firmly, because competition is there for the citizens, and for them alone. Most companies hate competition. Competition is run and managed in the interest of the citizens, their economic interest and for their liberty. The examples of liberalisation and competition in air transport and in telephony services in Europe show that citizens have benefited from this. I can only say again that Commissioner Bolkestein will be able to address all the concerns on Monday, in the appropriate committee, more competently and in much more detail. Thank you very much, Commissioner. Pursuant to Rule 42(5), I have received a motion for a resolution to close the present debate. The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. (Parliament adopted the resolution) EXPLANATIONS OF VOTE We voted in favour of the resolution because we received a request to this effect from a French postal service trade union which was looking to obtain, in the event of a favourable vote, an additional time frame in which to defend employees. This does not mean that we approve the entire contents, which are too vague and which leave out the main concern. The policy undertaken by the European institutions and by national governments, especially the French government, is a retrograde policy, counter to the interests of both the service users, i.e. the great majority of the population, and the postal service workers. Postal services must continue to be public services. All people, regardless of their location or social status, must have access to the postal service on an equal footing and subject to the same conditions. In organising the public service no consideration must be given to the idea of profitability, and private firms must not be authorised to amass private profits by carrying off the most profitable public service activities. Consequently, the post office and its equivalents in the various countries of Europe must keep their monopoly of this service. In order to ensure that we have proper postal services on the European Union level, it is essential to put an end to the policy of closing down local post offices, reducing the number of deliveries and overworking postal staff. The post office and, more generally, all public services must, on the other hand, recruit additional staff. Such jobs are unquestionably useful, and creating an adequate number of them would reduce unemployment in Europe. Mr President, personally I voted in favour of this resolution, because the essential thing is that the European Parliament should discuss the postal service and we should get away from the current ambiguous situation. If we dismantle the public service, this would be very serious, and we wish to know what are the Commission' s intentions. Saying that the client will receive a better service at a lower cost is patently inaccurate. People who live a long way from civilisation will clearly not receive a better service or else they will then have to pay a great deal and some of them will not be in a position to do so.	fr
"If we are to increase the rate of employment and fund our social security systems, we will have to have a longer working life and, above all, we will have to have more and better trained women in work. We therefore hope that this Lisbon Summit will help to change the present model of female employment. I would like to ask you, Mr President, if you envisage this summit yielding conclusions which will enable specific, timetabled measures to be adopted so that there are not only more women in the world of work, but above all, in the new knowledge economy? Ladies and gentlemen, I am extremely grateful for the excellent and highly pertinent contributions you have made during this debate on the preparation for our Lisbon Special Summit. I think that we needed to have this debate and we also needed to involve Parliament, because in my opinion Europe still lacks strategic direction. In order to achieve this strategic direction, there must be an institutional alliance which transcends the natural differences of political opinion. This alliance has in fact been given form in the excellent contribution that Romano Prodi' s Commission has just made to the preparations for the Lisbon Summit with their paper. The fact that Parliament has a crucial role to play in this is also important. At the Lisbon Summit, in addition to agreeing on a strategy, I would like us to define a set of measures and an open form of coordination. Let me give two examples which relate to everything that has been said here about the practical measures I would like to see adopted. One is that by 2002, all of Europe' s schools and training centres should be connected to the Internet and that they should at the same time have appropriately trained staff to provide the training which young people leaving secondary education need. I also would also like to see everyone receiving professional training, whether they are unemployed or not, to be able to gain a kind of ""driving licence"" for the information society, which will enable them to operate computers and navigate the Internet. If this happens, we will then be providing a framework under which information technology is not a cause of social division, that is to say of a widening in the gulf between those who succeed and those who fail. On the contrary, it will be a major vehicle for integration and for combating social exclusion. My second example is this: a great deal has been said about the participation of women in the labour market and about equal opportunities for women and men in society in general. Practical measures relating to what I spoke about earlier - a common goal for support services for families and particularly for children - are a key factor in creating jobs and at the same time creating equal opportunities and ensuring much greater participation by women in the labour market. We need practical measures like this, but we also need a form of coordination that will enable us, as part of the various approaches that have been referred to here, to ensure that the European institutions and governments adopt joint action programmes and have quantifiable and verifiable instruments to facilitate this coordination."	es
We must thank those who, while defenceless and lacking in resources, have battled courageously against the grave effects that this disaster has had on coastal regions, the marine ecosystem and European fishing stocks. Mr President, as chairman of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I should like to congratulate the Commission, and in particular Commissioner Loyola de Palacio, for her reaction to this incident, which has really shaken the whole of Europe. We, as the Committee on Transport, are prepared to discuss the Commission communication on the question of safety at sea and, of course, we are likewise prepared to discuss, at a later date, the legal implications of this communication. In addition, I should like to make a number of comments: First, the Commission was right to concentrate its investigation on the liability of RINA, the Italian shipping register, because we need to know if Community law was applied. That should be the starting point for our efforts. Secondly, apart from the shipowners' liability, it would be a good idea in such cases to examine the liability of the charterers, for example the oil companies which are also responsible for causing ecological disasters like this and, of course, for restoring the damage. Once we have done that, our reaction to the ecological disaster is fully justified. However, this should not lead us to accuse the whole merchant marine, which is an important sector of the economy, covering as it does 1/3 of transport requirements, which is why our reaction needs to be measured: strict, but correct. I have no objection to examining an amendment making Community law stricter but, as other members have stressed, we need to start with application, because there is already a legal framework at European Union level and we must not lose sight of that fact. This legal framework is fairly advanced, at least if you compare it with what is happening at worldwide level and the Member States, under the supervision of the Commission, should endeavour to ensure that Community law is actually applied. Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that the unfortunate incident involving the Erika should in fact, as others have said this afternoon, constitute a decisive watershed which will see the end to this type of accident in the European Union where, since 1967, there have been seventeen accidents involving large oil tankers; more than one every two years. The economic and social damage, which we have spoken about today, in terms of the loss of jobs and fishing and tourist resources, is so great that they fully justify decisive and thorough action on the part of the Community institutions. Commissioner, I would also like to thank you for the speedy response of your department to this event and the measures which are being adopted and implemented. I trust that these measures will, in a few months, give rise to a clear and convincing legal instrument - a directive, possibly - which will put an end, once and for all, to these 21st Century pirates, who deprive us all of the wealth and beauty of the sea.	es
In addition, the agreements with the EU will act as an anchor. They will lock in the economic reforms, just as national and economic reforms will be stabilised by both parties' commitments under the agreements. The rationale behind this new approach is also based on the idea that open trade policies combined with social development policies will lead to economic growth and poverty reduction. Another important aspect is the improvement of the EU' s trade regime for all least-developed countries, 39 of which are actually in the ACP group. This process will take place in the coming five years so that, by 2005, the LDCs' exporters will have free access for essentially all their products on the EU market. As regards the volume of the next EDF, the EU has made its financial proposal. It is based on the principle of reconciling the need to maintain a substantial amount of financial resources in a period of limited official development assistance budgets with the need to make Community aid more effective. Today about EUR 9.5 billion of previous EDF resources are uncommitted. The EU is committed to mobilising these remaining balances, plus the new EDF resources, over a seven-year period, that is to say, before the entry into force of the next financial protocol. This will enable the Community to substantially increase annual flows of commitments and payments during this period. We are thus not moving into a period in the coming years of reduced activity, we are moving into a period of increased activity. Such a commitment entails an in-depth reform of procedures and implementation modalities on both sides. There is a very real link between the reform process in the Commission as such, and our ability to deliver on the ground which is the basis of the deal with the ACP countries. Turning to our development policy, I would say that the global context has changed drastically. The marginalisation of many economies, increased poverty in the world, the need for better management of environmental interdependence, the destabilising effects of migration and the worrying consequences of armed conflicts and pandemic diseases are all major concerns. It is within this changing global framework that we have to position ourselves. Fortunately evaluations of EC aid give us a meaningful tool to improve what we are doing and also hopefully to meet the challenges I have just mentioned. To focus on the input coming from the evaluations, I would mention the following problems: the objections of Community policy are too numerous and too vague and this adversely affects coherence. This is due to the complexity of our own structures, but also to very real inconsistencies between sector policies and interests in the Member States. The Commission has an aid system that is too complex and fragmented in terms of instruments, procedures and institutional mechanisms. Often policies are more determined by the instruments available, than by policy objectives and clearly-defined priorities. Human resources are too thin in relation to the volume of aid that we are supposed to manage.	fr
But we have the impression that this growth, sustained firstly by the performance of the United States, and then by the productivity gains of the new economy, by the new information and communication technologies, is driven by the general world situation, even despite our handicaps. We are well aware of these handicaps, which must be remedied urgently - the structural inflexibility, the excessive mandatory levies. But let us not forget that there is another one, a new handicap, with the single currency. In fact, the unification of monetary policies and the gradual alignment of other policies imposes additional inflexibility on the different countries in the euro zone by making them behave in ways that are not necessarily suited to their structures and to their respective economic circumstances. This unification is considered to be positive by the Commission' s report. But, in reality, we can no longer rule out the fact that it will lead to a less than optimum global situation. If you add the strangeness of a single currency that is not built upon a State, itself based upon a people, you can easily explain what remains a great mystery in Brussels, the markets' suspicion of the euro. Indeed, it was possible to welcome the weakness of the single currency initially in 1999, as it favoured growth in an unexpected way, but you cannot for ever hide the fact that it is, in fact, symptomatic of bad policies and bad operating conditions. Mr President, the present draft resolution is controversial. Given the topic it covers, this is hardly surprising. It is, after all, a fact that economists agree to disagree on most things, especially where the future is concerned. The carefree appeal made by the rapporteur for higher economic growth seems an attractive way of fighting high unemployment, but it is, in fact, a short-term policy. Even if he advocates sustainable growth, sustainability does not come into it. Given the environmental and demographic developments, if anything, we ought to encourage Member States to pursue a selective economic growth policy. More investments, production and consumption only generate short-lived prosperity. The use of energy and scarce raw materials should be drastically reduced Other priorities are the repayment of high public debt and restructuring pension schemes. If Member States do not do anything about this, there will be even fewer means for care, education and other important public amenities in the future. An appeal in favour of a more pro-active government policy comes across as very odd. It does not take into account the latest Eurostat reports regarding rising inflation which, at 2%, is now at its maximum permitted level. If, despite this, there is a desire to increase public spending, then those who go down this path will find that it is not long before the European Central Bank raises interest rates again. What the government can then achieve in the way of job creation will be cancelled out by the unfavourable developments for small and medium-sized enterprises, in particular. High unemployment in the European Union concerns all of us, especially now that the downward trend does not seem to be persisting.	fr
"I believe it would truly be preferable to secure a peaceful resolution to the problems in Cyprus before admitting this country to the European Union. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Commissioner, the view of the Greek Communist Party is that the main problem of Cyprus is not its accession to the European Union but the occupation of 40% of its territory by Turkey, which has continued for 26 years. Regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot, the future of the Cypriot people must involve the unity of that small country. The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, that leaves no room for foreign interventions, like those that led to all the problems of the last fifty years, is a unified and federal Cyprus in accordance with the resolutions of the UN' s Security Council. The key to solving the Cyprus problem is in the hands of the Turkish Government, which supports and encourages the intransigence of the Turkish Cypriot leader Raouf Denktaº. For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical professions of interest in freedom and human rights, has never been moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of Greek and Turkish Cypriot refugees, by the enforced change of the population composition in the north of Cyprus, or by the wholesale settlement of colonists by Turkey in the occupied areas. Even in this Chamber, the Council' s representative referred to the north of Cyprus and not to the occupied territories. The recent Helsinki decision to grant Turkey accession country status, even though it has made not the slightest concession over the issue of its occupation of Cyprus, for example, by reducing its military presence there or giving back Ammokhostos, is clearly encouraging Turkey' s intransigence. It is not by chance that, immediately after Helsinki, the Turkish Prime Minister, Bulent Ecevit, stated that the Cyprus issue had been resolved in 1974. Encouraging Turkish intransigence certainly does not help to bring the two communities closer together in the intimate talks under the aegis of the UN Secretary General. On their course towards accession, the people of Cyprus have already lost a great deal, but stand to lose even more. The application of the acquis communautaire has created serious problems for the Cypriot economy, especially in agriculture. It entails the liquidation of the public sector, and it dislocates and destroys the developed system of social solidarity that exists in Cyprus. Mr President, I beg your pardon, but the French interpreter made a small error, on the most sensitive word in the debate, during the translation of what Mr Alyssandrakis just said. I just want to ensure that there is no ambiguity. Mr Alyssandrakis was translated as saying ""the confederate solution would be best"" . Obviously, he said ""the federal solution would be best"" . It is a most important point and needs to be clarified, Mr President. Thank you very much for the clarification Mr Wurtz. Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of mainland Europe. The Maltese in particular have been very good at surviving in hostile geographical and geopolitical environments. Their success has relied in great part on their enterprise, their dynamism and their flexibility. Malta has vibrant light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, magnificent tourism and an amazing range of employment opportunities, all of this on an island virtually barren of natural resources."	de
With regard to the parliamentary procedure, I would like once again to thank all of those who have acted and spoken, especially the rapporteur, because the majority of Parliament' s amendments have been incorporated into the proposal accepted by the Council, in this case practically all of them, although with some modifications. I would also like to express my gratitude because an improvement on the initial offer of funds has been achieved. This improvement has been achieved with fresh funds, as we said at the time, and it has been achieved while safeguarding this Parliament' s prerogatives and competences. From the point of view of the Commission, in this interinstitutional game, I believe that this is important and I am very happy to highlight it. I would like once again to thank all the speakers, and also, especially, the Vice-President, Mr Provan, for his magnificent work throughout this debate, particularly during the conciliation procedure, as well as the chairman of the Committee on Industry and, also, above all, the rapporteur, Mrs Ahern, and all the Members who have participated in this work. Thank you, Commissioner. The debate is closed. The vote will take place at 11 a.m. tomorrow. CULTURE 2000 The next item is the report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr Graça Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament delegation to the Conciliation Committee, on the joint text approved by the Conciliation Committee for a European Parliament and Council decision establishing a single financing and programming instrument for cultural cooperation ('Culture 2000') (C5-0327/1999 - 1998/0169(COD)). Madam President, I actually feel that we ought not to have continued discussing this because we said everything there was to say in the last debate. Unfortunately, there has been no change in the way that the Council always talks about culture but fails to allocate any money for it. We have the feeling, and are in fact convinced, that the Member States would be more than happy to withdraw the things they wrote in 1992 in the Treaty of Maastricht. For no one is very keen to spend money on culture. Sadly that is the case and we must face facts. I would like to thank the rapporteur, who really has chipped away tirelessly at this monumental task, in conjunction with the Commissioner of course. We simply had to take on board the fact that whilst we actually attained our goal in terms of content, of course the same could not be said of the financial aspect. One seems powerless in a dialogue of this kind, where the other party actually has to reach a unanimous decision. What kind of horse-trading system is this? Certainly not a fair one! There are always people who are in a position to reject everything and there we are on the other side, begging for a little more money for culture. It is downright scandalous what goes on! It is an awful sort of horse-trading, based on unequal positions! Nevertheless, we are pleased that this programme has turned out in the way that we wanted it to. It lives up to the expectations the citizens have of us. We will support small and medium-sized events, not the large ones, and we will afford individual citizens and also the smaller operators easier access.	fr
I therefore propose that this House agree to adopt the proposals on SAVE and the conclusion at the conciliation at third reading. I would like to remind the House that at second reading Parliament adopted this report containing eight amendments, including a re-instatement of the Commission' s original budget. The Commission accepted five of the proposed amendments including the budgetary allocation and I thank the Commission for their continued support on the budget during the conciliation procedure as what the Council had proposed was unacceptable. During the procedure, agreement was reached on the studies and actions to devise, implement, complement and assess the Community measures. Compromise wordings were agreed for five other amendments including legislative and non-legislative measures and the inclusion of local energy centres and, very importantly, the energy audit systems in the review of progress on energy efficiency. I hope that you will all agree that this is important progress. The issue of the financial envelope was staunchly defended by Parliament in the face of the Council' s very meagre opening offer. In the event we had to have several meetings before the Council finally increased this to a substantial amount. We got an increase of 2 million on their starting figure which was a decisive increase which I can recommend to you and which the Commission confirmed that it could implement the programmes under. This was an important consideration for us. I would like to say however that it is, and has always been, a very modest budget and therefore the funding for this programme is more symbolic than real. Funding for energy saving still comes primarily from the Member States. We have to bear that in mind when approving this programme. If there is more symbolism than reality in what we can achieve at Community level, this is a pity because there is a lot of enthusiasm at local level for action, including Community actions, on energy saving. Where the Community can step in is to put the local activators in touch with each other so that they can actually not re-invent the wheel in every region. We have an important part to play in the Community in the European Union in this regard. SAVE is the only Community-wide programme dedicated to promoting the rational use of energy. It focuses on non-technical elements, helping to build energy efficiency infrastructure, and the purpose of the programme is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency will be promoted. Here we need to realise that there is also a market opportunity in industry for energy savings. We have heard a lot about difficulties of competition in renewable energies but energy efficiency saves money for business, saves money all round in fact and therefore it should be non-problematical. It is something that we can all support. I have to say, like motherhood, although we all support it, sometimes we do very little substantially and concretely to help the mothers or the people engaged in energy-saving. We could do rather more, considering that we have made great commitments in reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases and to reduce dependence on energy imports.	es
A second round of conciliation achieved an increase of EUR 1.1 million in order to reach this compromise figure of 77 million. In spite of an increase of 3 million in relation to the initial proposal, personally, once again I deplore the fact that the funds allocated do not match up to the ambitions expressed and that the concern to save money displayed by the Council in this situation is in rude contrast to its declarations in favour of the safety of the energy supply, job creation and environmental protection, challenges that are just as significant which we must face up to. In fact, renewable energies unquestionably provide a way of achieving these objectives. However, in spite of the reservations I am expressing on the paucity of the financial allocation, I personally support the compromise, by virtue of the programme' s content, to which the European Parliament made an active contribution as, following the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector become subject to codecision. It is practically certain that, with the raft of proposed measures and actions, it should be possible to approach the objective of a 12% renewable energy share by 2010, doubling the current rate, as long as the appropriations including state appropriations are made available. This programme, together with the SAVE II programme, integrating the environmental aspect into energy policy, establishes a foundation for a real Community strategy to achieve clean energy while reducing our dependence. And, in conclusion, Mr President, let me also insist upon the fact that, in addition to the measures proposed, there are also legislative measures and, most especially, adequate budget allocations to back up these political initiatives. And I shall end, of course, by congratulating Mr Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the committee and of the Conciliation Committee. . (ES) Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I wish to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the ALTENER II programme in the Conciliation Committee and associate myself with the comments of the different speakers and, of course, point out that this agreement will allow the ALTENER programme to be incorporated soon into the framework energy programme. All of this will provide greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programmes, into which we will also have to incorporate the SAVE programme, which we will be discussing soon. I would like to say that the work carried out during this time by Parliament has been of a high quality, and I therefore congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen and also all the various speakers who have spoken both in committee and here in plenary. Obviously, there have been arguments, we had to go to conciliation, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reminded us a moment ago, since at the first meeting no result was achieved, and there had to be a second meeting, despite the fact that the figures were not excessive. However, I believe that in the end we have reached a reasonable agreement, which, like all agreements, is perhaps not perfect, but which, I believe, allows us to push ahead with the projects with which we were dealing. I would therefore like once again to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr Langen, on his work, to thank the speakers and, of course, to acknowledge the actions of Vice-President Provan throughout the conciliation procedure, who contributed efficiently to the achievement of a positive result.	it
The European Union is discussing issues on which it hopes that China will take concrete measures, and on the basis of these discussions the presidency will convey to the Chinese authorities the message that the European Union hopes China will announce positive measures at the session on 25 February. The presidency will also present to the Chinese authorities a list of individual cases on which it intends to express its serious concern. The meeting held in Beijing in October 1999 confirmed that, on the one hand, the Chinese authorities were willing to make concessions on issues relating to the dialogue itself, with a restructuring of the dialogue and of discussion of legal forms of repression such as the death penalty and administrative detention. On the other hand, they will not give any ground on the pivotal questions of the single party system and territorial integrity. Discussions within the European Union about the situation in China following the outcome of the dialogue rounds in 1999 have led the European Union to decide to express its concern about human rights violations in China more firmly; the same applies to the absence of concrete outcomes from the dialogue, while recognising the positive steps that China has made on the international stage. On various occasions the European Union has reiterated to the Chinese authorities its disappointment with the results of the dialogue, and has stressed that it hoped for better outcomes in certain more sensitive areas. It was decided that the dialogue should continue, but in a more targeted and effective way, given that China has agreed with the European Union' s proposal to restructure the dialogue by means of better use of experts and to establish a closer link with the seminars. Lastly, during the next Human Rights Commission there will also be a debate on rationalising the work of the Commission itself. A working party has been set up with the express task of revising the Commission' s mechanisms. This working party has worked hard to reach agreement that it is essential to enhance the effectiveness of the present mechanisms and to make them more rigorous, especially in the financial field. The European Union will oppose any spurious attempt to use this reform of the Human Rights Commission' s activities to limit its capacity for intervention by restricting its sphere of influence and its ongoing monitoring of all human rights issues at world level. . Mr President, I would like to thank the presidency for the work it has done to prepare for Geneva on subjects like racism, civil and political rights and the right to development. As the presidency said, much remains to be done, despite the understandable request by Parliament and many NGOs that the European Union should set out its position well in advance of the Geneva session. That is easier said than done - we are still discussing some of the toughest issues. For example, discussion is taking place about many of the matters raised in Parliament' s resolution and it is too early to predict the outcome in all cases. It is not surprising that the debate is long and difficult.	de
In this context, the European Union must consider, as it began to do early this week, how to include the neighbouring Yugoslavia in regional cooperation in spite of everything, i.e. without taking back any of our criticism of this terrible regime. Tomorrow morning I will therefore table an amendment urging that we concentrate the sanctions on the regime itself while easing them somewhat for the people and for the economy in a spirit of economic cooperation. In that regard allow me to say, since I come from a country through which the Danube flows, that I am grateful that the Commission, i.e. Commissioner Patten and also Vice-President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, is considering opening the Danube to shipping again. That would provide for a modicum of economic recovery in this region too, which, of course, would be of particular importance to Romania. In my view, this regional approach, provided it is understood correctly, i.e. as a method of contributing to economic recovery in the region itself, is in fact the right one to adopt. As I said, it must not be perceived as a constraint nor must it be set as a precondition. Secondly, let me say quite clearly and plainly that we want to open the way to and offer FYROM accession to the European Union. In our view, it would be an illusion to think there was any point in FYROM applying for accession right now, but it would also be wrong to delay discussing it until some later date. FYROM wants to be told here and now that, in principle, accession will be possible when the time is right. This country is afraid it will be in a sense sidelined. It sees, in the whole readjustment of aid instruments, a risk that it will no longer be the last carriage of a train heading towards Europe but that this train will continue through Europe while leaving FYROM on a siding. I think Commissioner Patten understands that too. So I very strongly urge him to make it clear in the appropriate talks. Thirdly, I believe that, so far at least, FYROM has shown that it is capable of using the various instruments properly. Even though there will of course be readjustments here, FYROM will continue to show that many of the tasks that are still being dealt with in Brussels today can in future be handled in Skopje, in the country itself. I hope that the honourable Members will agree to support these proposals as a sign of goodwill towards FYROM. Mr President, since the start of the Yugoslav wars, the Republic of Macedonia - I prefer to use this abbreviation - has behaved as a constructive peace-keeper. We would remind you of the proposals made by the governments of Macedonia and Bosnia and Herzegovina at the time, which had non-violent liberalisation and a non-violent separation from the Yugoslav federal structure in view. As you can see, our Macedonian friends have always played a very positive role and it is for this reason that it should be pointed out at this stage that Macedonia is not just a pawn in our so-called strive towards stability, but actually took the initiative.	de
We might well wonder why 76% of Belgian citizens have no faith in the justice system in their country or why 56% of French citizens have no confidence in their country' s system of justice, and 53% of Italian citizens have absolutely no confidence in Italian justice... (The President cut the speaker off) Madame President, my group, the EDD, and especially my party, are very concerned by this debate. We cannot, and we do not, support in any way the sentiments and politics of Herr Haider and we deplore his references to the Third Reich. We also, however, deplore the fact that your Parliament should consider interfering in the policies of an elected government of any country, especially one which is part of the European Union. My party at home are certainly not racists, but we do not accept the rule or interference of the European Union very well. Are you going to interfere with Great Britain' s Parliament if we are elected? Madame President, the people of Austria have spoken by electing Herr Haider to their Parliament. I believe they gave him 28% of the vote so there is going to be a coalition government. Your Parliament, may I suggest, Madame President, should wait to see if the party of Haider has an effect on the policies of that country. Then, and only then, might you consider if human rights are affected. Your Parliament may consider measures appropriate to counter that situation and then, Madame President and only then, may your Parliament consider interfering in the constitutional affairs of a country of the European Union. Madam President, as a representative of the Freedom Party, I respect the concerns some of my fellow MEPs have with regard to the democratic developments in Austria. My reaction may come as a surprise when I say that I personally am at a loss as to the heightened sensitivity displayed towards Austria in matters of respect for human rights, having a sense of responsibility for one' s own past, and the stability of democracy. Austria must take the responsibility on its own shoulders for the often dubious image other countries tend to have of it, rightly or wrongly. The refusal of our government, down through the years, to acknowledge our complicity in the horrors of the Second World War, together with their refusal to properly compensate the Jewish victims and those forced into hard labour, have done a great deal to bolster this negative image. This FPÖ has now entered into a coalition with the ÖVP, due to the outcome of elections held on 3 October 1999, when the previous government was voted out of office. This is the citizen of a state' s prerogative, for it is the founding principle of a democracy. When the talks between the SPÖ and ÖVP broke down, the Socialists attempted to form a minority government and asked the FPÖ for their support. We were offered three ministerial posts - you can read it for yourself in the newspapers - the very party that is being denounced as fascistic here! When we suddenly refused this offer, an inflammatory and rabble-rousing propaganda campaign began that is beyond our comprehension to this day.	fr
In terms of trade and agriculture, in particular, the European policy is in conflict with the development policy. We seem unable to make a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries. This has everything to do with the difference of opinion which exists among various countries within the Union regarding development cooperation. We should no longer view development cooperation as an instrument of external and foreign relations, but as a policy in its own right. I advocate transparent, joint and efficient development policy. As long as the European approach to the development issue creates more inefficiency and wastes more money, it remains appropriate to apportion a larger role to the Member States. Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the document I referred to to the European Parliament as soon as possible, so that we can help think of possible solutions in a constructive way. Mr President, Commissioner, I believe that this is an appropriate initiative and that it makes very good sense. As various Members have already commented, we often encounter situations where there is an enormous contradiction between our intentions in terms of development and cooperation policy and the damage we inflict with our other sectoral policies, whose objectives run counter to development in those countries. And we are not just talking about the concrete impact of our common policies, tourism, the environment, agriculture, fisheries and industry. We are talking in general terms - and this is more serious - about contradictions between our economic and trade policies and our defence policies. So there is a whole raft of contradictions. In my opinion, these contradictions are not all that serious in terms of Community policies. They are, if anything, more serious as regards certain objectives and industries in some Member States. We have to be aware of this. We often adopt resolutions on peace processes in other parts of the world, as was recently the case with Indonesia, when we protested at the top of our voices only to discover subsequently that some European countries had been supplying them with arms and military equipment. For me, these are the most serious contradictions in all this, more serious than the contradictions inherent in any incompatibility between sectoral policies. We obviously know that, even within any one country, there are always contradictions between various policies. That is a fact of life. And we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the various Community policies, in this case development policy. We have to be aware that these contradictions exist and that we need to minimise them. The underlying reason for presenting this resolution is that the objective of minimising these contradictions is a fair and wise one. I believe that it is both proper and fitting to set up a centre for monitoring this coherence between Community policies and development and cooperation policy, and that this monitoring centre' s sphere of activity should not be limited just to Community policies, but should also cover Member States' actions and policies, including the actions of economic groups, which I think are also important.	it
Mr President, it is universally recognised that rules must be observed. It is also universally recognised that our partners must also be made to observe the same rules. Everyone understands that there is concern about this today, but I would not like our demand to be regarded as selectively applicable. Nor would I like our oral question to be perceived as an indictment. Our demand is not selectively applicable and the Commission should therefore regard this as a suggestion to look into the use of Community funds in regions around Israel. And because the Commission' s investigation is not, and must not be perceived as, an indictment, I should like to mention two points which are central to the balance of our approach. Firstly, anyone familiar with the region knows that the future of the Palestinian economy is intimately linked to the economic cooperation agreement with Israel. The Oslo protocol envisages an integrated customs authority to encompass both Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Anything liable to separate the two economies would have a serious effect on cooperation between Israel and Palestine, including joint ventures, Palestinian sub-contractors and exporters. Secondly, nowhere in the agreements between Israel and the European Union are the frontiers of the State of Israel defined. The negotiations in progress between Israel and the Palestinian Authority are specifically concerned with defining these frontiers. Any attempt on the part of the European Union to impose its own idea of the territorial limits of the State of Israel would be, at the very least, lacking in tact and detrimental to these talks and to the idea of the role which we feel Europe should have in this region. I support the cautious approach which the Commissioner has taken and is taking in this matter, firstly because this is not a simple issue. It is complicated; it is always difficult to determine the origin of any goods and where they come from. No less so in the Middle East because there you have a situation where there are many joint ventures between Israel and Palestinians, where produce in some cases is partly manufactured in the Palestinian area and in the State of Israel and these developments are good things, they augur well for the future because if trade is being done in this way in the Middle East, then that will be the bedrock of any peace agreement. Therefore, because it is not an easy and simple issue, we have to be cautious and we have to be careful. The second reason why the Commission is right to proceed in this way is that if the European Union wishes to play a part in the area in securing peace then it must be seen to be fair and evenhanded. It would not be fair and evenhanded to rush into a decision without letting the talks and the groups that it is meeting determine what the situation is, both in terms of the area of the State of Israel relating to the trade agreement and, as I say, in relation to the goods and where they come from at the same time. There is I think one final reason why the Commission should be supported. We are at a delicate stage in relation to the peace agreement. You have a government in Israel which wants peace and wants to secure peace and if you proceed in a rash and rapid way then you could jeopardise the success of that peace agreement. You cannot cherrypick in negotiations, this is part of an overall settlement of some extremely complicated issues and I think the Commission is absolutely right to let these things flow through carefully in the hope that by doing so we can secure what all of us want and that is a secure and just and durable peace in the Middle East.	de
"In this light, the events we are seeing in Austria must be seen as tragic. For the first time since the Second World War, a party which is openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic has gained access to power in a European country. Confronted with this threat, which carries with it the negation of the very idea which lies at the heart of the construction of Europe, nothing must deter us: not the legal quibbling about what the treaty does or does not permit, not the legitimate questions about the right to intervene, not the derisory respect for formal democracy, and, above all, not the feeling of powerlessness which grips us in the face of an event which we reject with all the force of our convictions but which we are powerless to control. As the representative for a French overseas department, the island of Réunion, a land of racial and ethnic intermixing, where the population has been forged in the course of the last three centuries by the successive contributions of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, enlisted men from India or Pakistan, or even Chinese, every day I experience the profound truth of the remark by Saint-Exupéry, ""In being different to me, you are not doing me harm, brother, but enriching me!"" This human diversity is our main sources of wealth, and this is the reason why it is my duty to track down and to condemn anything which may be harmful to it, wherever it may exist. For all these reasons I voted most decidedly in favour of the resolution before this House on the formation of the government in Austria. Jörg Haider' s rise to power, with the inauguration of a conservative right-wing and FPÖ coalition government, is a sign of the terrible revival in Europe of a monster to which liberalism has given birth. The success of the Austrian Freedom Party owes as much to the endorsement of respectability provided by the Austrian right wing and social democrats as to the policy of the latter, whose social disasters paved the way for extreme right-wing populism. The resolution stipulates possible diplomatic means to isolate the new government politically without even mentioning the root causes of the resurgence of Fascism. It can be explained by the feeling of helplessness of the people who are the victims of the ideology of mighty Mammon and by the choice of the ruling classes to promote strong government in order to take their policies of austerity and deregulation ever further. In order to oppose the xenophobic statements of an apprentice dictator who is nostalgic for the Third Reich, we must take every opportunity we can to express our solidarity with the Austrians opposed to Fascism. This is why we are voting in favour of this resolution in spite of its hypocritical references to a 'European democratic model' which bears more resemblance to a fortress which tracks downs, expels and imprisons immigrants without the proper papers, when it is not opening files on teenagers. - (DE) I have just voted against the motion for a resolution on the situation in Austria in view of a possible government being formed between the ÖVP and the FPÖ. I consider the casting of Jörg Haider as ""Europe's scapegoat"" (or even worse, neo-Nazi and Super Racist) to be counterproductive. Of course I, in no way, agree with the publicised statements of this right-wing populist and fully condemn xenophobia and any downplaying of the Hitler regime. However, I fear that a purely emotional reaction by Europe to the events in Austria will only multiply Haider's adherents."	de
But when corpus juris was actually launched in 1977 in San Sebastian - to a very select audience of 140 jurists, with no media invited - the President of the European Parliament at the time, Mr Gil-Robles Gil-Delgado, said that he considered it embryonic and that the intention was to extend EU competence in criminal matters to all areas of criminal activity. We need a public debate on this. We need the Member States and the citizens in the Member States to be properly informed. The issue of the threat to the traditional legal system in Ireland and the UK needs to be addressed. There needs to be much more openness and transparency on this issue than there has been to date. It is unacceptable that something like this has been foisted on the Member States of the EU without any proper public debate. Mr President, on behalf of the Italian Radical Members, I abstained on this text in the Committee on Budgetary Control, because I share the concerns that have been voiced, in such an authoritative way, by the representative of another legal culture which is certainly important: common law. With this text we are undoubtedly forcing the issue, since we believe that there are points that must be resolved and it is important for Community fraud to be curbed, to be crushed. Nevertheless, the way in which our committee intends to see this text through, with the drive and stubborn desire of its Chair, Mrs Theato, will not be without its critics. Another major criticism of the text concerns secondary law. Article 280 of the Treaty allows the Council to pinpoint the appropriate instruments to curb fraud. Nevertheless, we are left feeling slightly perplexed that they envisage an institution which will mean higher quality, without immediately planning how to deal with the repercussions of this. That is to say, they are neglecting the area of defence and therefore the possibility for the prosecution and the defence to work together effectively within such an important legal system. We wanted to express our perplexity as regards these points by abstaining in committee. Mr President, we need to speak our minds on this subject in the European Parliament, during the plenary sittings and in the committees, even if it is obvious that the debate must take into account the world of the culture, the legal culture and the places where institutional issues are addressed. We find ourselves dealing with some very serious events, which in the past seemed to be the norm. Today, something has changed, at least in terms of mechanisms, and especially as regards monitoring, but we are still not satisfied, particularly if debates are held in competent fora that go as far as to discuss a European Public Prosecutor, crimes, fraud, the misappropriation of funds and the disclosure of confidential information pertaining to one' s office at European level. I feel that we must clearly safeguard the Community' s interests, its image and its relationship with taxpayers, who are an indispensable and essential part of Community life. For this reason, it is right to look at the issue of safeguarding common interests, and to establish better links with legal systems within the individual States.	es
The debate about either extending the Lomé Convention with its quotas and protectionism, or, instead, gradually winding down the special relationship between the European Union and the ACP countries in the name of free trade, is a warped debate between two ways of perpetuating the pillage and impoverishment of those countries. I protest against an ignoble and inhuman organisation which literally condemns hundreds of millions of human beings to a wretched death to enrich a minority. A mere fraction of the fantastic wealth accumulated by the big groups could lift these poor countries out of extreme poverty, but, until we have the courage to take on those big capitalist groups, we are just covering up the real problems. Mr President, I want to thank the Co-President of the Joint ACP-EU Assembly, Mr Corrie. It was no easy task to draw up a report on a complicated forum like the ACP-EU Assembly. In this speech, I will confine myself to addressing certain points I consider fundamental. I believe the European Parliament should call for the Assembly to become truly parliamentary, urging all ACP countries to send members of their national parliaments as their representatives, so as to strengthen their own democratic fabric. My next contribution to the debate is to turn my attention to globalisation and the WTO, which is seen by the ACP countries as an enormous danger to their development. I do believe the ACP countries need a transition period, but they also need support in the context of the new logic of regionalisation of aid, not only in agriculture and fisheries, but also in the exploitation of mineral and underground resources, some of which are being exploited, with slim economic returns to the ACP countries themselves. Thirdly, the European Parliament - through a joint working group within the Joint Assembly - must make a major effort to achieve stability in ACP countries' budgets through the selection of budgetary items to permit economic and, above all, social development, and by monitoring income and fiscal policies in force in the ACP countries. We must put the people of the ACP countries first in our relationship with their rulers, who need to be fully aware that development aid from the European Union is intended for the people and not for the oligarchies that handle all the internal and external resources in some countries. Fourthly, and finally, the prevention of inter-ethnic conflicts between States must be our constant concern and to some extent this can be achieved either through a strong and authoritative diplomatic offensive or with the proposals I have set out. Mr President, I agree with the positive evaluation Mrs Junker has just made and I want to add that Mr Corrie has started his term as Co-President of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly with effective and impartial work deserving of our full appreciation. I shall restrict my speech to one particular act which took place a few days ago, partly as a consequence of events alluded to in the report we are debating here.	es
Words in politics can be incendiary, can be inflammatory, or can be conciliatory. We found that Mr Jörg Haider, as a wordsmith, has been a voice for racism and for xenophobia. He is a man who plays on fear and who has exploited vulnerability. That is why this debate is important - to put down a marker that when you mainstream extremism, something profound is happening in Europe today. (Applause) I hasten to add that our quarrel is not with the Austrian people. We respect the rights of the Austrian people to their own democratic process. We defend the rights and constitutional prerogatives of the Austrian people, but we here in the European Parliament have the duty to recall our fundamental values as set out in Article 6 of the Treaty - the values of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights. Every right-thinking person in this House believes that these are universal and indivisible without regard to colour, class or creed. We must promote and defend those rights, all the while saying to the people of Austria: our quarrel is not with you. I wish to say with regard to the initiative of the Portuguese Presidency that we support the spirit and the political intention behind it. It may not be an ideal initiative in terms of its structure but we accept Mr President-in-Office, that it is rooted in idealism and for that reason we are inclined to support it. I share with President Prodi a preference for the Community method and we must look at Article 6 and Article 7 of the Treaty. Article 7 talks about the possibility of suspension in the event of serious or persistent breaches of our fundamental values. We must find a way as institutions to benchmark and give meaning to this so that it has a reality and a substance. Then we can work together by the Community method to root out this cancer within our midst. I want to say Madame President some words to Mr Schüssel. Mr Schüssel is a man with an honourable record in European politics. He now intends to ride into government on the back of a political tiger. Mr Schüssel - you are assuming a very serious, personal, national and European responsibility. That responsibility, which you Mr Schüssel now take on, is to respect the letter and the spirit of the European Treaties. Finally, Madame President, this is a debate which touches on the heart of our democratic values and institutions and calls to mind that the price of liberty is eternal vigilance. On this continent, of all places, with the experience of hateful racism that we have suffered from in the past and at such great cost, we have to insist that today' s debate is not about interference with the sovereign rights of a State. It is a dogged insistence by the democratically elected part of the institutions of this Union that we will not as Europeans countenance turning the clock back. (Loud applause)	es
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, please excuse my late arrival, but this other political issue is still on the agenda today, more is the pity. The Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy would advise you to release the EUR 35 million, and this piece of advice is given because this money can truly benefit those in need. The things that have given us cause for criticism are not so serious as to stop us wanting to help the people there. However, this does not mean that we will forget the criticism in the process. Of course we would be a lot further on in our procedure if the Council administration had not forgotten to inform the European Parliament in good time and to provide it with official documents. Only then would we have been able to conduct proper and searching discussions. I urge the administration to see to it that this does not happen in future. It is only because there are people in need that we are prepared to overlook this. However, we must be sure to introduce certain conditions here. One condition is that money should be given to those who will make sensible use of it and not to those who might use it for pursuing other aims. In other words, we should ensure that the money falls to Mr Kouchner' s sphere of competence and not to other spheres. Secondly, even if the Commission and the Council adopt a different position on this because they see real problems there, we believe that the other donors must also fulfil the obligations they have entered into. This mission is being conducted under the auspices of the United Nations and we cannot have a situation where the European Union is the only one to fulfil its obligations. It is no less incumbent on the other donor countries to fulfil their obligations within this timeframe, in the interests of the persons affected. This brings me onto the point that in future we are going to have to concern ourselves much more intensively with this issue in general terms, that is to say, not just with this specific project but with overall developments in south-east Europe, and with the aid delivered there. This is another example of the fact that the European Union is prepared to help and to give money but the political leadership lacks coherence. We have so many coordinators, who, in turn, are responsible to so many employers, that we will soon have to employ a coordinator for the coordinators. Perhaps it would be better, however, if the positions of responsibility within the European Union and the other institutions from the OSCE to the United Nations, were to get together some time to introduce a uniform, coordinated procedure and to examine how we can be of real assistance to the people there. I know that the Commission is thinking seriously about how to achieve this, but if the European Union is doing the most work out there, then it should also be given the leadership, and bring coherence to the situation, so that we can be of real assistance to the people. It makes no sense at all for the various international institutions and associations to be engaged in competition amongst themselves rather than investing all their energies in helping the people on the ground! Bearing in mind that the conference of donors for the stability pact is constantly being postponed - it is now set for the end of March - that no one knows which projects are actually in the pipeline, that one cannot tell how things can actually be implemented, and there is a steady stream of new press conferences, this does not appear to be the way to restore peace and reconciliation amongst peoples to this region of Europe!	de
A common fisheries policy must coordinate as well as possible the requirements for conservation of species and resource management with economic and market requirements. To this end, more extensive, compatible, uniform data is required, and we expect this to provide us with more general information on the Union' s fishing industry if properly collected and interpreted. However, we also expect there to be greater awareness and appreciation of the peculiarities, differences, varying situations and traditions of the fishing industries, and that they will not be disregarded, penalised or even eliminated due to the misinterpretation of the concept of harmonisation of fisheries policies, as has sometimes occurred in the past. A case in point is the Mediterranean, including my country' s fishing industry. After years of the CFP for the Mediterranean restricting itself to trade regulations and company aid, Regulation 1626 at last introduced a responsible fisheries policy, with measures protecting vulnerable fishery resources in order to ensure sustainable exploitation. This is a worthy objective, the implementation of which, however, has sometimes revealed an ignorance of the biological characteristics of Mediterranean species of fish. A subsequent regulation, Regulation 1448, adopted, not by chance, in 1999, permitted certain exemptions, in particular for special cases. The time period will elapse on 31 May next, to be precise, when the Commission will present a proposal. We hope that the presentation of the proposal will take into account the fact that this fishing system is vitally important for the economy of huge Italian coastal areas and that the scientific data hitherto collected demonstrate that, from the point of view of biological implications, resources are, to some extent, sustainable. Thank you very much, Commissioner Fischler. The debate is closed. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m. Combating certain fish diseases The next item is the report A5-0036/2000 by Mr Hudghton, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, on the proposal for a Council directive amending Directive 93/53/EEC introducing minimum Community measures for the control of certain fish diseases (COM(1999) - C5-0168/1999 - 1999/0191 (CNS)). Infectious salmon anaemia is a contagious viral disease which was first recorded in Norway in 1984, then in Canada in 1986 and first found in European Union territory in May 1998 in Scotland. Although the virus has been found in other species, the disease itself is so far confined to salmon. The virus is known not to survive above 25o Celsius and scientists have therefore agreed that no threat to human health exists; it simply cannot survive in warm-blooded creatures. The Scottish salmon-farming industry is the biggest in the EU, spread throughout some of Europe' s most peripheral communities. It sustains some 6 500 jobs and generates around EUR 800 million annually. It is obvious therefore that this issue is especially important to Scotland but it is vitally important to all parts of Europe that the disease be brought under control and, if possible, eradicated. The current directive prohibits the use of vaccination and requires that all fish in an affected farm be slaughtered whether affected by the disease or not.	de
On ratifying the Amsterdam Treaty, all Member States stated that they wanted to accord combating fraud against the financial interests of the European Union the same priority as combating fraud to their own detriment. Yet as things stand, only the first four Member States have ratified the agreement concluded in 1995. The Commission wholeheartedly agrees with the rapporteur that this is an unacceptable situation A legislative act, a directive, in which there is a standardised definition for the different types of fraud such as money-laundering or corruptibility, and in which the obligation to launch criminal proceedings is enshrined as a binding objective, may enable us to take a major step forwards, and I will therefore advise the Commission to examine this step with all due haste. OLAF, the European anti-fraud office is one of the most important instruments the Commission has for fulfilling its obligation to combat fraud. Accordingly, the Commission refused to put up with the fact that both European banks, the ECB and the EIB, contested the right of OLAF to include these two institutions in its investigations, citing their independent status. This is why the Commission resolved on raising a complaint against these two banks at its last meeting, and I hope that Parliament approves this step. The second recommendation in this report relates to assessing the legitimacy of the investigative measures undertaken by OLAF in the various European institutions. It is the task of the monitoring committee for OLAF, which was set up at the same time as OLAF, to safeguard the independence of OLAF, however it cannot undertake the action mentioned in the report of monitoring internal investigative activities conducted by OLAF. I am fully in agreement with the monitoring committee and the rapporteur on this point. In other words, there is a loophole here which must be filled and I will examine the solution advocated in the report in the interests of moving things on. There is one thing I would ask though: I believe we must prevent the debate on extending the legal basis for OLAF from leading to the misconception that OLAF does not now have enough authority. No, there must be no undermining of OLAF' s authority, and neither do I think this was the rapporteur' s intention. As such, I would ask you to give OLAF' s work your full support, also in its present form. Thank you, Commissioner Schreyer. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m. VOTE (Parliament approved the Commission proposal) Heaton-Harris (PPE-DE). Mr President, on a point of order I should like to ask you for clarification of the Rules of Procedure: namely Rules 133(2) and 138(4). These are both about voting. Is it not the case that on votes other than roll-call votes, the vote should take place initially by show of hands and only then, if there is some doubt, should we utilise the electronic voting system? That is quite right, Mr Heaton-Harris. I put the matter to a vote by a show of hands because none of the groups had requested voting by roll call. You know that voting by roll call or electronic checking only takes place if Members of the House request it. In this particular case, I can assure you there was a large majority in favour of the directive which we have just voted on. Mr President, I was not referring to that particular vote but to votes in general.	de
Joint resolution on Austria Madam President, the Union for a Europe of Nations Group did not associate itself with the joint PPE/DE-PSE resolution on the political situation in Austria following the formation in that country of a coalition government between the conservatives and Jörg Haider' s Freedom Party. This PPE/DE-PSE resolution commends the initiative taken by fourteen Member States to apply pressure to Austria by organising a sort of diplomatic boycott. What we find most shocking is the fact that this joint intervention claims the authority of the Treaty, as if this stated somewhere that henceforth the free and democratic expression of a people could be cancelled by the will of the heads of government of neighbouring countries who in fact, in this instance, have carefully refrained from consulting their own peoples. Whatever Jörg Haider' s verbal excesses, which we of course deplore, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect this. In our opinion, it is clear that the left wing in the European Parliament, in association with the Austrian left wing which was defeated in the electoral arena, have mounted a petty political campaign resorting to the memory of a sinister but fortunately bygone period. Although comparing Haider to Hitler is a concept without any credibility whatsoever, it has nonetheless partly achieved its purpose in unsettling some PPE/DE Members of Parliament. But, going beyond this petty political operation, what the majority in the European Parliament is afraid of most of all is that the threat to the left-right cohabitation in Austria, which caused political life to stagnate and rot, may soon spread to the European system of co-management which is producing equally appalling results. In order to prevent this threat to the system, it is ready to do anything, including overruling the outcome of free elections, including setting up a thought police, including establishing a new form of totalitarianism. Madam President, on behalf of the Members of Parliament who represent the Front national, the Vlaams Blok and the Movimento sociale italiano, I should like to ask the question: in this outrageous interference in internal Austrian affairs which the European Union has undertaken in contravention of general international law, in contravention of the Treaties, in contravention of morality, who is pulling the strings? Is this hysteria spontaneous? Is it the product of mere foolishness or, more probably, of a deliberate strategy, which is the same throughout the world? Who is imposing their will on the nations of Europe, daring to stop them choosing their own fate? Underground networks? The government of the United States, or of Israel? Or their Socialist back-up troops who, in this House, have the cheek to thrust their values down our throats? What, then, are the values of these Socialists who feathered their electoral nest in the last century by painting the idea of greater social justice in glowing colours for the benefit of the underprivileged, and who today are nothing more than the party of protected civil servants, full-time union officials and state capitalism? What are the values of the Belgian Socialist Party, which only goes from paedophilia scandals to corruption scandals, via Vandam and Agusta? What are the values of the French Socialist Party, which extorted money from all the town councils under its thumb in the Urba, Sages and Graco scandals?	it
I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning. It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time. We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation. However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that. In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response. Many thanks for this. This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best. The damage suffered, also in ecological terms, cannot be expressed in money. Hence also this joint debate involving transport and environmental management Members. During the Christmas break, when the Dutch media received attention for the Erika disaster, I had a look, just out of interest, on the Internet to see what arrangements were, in fact, already in place for the purpose of taking relevant measures, especially after Premier Jospin had said that Europe should do more. What I learned is that, actually, there is sufficient legislation in place but the problem is the lack of supervision. Could I highlight a few points which have also been touched upon by the Commissioner? First of all, the port-state control, according to which 25% of all ships require inspection. I think that this 25% should not only be enforced but that it should also be ensured that more inspections take place. So this 25% should be increased. Furthermore, if a ship is no longer seaworthy, not only should the facts be examined, but a legal system should be introduced which states or recommends that the vessel should no longer be used. But this is not in place. Mr President, I would welcome some action in this area. Finally, as far as the technical requirements for ships are concerned, some Members have already mentioned just now that, since 1999 in the United States, ships should in any case be double-hulled.	es
Is that the message we want to send out? There is one other specific point which is dear to me: Member States should be able, if they so wish, to set up trans-national water transfers. This type of project complies with the principle of regional cohesion and solidarity, which we have always defended, and, as such, should enjoy the widespread support of the European Union in the context of the promotion of trans-European networks and regional policy (through the Structural Funds). I would like to remind the House that we adopted an own initiative report on the technical feasibility of trans-European water networks two years ago and I would be most obliged if the European Commission could shortly tell Parliament what action it has taken on that report. . (ES) We have seen a report concerned with water quality in Europe transformed into an instrument of commercial war. We all agree that ensuring water quality is a hugely important objective, above all, given the adverse effects of developing a model of accelerated industrial growth on the natural environment. It is clear that this model' s logic of private profit has been harmful, and therefore the 'polluter pays' principle is a suitable way of dealing with these consequences. However, apart from these principles, there is the consideration that water, as a common resource, cannot be subjected to the rules of the market. Surprisingly, I imagine with the best of intentions, this ecological objective has become an instrument of commercial war by making consumers, and especially the agricultural sector, responsible for the price of installations and the procedures for ensuring water quality. In fact, water becomes simply one more product subject to the laws of the market. This means that the neoliberal model now reigns in the field of water. By failing to distinguish countries and regions where water is abundant, and is therefore not a problem, from regions where drought and low rainfall make it a scarce commodity, stifling the chances of any economic and social development, we are perverting the ecological principle and turning it into a weapon. In the same way it is somewhat ironic that we are hindering the possibility of sharing this commodity, which is scarce in some areas, while regions where there is abundant water are giving advice on austerity with regard to its use, to those who live in drought areas. As a result of this lack of sensitivity and solidarity, my vote has been consistent with what I have said, as an MEP from one of the dry Mediterranean agricultural regions - although one with prospects - namely, the Region of Murcia. . On behalf of the European Parliament Labour Party, I wish to indicate that while we have supported the major part of the Lienemann report, we have certain reservations. The timetable set in the report of 2020 is unrealistic and impracticable, but the timetable set by the Council of 2034 is too far in the distance. We believe therefore that conciliation will set a more realistic date.	fr
Mr President, Commissioner, the proposed directive on end-of-life vehicles before us today aims firstly to guarantee a high level of environmental protection in the Union, but also to safeguard the proper operation of the internal market in this sector. Let me briefly say that historic and vintage vehicles must, of course, be exempt from the scope of this directive. Cars are also part of our cultural heritage. I think we would all agree on that. Having said that, one of the stumbling blocks concerns Article 12, i.e. the date on which the directive will come into force. Parliament' s proposed solution of 18 months following the directive' s entry into force, for new vehicles, is not terribly realistic. The European car population amounts to several tens of millions of cars which will have to be recovered even though they were not designed for recycling. The common position was more feasible since it envisaged 2006 for vehicles already on the road. This would, furthermore, make it possible to allow firms time to make funds available to meet these additional expenses. Like my group, I shall therefore support this aspect the common position which, I feel, offers a balanced compromise between constraints upon firms and essential advances in environmental protection. Mr President, the European Parliament is today facing an important decision. Will we give our backing to forward-looking environmental and consumer protection or, as the amendments of Florenz, Lange and others cause me to fear, will we allow ourselves to become a servant of the German car industry? The credibility of Parliament as a champion of environmental protection is at stake. It would be shameful to say the least if the European Parliament were to draw back from the professions the governments of the 14 Member States and the European Commission have been making concerning manufacturer responsibility and environmental protection! The intention of Florenz and Lange in their amendments is obvious: to sabotage the directive! The proposed shared responsibility would undermine the polluter pays principle and detract from product innovation. In setting up numerous hurdles their sole aim is to hamper an efficient ecological material flow policy and by going down the road of type approvals they seek to delay the implementation of the directives by 12 years or more. This is totally unacceptable. I therefore appeal to the German delegates in particular to prevent major political damage occurring today! The red-green federal government has not exactly covered itself with glory in the debate on the End-of-life Vehicles Directive. Do not continue in this vein! The whinging about competitive disadvantages is laughable if it only concerns competitive disadvantages sustained by the German car industry. Start representing your people and not just your car manufacturers! Vote in favour of environmental and consumer protection and for innovation in the car and recycling industry! Mr President, this directive has been under discussion since 1997. It is high time that we reached an agreement. Since I more or less share the views of my colleague, Mr Sjöstedt and the representative of the Greens, Mr de Roo, I am not going to use the two minutes allotted to me, and I will highlight just two issues.	it
Mr President, I need not repeat what the rapporteur said or the points Mr Coelho made. All that is indeed very true and correct. It is easy to counterfeit the euro. We are going through a dangerous transitional phase in which a phenomenon has appeared in criminal law that is perhaps unique in monetary history. It is that a currency that does not even exist yet, that is not in circulation, but exists only as bank deposit money, can nevertheless be counterfeited already. Yet because that currency is not yet in circulation as such, counterfeiting euros does not at present constitute a criminal offence. It is a highly complex problem. If we do not act promptly - as Mrs Cederschiöld rightly said - anyone can produce a few counterfeit euros now and possibly not be prosecuted for subsequently putting them into circulation. Let me say in passing that this may seem an attractive prospect for a number of people. So what is the European Union doing about it? It is doing a number of things that are right, as Mrs Cederschiöld has described; but, in the context of these things she described, Parliament must look not so much at the content of the framework decision, not so much at the report drawn up by Mrs Cederschiöld, but more at the procedures that are being applied. The manner in which the Council, which is by far the most undemocratic institution in Europe, consulted the European Parliament makes a mockery of the concept of democracy. We received a text for consultation which the Council had been working on for a very long time, incidentally with only partial success - I will come to that in a moment. Now the European Parliament is supposed to state its position on this complex, difficult and, at times, contradictory Council document in the space of three months. It is only thanks to the immense efforts of Mrs Cederschiöld and to Parliament' s decision not to stand by its democratic right to conduct its advisory procedure over an adequate period of time and to have all the documents available in all the languages, that we have now managed to give our position by the date set by the Council, so that the decision scheduled for March can indeed be taken. On a subject as important as counterfeiting and protection against counterfeiting and harmonising the necessary criminal law provisions we cannot really work at the ridiculous pace the Council is demanding of us. So let me state quite clearly here, on behalf of my group, that we discussed at length with Mrs Cederschiöld whether it is reasonable to work like this. We concluded that it is not, but given the importance of the issue we nonetheless agreed to accept this procedure. This framework decision does without any doubt represent some progress. Only, as Mrs Cederschiöld pointed out, in the end it does not fully achieve the legal certainty the Council wanted because various shortcomings have not been dealt with. They relate to the minimum rules we are seeking to establish, the minimum rules relating to a punishable offence and in particular the application of the same criminal law norms in all Member States, including those that have not yet introduced the euro but where it could theoretically be counterfeited.	fr
I can only emphasise that these are the really hard nuts that finally need to be cracked. Mr President, firstly I would like to extend my heartfelt congratulations to my colleague, Mr van Hulten. It is a good feeling to be able to say that he is from our delegation and I am, I think, entitled to feel a little proud of him. I would in any case like to congratulate him on his report. Mr President, the Commission' s resignation has also created a culture of fear amongst many officials within the hierarchy and large bureaucracy. The call to make a cultural U-turn and embrace a culture of responsibility seems to me a very fundamental one. I have witnessed from close up within the Development Committee how thousands of projects stagnate and how sometimes up to 80% of the money is not spent. Sometimes, an enormous reservoir of money is created, not because it is not desperately needed, not because there are no sound proposals, but because the whole system has collapsed. A lack of responsibility, too much ex ante, not enough ex post and, as a result, far too little in the way of a culture of real effective spending. It would be marvellous if this report were to give the green light to result-oriented spending of this kind, with all the work organised on that basis. When the Commission' s first draft report soon becomes the official report on 1 March, I very much hope that our input here will help ensure that we will actually witness this change. Without any doubt, this will then be a service, Mr President, to the European public and, by means of the results we produce, we will also regain and re-acquire something which we have ostensibly lost over the past couple of years. This is the best support we can give to European democracy. If, in this way, we can move away from the culture of the fifties and cross over into the next century, we are witnessing a very special moment indeed. Mr President, first of all, congratulations to Michiel van Hulten for his first report. It was a baptism of fire but we have a saying in the Netherlands appropriate for this occasion: in at the deep end and you will swim in no time. Mr van Hulten, I think you deserve a medal for your efforts. There are two points which, in my opinion, deserve special attention on the part of the ELDR. Firstly, there is the Commissioners' individual responsibility. This must be regulated during the IGC. However, we should not like this important issue to end up entirely in the hands of the Council and we have, therefore, submitted an amendment in which we ask whether an interinstitutional agreement could be reached between the Commission and Parliament in order to ensure that we have a kind of fall-back position and are not placing our fate completely in the hands of the Council. Secondly, as already mentioned by my colleague, Mr Mulder, the ELDR is of the opinion that the European Parliament should also be investigated by independent experts. This will contribute hugely towards re-establishing the confidence of the European citizens in this institution. We at the European Parliament cannot be a credible counterpart to this reformed Commission as long as we do not search our hearts and put our own House in order as well.	es
This legal framework is fleshed out in the priorities set by the accession partnerships that were adopted by the Commission and the Council last year and are now being implemented in the corresponding programmes and project management. On the contrary, I would say that, although many areas of European policy leave something to be desired in terms of coherence, in this instance I would claim, on behalf of the Commission and the Council, that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy. . (DE) Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, now that the Commissioner has explained to us, in an extremely coherent manner, that the erstwhile President-in-Office of the Council and his Minister of State for Europe bore responsibility for the lack of coherence, perhaps you could help the Commissioner and ourselves, so as to enable us to take this decision. It would be helpful if you could give a positive answer to my questions on the Financial Perspective up until 2004 and on heading B7, or if you could at least confirm that the Portuguese Council Presidency intends to make efforts of this kind to make good the aforementioned lack of coherence, which is something the Commissioner will also seek to achieve on the part of the Commission. . (PT) Mr President, I am sure that the issue raised by my friend Elmar Brok will be considered by the Council. I feel that the criticism made of the previous presidency is not appropriate. I believe that the work done by the previous presidency in defining the financial outlook was excellent, regardless of who was involved in that work. In any case, the question that this raises is an important one and the Council will not fail to support the proposals that the Commission has presented in this respect. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, as I understood it, Mr Brok was actually referring to an earlier presidency still. Mr President, I asked Commissioner Verheugen a specific question about the financing instrument MEDA but he has not provided an answer. I would urge him to do so for his answer will determine the way in which we decide to vote on the various proposed amendments we have before us. Forgive me Mr Poos. There was a lack of clarity at precisely the point at which you put the question to me. This is how matters stand with regard to MEDA: Malta and Cyprus can take part in the national programmes, but not in the country-specific ones, because the incomes are too high. Thank you very much Commissioner Verheugen. The debate is closed. The vote will take place on Thursday. Question Time (Council) Question No 1 by (H-0022/00): Subject: Controlling access to Community waters for oil tankers In connection with the accident involving the oil tanker ERIKA off the French coast, which produced a large oil slick, what steps does the Council intend to take to control access to Community waters for tankers flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, on 24 January the Council considered the consequences of the accident the previous month involving the oil tanker Erika.	fr
The European Commission' s sixth report presents very valuable conclusions. I shall summarise two of those highlighted by the rapporteur, one positive and one negative. The first is that important advances have been made in regional and social cohesion throughout the Union and that the Community Funds have been a major, although not decisive, factor in reducing regional inequalities. The negative conclusion is that the great effort made has been more efficient in harmonising the European regions' GDP and productivity than in harmonising its levels of unemployment. It is therefore necessary to link structural financing more closely to job creation. This, Commissioner, is the first commandment for the coming period. Thus, Mr President, I ask my fellow Members to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as other speakers have done, to take good note of the conclusions of their sixth periodic report when they address the programming for the period 2000-2006.   Mr President, Commissioner, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and for having taken due account of the proposed amendments while the committee was debating it. The sixth periodical report gives a basis for assessing the implementation of the Union' s regional policy aims. The report shows that growth has been uneven, despite all our efforts. Very rapid growth is continuing in Central Europe. The strongest regional centres also continue to grow faster than the general European average, whereas many southern European and northern areas are developing considerably more slowly. We now require an in-depth analysis of why regional policy is not producing the desired result in all areas. Is the reason bureaucracy or is it because insufficient notice has been taken of interregional differences, long distances, climates that are too cold or too hot, sparse populations and austere conditions? How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development in a way that the less developed areas can remain a part of that development? It is also important to discover what the effects of Union enlargement will be on Structural Funds and the development of the Union' s more remote areas. The Member States must also bear in mind their responsibility. Some Member States have been in breach of the principle of subsidiarity and cut national regional funds when regional aid coming via the Union has been increased. This has chipped away at the results that regional policy has produced. In the future, we must also develop indicators so that measures can be targeted at the right time at the right place. For example, uncontrolled migration has not been given sufficient consideration. In this connection, too, weight has to be given to the decisive importance of SMEs as employers and forces behind regional development. It is absolutely essential that companies in areas developing more slowly adopt the latest technology and know-how. Our Group is in favour of adopting this report. Mr President, Commissioner, the European Union' s regional policy has, until now, not been able to interpret, in any significant way, the existing differences in our inhabitants' incomes.	de
"We were therefore also very satisfied with the decisions which were taken on this issue at the Helsinki Summit in December. An unduly ambitious extension to the agenda at the present time would risk delaying the enlargement process. That is something we do not want to see, and we have therefore voted against any such extension. We nonetheless very much agree with our colleagues that there is a need for transparency in connection with the Intergovernmental Conference so that people are clear as to how the work is proceeding. . (SV) We are pleased that a limited agenda has been established for the Intergovernmental Conference at the Helsinki Conference. Possible future Member States ought to be involved in, and have an influence upon, the shaping of the EU of the future. The elections to the European Parliament in 1999 showed perfectly clearly that the people of Europe do not fall in with the notion of an ever more federalist EU centred upon Brussels. With the convening of the forthcoming IGC, the process of European Union is topical once again. Once again the discussion is going to be monopolised by the Heads of State and Government. In other words, fifteen people are going to have discussions and decide, behind closed doors, on the fate of more than 350 million individuals. It is therefore easy to understand the public' s lack of interest, given the construction of Europe which is going on behind their back and in areas which are not really of concern to them. In fact, one only need look at the agenda of the IGC: the institutions, enlargement and European defence. The fact is that the prime concerns are the strengthening of executive power, the development of closer relations with liberalism in the countries of Eastern Europe and the relaunch of the militarisation of Europe, particularly by increasing military budgets. Social Europe, used as a foil by the EU, has simply been eliminated from the agenda. All this does is to legitimise the development, on the European scale, of resistance movements anxious to bring in a social charter which would harmonise workers' main claims towards the highest common denominator. This is why I am voting against the report. I voted for the resolution to adopt an opinion is in favour of convening the IGC. I did so because it sums up the philosophy of the Portuguese Presidency, which is supported by a broad majority in Parliament, of opening up the IGC agenda beyond issues strictly related to redressing the balance of power between Member States, large and small, as was originally stated when the Helsinki Council was convened. Unfortunately, in the issues covered by the resolutions on future subjects for revisions to the Treaty on European Union, nothing has so far been stated about the need to review Article 7, which deals with suspending a State in the event of a serious and persistent violation of the ""founding"" principles of the Union, as laid down in Article 6. As the present crisis involving Austria has demonstrated, the Union has the right to protect itself. Nevertheless, the legal mechanisms that exist in the Treaty are weak, difficult to apply politically and legally, do not define the powers of the institutions and do not guarantee fair legal treatment for processes of major importance. Suspending a state is just such a process, and is to be condemned."	fr
Mr Crowley, with regard to the presidency' s scope for supporting actions by non-governmental organisations, particularly those which attempt to resolve the problems faced by the homeless, I would like to say that such initiatives are welcome, and we are very much open to the possibility of supporting them. We have worked closely with Portuguese NGOs and with some initiatives they have proposed within the framework of the Portuguese Presidency, which we are combining with the wide range of concerns underpinning our whole programme. We have no specific, concrete initiatives in this area but that does not mean that we are closed to the idea that an initiative proposed to us by NGOs in this area might be considered during our presidency. It should be pointed out that this can only be done within the Council' s scope for action. Any aspect of this which may impinge on the Commission' s right of initiative will obviously have to be done through the Commission itself. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, you have talked a lot about the future, about what the Commission will do, and what the Presidency will do in Lisbon, etc. However, you also said something which I find particularly frightening. You said that in Lisbon you intend to discuss more dynamic and competitive development. I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion. I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers. What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth? I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters. You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited. I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative. I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion. One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion. The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed. It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence. It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters.	es
That is the entire programme for the next five years on the question of internal security, freedom, citizens' rights and judicial cooperation. A paper this short is a farce. A farce because we know and appreciate the work of Commissioner Vitorino and what we have here on paper is a blatant contradiction to how things actually stand. A paper such as this is no basis for a scoreboard. It has been extolled and celebrated as a huge achievement and I am all for it; we need a basis for a scoreboard. We here in Parliament want to hold a serious discussion about the future development in this policy area on the basis of a programme. What we are looking for are minimum standards in asylum procedures so that refugees can be given help quickly, and those who are not fleeing know where they stand. We want instruments to prevent abuse. We want to develop a Community immigration policy which takes account of the Member States' capacity to absorb immigrants and we need to extend the operational powers of EUROPOL, for example, so that specific steps can be taken to combat organised crime. We debate these issues intensively and seriously and we should be entitled to expect likewise from the Commission, even where it is merely submitting a paper. Madam President, I would also like to welcome the Commission' s initiative of presenting us with a report on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends, in subsequent documents, to avoid the excess of generalisations and the vagueness of the text which we are examining today. Having said this, Madam President, I am prepared, once again, to be a voice crying in the wilderness as a result of the absence of a fishing policy. It is really surprising that the Commission does not treat the revision of one of its common policies as a strategic objective for the coming years, in view of the reform which must take place in 2002. There is no doubt whatsoever that this revision process will be the most important thing to affect the fishing industry for many years. However, it seems that the Commission does not share this view, although it is the Commission which is obliged to present the Council and Parliament with a report on the functioning of the common fisheries policy over the last decade before the end of 2001, and it is on this basis that the Council will have to make the appropriate decisions with regard to its modification. In fact, the revision process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which in 1998 already issued and adopted a report pointing out all the current problems and deficiencies of the common fisheries policy. We have often asked for a basic timetable for this revision and we have received no reply. Less than two years is not much time if we bear in mind also that the fishing policy is anomalous with regard to the internal market regulations and that such anomalies should be resolved within the framework of this reform process.	it
Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, I should like firstly to thank Mr Procacci for his report. However, I should also like to extend thanks to the various committees involved and Parliament as a whole for the broad support which they have given the LEADER+ initiative. This initiative should give the countryside new impetus to develop and test new and original ideas, ideas which it is then intended should at a later stage be incorporated in the general programmes as models. I am also pleased that Parliament essentially supports the Commission' s view that LEADER+ should be applied in all rural areas, that overriding priorities should be introduced and that, above all, active cooperation and networking between rural areas should be encouraged. In addition, I note that Parliament shares the Commission' s view that the preferred form for implementing LEADER+ is the use of global grants. Turning now to some of the individual questions raised here today, I can also confirm that we wish to have the widest possible partnership and participation in LEADER+. The various groups, be they environmental organisations or groups concerned with employment, have the possibility of taking part in drafting the Commission directives. And there will not be less funds available than in the current period either; there will be more. I should also like to remind you that the idea of setting up an observatory is nothing new. There was also an observatory under LEADER I and LEADER II. It has one purpose only and that is precisely to maintain active networking between the individual LEADER groups. The cost of this observatory is not permitted to exceed 2% of the LEADER budget. As far as the possibility of having projects containing training initiatives is concerned, I might point out that this is precisely a point which we have now integrated into the new rural development policy, which means, in our view, that it is no longer necessary to do this as part of LEADER. I now come to the content of the report. In point 14, Parliament calls on the Commission to submit an evaluation report on LEADER II immediately. I should simply like to point out that this does not make very much sense at the present time because, as you know, it is still possible - and in fact will be until the end of 2001 - for LEADER II funds to be disbursed. We therefore think that it would be more sensible to wait until the programme' s conclusion before carrying out the evaluation. We will obviously do this and will also forward a report to you on it. In point 18, Parliament suggests publishing a compendium of examples of successful initiatives. In response I can only say that this already exists. It has already been compiled by the Commission and I can make a copy available to any Member of this House who is interested. In point 21, Parliament stresses that the guidelines in LEADER+ now need to be adopted quickly so that the programmes can start.	es
We find you faithful to the principles which have always guided you, which have always guided your actions; your attachment to fundamental values. You reminded us of your speech in 1994, which you yourself qualify as slightly provocative, but there is such a thing as creative utopia and we have been able to gauge together how far we have come. And you very opportunely highlighted the role of the civil society, the importance of the civil society, not just in the candidate countries, but in all the countries in the European Union, in restoring our citizens' confidence, in restoring confidence in the social solidarity which we need. To summarise, perhaps what struck me most in your speech; above all, you wished to remind us that, beyond its economic aspects, the task of constructing Europe is a spiritual one. We of course look forward most keenly to continuing this task with you. Thank you, Mr President. (The formal sitting was closed at 12.40 p.m.) ACP-EU Joint Assembly The next item is the annual report (A5-0032/2000) by Mr Corrie, on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the activities of the ACS-EU Joint Assembly in 1999. , rapporteur.- Mr President, I had hoped to be rising at 9 a.m., not 9 p.m., to present this report. I hope the number of Members in this Chamber is not an indication of the interest in overseas development work. However, it is normal practice that the report on the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly is put before Members of this Parliament and I have the pleasant task of doing that tonight. Once again, I can report two highly successful Assemblies having taken place, one in Strasbourg and one in Nassau. In many ways this was the end of an old era and the start of a new one. The ACP-EU Joint Assembly is a unique organisation in world politics. Where else do 86 nations come together to discuss matters of mutual concern? The Strasbourg Assembly was the last chaired by Lord Plumb. In honour of the tremendous work he carried out over a difficult period the Joint Bureau in Nassau made him an honorary president, and we wish him well in his retirement. The two Assemblies have been dominated by the negotiations on renewal of the Lomé Convention and I look forward to the signature of a new Convention and its rapid ratification by all the countries concerned. I remember that at the last mid-term review, when I was rapporteur, the then Commissioner Marin said that review would be the last. Well, he was wrong, and I pay tribute to Philip Lowe and his team who have worked so successfully behind the scenes to conclude a new Convention in very difficult circumstances. I was also delighted to hear the report this morning from Commissioner Nielson who has worked untiringly to get the right outcome to the negotiations. I pay special tribute to him for his success. I also pay tribute to Mrs Kinnock and her working group for the huge amount of work they put in on the future of Lomé.	it
What is more, the work carried out in Brussels should be of a much higher quality and be completely transparent, so that people might at least have some small sense of owning the process, now that Mr Prodi and his predecessor have taken their autonomy away from them. I should also just like to draw Mr Dell' Alba' s attention to what the founding fathers of the European Union dreamed of. Take a look at Jean Monet' s memoirs. What he envisaged was what he called a small, practical secretariat. That is not what Mr Prodi is President of today. Madam President, this morning the Commission President, Mr Prodi, has set out ambitious goals for the European Union for the next five years, laudable aims indeed, to make a strong and effective European presence felt in the world: succeeding with enlargement, meeting the challenge of selling e-Europe, introducing better principles of governance. We accept that Europeans, particularly the younger generation, need to be given a broad perspective of where Europe will be in the years ahead. But how are we to succeed when the resources available are limited and the credibility of our institutions is not very high? We need to match this vision with reality. Here there are three elements I would like to contribute. Firstly, we need a successful European economy. We must ensure that unemployment rates continue to go down across Europe, confirm the trend in privatisation and deregulation, encourage the insertion of information technology and knowledge of the Internet, show that e-Europe is a good initiative. But we must avoid lurching back into the old-style regulation, stifling individual initiative and enterprise. We must not fear globalisation, but we must also make sure that we understand its political impact in the network society. Without a successful European economy we cannot meet the challenges ahead, particularly of enlargement. Secondly, we need to ensure that we legislate only when necessary - subsidiarity. Doing less but better - a central plank of the last Commission - needs to be the aim of this Commission too. We will be looking at this closely when we come to the annual programmes of proposed legislation. Mr Bonde was right to say that there is this image of doing less better and then suddenly we see an annual programme for the year 2000 of 500 proposals and recommendations, which seems to go in a different direction. We must establish priorities and make sure there is value for money in each of these programmes. Lastly, we need to ensure that there is proper, genuine reform of the European Commission. Yes, the Commission - guardian of the Treaties - is meant to be an independent body, but it also has to be accountable to European citizens through our Parliament. The information problem, which Mr Bonde just referred to, is treated like a straw in the wind, with the Commission seeming to restrict information to us, as citizens and as parliamentarians, although we have the right to it under the Treaties.	fr
The advent of the euro at the beginning of last year unleashed enormous competitive forces within European business which are being met by a merger wave of quite unprecedented proportions. For example, the figures for last year now show that the total value of mergers in the European area was EUR 1.4 trillion, which is seven times the level of merger activity at the peak of the last European merger boom in 1990. This poses enormous challenges for competition policy, which I hope it will be able to meet because, for certain, many of those mergers are going to be designed to protect profit margins of the businesses from competition rather than merely to enhance productivity and make those businesses able to operate on a bigger scale. Commissioner Monti and his colleagues have a tremendous challenge ahead of them and our worries in the ELDR Group are that there should be no weakening in the thrust of competition policy either in the examination of mergers or the monitoring of restrictive practices. Delegation to national authorities is all very well but we would emphasise what Mr von Wogau said in his report on the need for regular monitoring of national authorities to ensure that there is no slippage in the European element, and, particularly would ask the Commissioner to reassure us that there would be random checks on that. Mr President, in the limited time I have, I would like to express my support for the work carried out by all the rapporteurs and my agreement with many of the things which have been said here, in particular by Mr Jonckheer, who criticised the excessive gathering of information and the lack of transparency and socio-economic balance in the granting of aid. I also agree with the criticism that no emphasis has been put on the implementation of Article 82, especially when we are witnessing abusive conduct in a context of market concentration. As a Member for the Basque Country, I would like to express my total support for the implementation measures for fair competition in the market. I say this in case there is any doubt about the criticisms which we have directed at the Commission in general, and Mr Monti, in particular, for its persecution of the incentives to Basque companies and the fact that it considers them to be state aid. Our discrepancy stems from the fact that the Commission continues to misunderstand the character of the general system and the co-responsibility of our arrangement which gives our Basque fiscal rules the same nature, foundation and aim as the rules of the Member States of the Union, and that they are applied in a general way to all tax-payers who, by virtue of points which fall under an external system of law, are subject to those rules. Mr President, Commissioner, competition is exactly what we need. We need competition if there is the least unemployment, for a smooth-running healthcare system, for social justice, for high social standards, and, of course, we also need - these are competition criteria to do with the economy - business management competition so as to achieve highest-quality products, equal market access conditions for all enterprises, and environmentally-friendly products.	it
The Union cannot be enlarged to 28 without addressing the matter of whether Europe has certain joint principles and values, whether it comes down to an economic free trade area, or whether, on the other hand, it has a greater ambition: the desire to be a supranational union, in ways that have yet to be defined, that wants to blaze a trail for civilisation and democracy in the world. This is what is and was meant by the call for a European Constitution. The amendment of the Treaties was, however, limited to a review of some internal rules, which was necessary and important, but did not answer the fundamental question: what is Europe, what are its common principles and therefore, its objectives and limitations? However, politics exacts its revenge, and having been thrown out of the window by a debate on a limited agenda, it comes back in, as a matter of fact, through a door, and through the front door in the case of Austria, since a party is entering the Austrian Government which seems to represent a return to intolerance, xenophobia and forms of racism. And it is not a question of links with the past; it is a question of prospects for the future, and nothing could be more wrong than the right and left taking a divided stand on this. I belong to a world, the world of Liberal Catholics, which is not left-wing but which holds as dear as anyone else the values of tolerance and common European values, and will have nothing to do with policies that reject these values. The Council has done well to lay open this subject to Europe and to the world and if we do not set down these values in a Charter of Fundamental Rights, in a European Constitution, then we shall construct a Europe without a solid, lasting base. Commissioner Barnier, I know - at least I think I know - that you and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency share these values: make the most of the chances you were given by the December Conference to include these subjects and principles, because this is the only way we will build a lasting Europe. Mr President, I am in the happy position of being able to refer to a couple of striking contributions from a small group of Nordic sceptics and opponents of the drastic and growing integration process which, looked long and hard at, threatens the whole of democratic Europe. I am thinking of the contributions from Mr Bonde and Mr Sjöstedt who point out that the present contribution contains a string of relatively unconscious but undoubtedly rational initiatives dictated by the desire for power and pointing in the direction of a centralist and federalist EU. They rightly included the problem with monetary union and centralist government and presented a number of alternative democratic principles. I might add that all rational political campaigning in my own country, Denmark, takes it for granted that, when we enlarge the circle of EU countries to include the envisaged huge number of new Member States and when we in that way extend the breadth of the Union, we cannot at the same time pursue further integration in depth, that is to say engage in a more intensive qualitative integration towards a United States of Europe. However, that is precisely what is happening.	it
I voted for it, not just because I was born in a coastal town, Genoa, but above all because the frontiers of regions bordered by the sea are frontiers too. These frontiers stretch as far as African states and the Middle East: we must take greater account of the fact that it is also important to develop coastal regions in every part of Europe. As an MEP from a border region, I welcome this third INTERREG initiative with great interest. We can never talk enough about the difficulties experienced in the past by maritime and landlocked border regions which have been cut off economically, socially and culturally. Due to the existence of these borders, they have become peripheral areas within the countries to which they belong. This has too often led the national authorities to neglect these regions in national policy. This is why the INTERREG Community Initiative was launched in 1990. This programme was designed to encourage cross-border, transnational and interregional cooperation and to promote balanced development of the Community territory in order to enhance economic and social cohesion in the Union. INTERREG serves principally to fund Community schemes to develop SMEs, education and training, cultural exchanges, action to combat health problems, the protection and improvement of the environment, energy, transport and telecommunications networks. I must stress that interregional cooperation significantly encourages the involvement of local and regional authorities in the process of European integration. More active participation by these authorities in Community initiatives should be promoted, bearing in mind that in many cases they have a very limited capacity for cooperation because of the different legal frameworks and different levels of development on either side of the border. In cross-border cooperation, greater emphasis must be placed on improving the conditions for the economic activity of the small and medium-sized undertakings which are the job creators. In the same respect, given that structural unemployment is responsible for 50% of all unemployment, the INTERREG funds made available must be sufficient to supplement national measures promoting employment. Obstacles too often caused by double taxation and social protection are preventing, braking or hindering cross-border mobility. I hope that the projects included within the programmes can help to provide solutions to these problems and to implement in practical terms the principle of free movement of workers which is in a bad way in my region! INTERREG resources must also contribute to the development of a European research area. Finally, and in particular, expectations in the regions about this initiative are high given that small towns not eligible for Objective 2 funding are hoping to obtain compensation through INTERREG! The challenges are therefore immense. The integration of the border regions will be an essential element in the development of a future European regional development policy! I hope everyone, like Mr Decourrière, whom I congratulate, will realise this! - (FR) The INTERREG Community Initiative is just one element of an ill-fated European regional policy. This apparently generous policy, officially intended to help problem regions, is a fool' s bargain for French taxpayers. France contributes 17% of the European budget yet will receive only 8% of the regional Structural Funds.	de
(The sitting was suspended at 12.05 a.m.) Shipwreck of the Erika The next item is the oral question (B5-0011/2000) by Mr Varela Suanzes-Carpegna, on behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, to the Commission, on the shipwreck of the Erika. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, firstly I want to warmly thank Mr Fischler for being here today. Our President told us yesterday that the Commissioner would be unable to attend today due to prior commitments. He must have reconsidered and, in so doing, has, as usual, shown great respect for this House. I thank him for this. On behalf of the Committee on Fisheries, I must highlight our concerns about the shipwreck of the tanker Erika. There are two political reasons why our committee and myself as its chairman must speak out about this issue. Firstly, we must show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that this House cannot and will not forget about this serious incident. Secondly, we must focus today on one specific aspect of this terrible environmental disaster, namely its effect on the fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected regions. The epilogue to this disaster must surely be the urgent adoption of measures to minimise the damage and to prevent this happening again in the future. Enough regrets and thoughts have been expressed about this event. We must now get down to adopting measures, Commissioner. Firstly, efficient controls are needed in Community waters and ports in order to ensure safety in maritime transport, particularly where oil and dangerous goods are involved. The construction of these vessels, the use of double hulls, their age, their control by classification companies, insurance, the creation of databases containing all relevant information, Community cooperation and coordination, the reinforcement of control by inspectors and the liability of carriers and owners of cargoes are all issues which must be tackled. Who better than the European Commission to make serious proposals for European harmonisation in these areas? Flags of convenience must also be specifically monitored and regulated in maritime transport, particularly as they do so much damage to the fisheries which we have taken to calling 'responsible fisheries' . Access into Community waters of vessels flying flags of convenience which do not meet Community safety standards must be controlled. We expect concrete action from the European Commission. The fisheries and aquaculture sectors in the affected areas of Brittany and the Vendée are particularly important, well-developed and prestigious. The European Commission must therefore publicise the damage caused and its assessment of this damage. It must also indicate all the specific measures, including political, economic, social and financial measures, which it intends to adopt in order to minimise the damage and compensate the fishermen and industries which have been dramatically affected overnight. How can consumer confidence in products from this area be regained? How can those affected be compensated? This is a very serious problem which the European Union, as an economic, commercial, industrial and fishing power, must tackle. We must get to work and lead the way in these issues which are damaging our environment and destroying industries and occupations.	fr
I am opposing Amendments 7 to 13 which were decisively rejected by the Fisheries Committee. Most of their content is either unnecessary or already referred to in my text. In particular, I have drawn attention to the need to study the extent and effect of interaction between farmed and wild salmon, the need to investigate the source of ISA and the need to test more widely for the virus in wild stocks. These amendments by the Green component of the Greens/European Free Alliance Group are designed to provide justification for Amendment 13. This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate as it seeks not only to retain the requirement for immediate compulsory slaughter of all fish but also to prevent any fish, whether diseased or not, from an affected farm from being sold and I must emphasise that under current policy no diseased fish are sold. There is no proposal to change that and under the proposed new regime there is no question of diseased fish being sold. Amendments 7 to 13 simply fail to take account of the reality as evidenced by the starkly contrasting statistics from Scotland and from Norway. In Scotland we have endured a draconian regime which has failed to achieve its objective. In Norway, with their much longer experience, compulsory, 100% culling was abandoned some years ago and a range of measures have led there to a dramatically improved situation. It is in all of our interests to ensure that in Scotland too we contain ISA and prevent its further spread. Last week saw the publication in Scotland of a report by a joint government and industry working group on ISA. This comprehensive document takes account of a wide range of possible risks and recommends action to combat them in areas such as site-to-site transmission, security measures to curtail escapes, treatment of waste and effluent, methods of detection and diagnosis, farrowing and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many, many more. Some can and will be implemented immediately by local authorities using existing powers, others will be incorporated into codes of practice. All will be beneficial, not just in relation to ISA but in achieving better standards in aquaculture generally where required. Your votes, colleagues, in favour of my report in full, as endorsed by the Fisheries Committee, will be a very important part of a wider ISA control package based on the reality of Scotland' s situation and the lessons learned from the success of others. I congratulate Mr Hudghton and fully support his report and would urge the honourable Members of Parliament to do likewise. As he said, fish farming is a critically significant source of employment in remote parts of rural Scotland and at a time when the rural areas of Scotland are suffering their worst recession in over a hundred years, the aquaculture industry provides an essential boost to the rural economy on which many thousands of direct and indirect jobs depend. Now, as he said, in excess of 85 000 tons of Salmon is now produced in Scottish fish farms in an industry which generates more than EUR 800 million annually.	it
Amendment No 16 jeopardises the protection of investors because a blocked security deposit with a third party custodian is a contradiction in terms. Neither are securities lending transactions via securities clearing houses or exchanges - as opposed to the purchase and sale of securities - automatically covered by these institutions. We cannot, therefore, adopt the proposed Amendment for this reason. Amendment No 42 relates to a provision which was not changed by the proposal and which has not caused any problems since the implementation of the directive. I therefore cannot see any reason why Article 22, paragraph 3 should be omitted and reject the amendment for this reason. Amendment No 44 cannot be accepted because, if it is prescribed that non-harmonised funds are subject to rules which have been 'imposed by the directive' concerning lending, borrowing, selling from an uncovered position and the third party custodian, this will indeed lead to a situation where very few funds, for example Swiss funds, would be eligible for investment. This goes against the Commission' s intention to widen the scope of investments, and the wording thereof could contravene GATS agreements. Amendment No 47 is unacceptable as far as the proposed changes to the first paragraph of Article 22a are concerned, because this proposal completely clashes with the spreading rules of Article 22, especially when the UCITS are obliged to indicate a point of reference in their prospectuses, as discussed in the Council. The key issue regarding the first proposal, however, is Parliament' s amendment which allows the use of over-the-counter instruments for general investment purposes. The Commission points out that, according to the national legislation of some Member States, the use of OTC derivatives for general investment purposes is already authorised. However, the Commission will be suspending its position, given the intrinsically high risks of these investments compared to the more traditional financial instruments. I believe that OTC instruments could lead to problems, because they are not liquid, the price is difficult to estimate and they entail uncovered counterparty risks. It seems inconsistent to opt for an extremely prudent approach with regard to investments as non-harmonised funds or deposits and, at the same time, freely to allow investments in clearly more risky OTC instruments. By rejecting the rapporteur' s Amendment No 39, the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs has aligned itself with the Council. The upshot of this amendment by Parliament would be that funds are allowed, in theory, to invest in OTC instruments and to trade the rights of participation in their funds across the entire internal market. In practice, access to other EU markets for these theoretically harmonised funds which invest in OTC instruments can be blocked by applying different national legislative frameworks and protective measures against OTC investments. This would contravene the fact that EU legislation applies to all funds which invest in OTC instruments. Given this possibly negative effect on the internal market and the risks inherent in OTC instruments, the Commission cannot accept Amendments Nos 12, 15, 37, 38, 39, 43, 46 and 48 and parts of Amendments Nos 17, 36 and 45 which pertain to OTC instruments.	it
Indeed you responded in kind, as I knew you would do. I would like to draw your attention to something Mr Goodwill asked, that is to the connections we make between the precautionary principle and the world beyond the European Union. I have good reason for asking this. As you rightly said, the precautionary principle is needed in precisely those areas where, as yet, there is no scientific evidence. How can we ensure that we will not be laying ourselves open to attack at any time, for example by our partners in the USA, on account of the bio safety protocol not being adequate to their purposes? How can we be sure that those of your colleagues responsible for industrial policy and foreign trade policy, will not, as they did on the last few occasions with your predecessors, keep pulling the carpet from underneath you? That is exactly what it is all about, otherwise we might as well not bother talking about the precautionary principle here, Commissioner! Mr President, I think it is extremely important to point to the present communication' s guidelines for using the precautionary principle as a way of repudiating assertions to the effect that we always want to use the principle for protectionist reasons. I am certain that we are going to have more conflicts, for example with the United States. We should not be so naïve as to think otherwise. Ever since we signed this protocol in Montreal, we nonetheless have international recognition and a common definition written into a protocol dealing with the environment, health and trade. This constitutes a good example, therefore. We should be in no doubt that conflicts may arise in the future too, but we can now show that we do not use the precautionary principle arbitrarily. We now have a number of guidelines for using the precautionary principle, and we have increased support among our respective peoples for using it, something which is clearly established in the present communication. Thank you, Commissioner. The focus on the political precautionary principle means that we have being discussing it for almost two hours and this topic is now being viewed, so to speak, as more than an ordinary aspect of administration, even though, as we have been able to establish from the interventions, questions and replies, it is a topic which we believe to be of considerable importance. The debate is closed. Intergovernmental Conference The next item is the report (A5-0018/2000) by Mr Dimitrakopoulos and Mr Leinen, on behalf of the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, on the convening of the Intergovernmental Conference [14094/1999 - C5-0341/1999 - 1999/0825(CNS)]. Mr President, I will begin by thanking the Portuguese Presidency and the Commission for all our recent very useful contacts. Let me also once more thank my co-rapporteur Mr Leinen for our excellent collaboration. The Intergovernmental Conference that is about to begin is important, both in a general sense and more particularly in view of the imminent enlargement. The work of the Conference will determine the structure and method based on which Europe will be functioning in the twentieth century. For the European Union of the future to be able to function more effectively, more democratically and with complete transparency, clearly what we need is an extensive and in-depth reform of the institutions and the way they work. The first and substantive prerequisite for achieving that reform is the agenda based on which the Intergovernmental Conference is to begin its work. From the decisions made at the Helsinki Summit, it emerges that the agenda agreed there is unsatisfactory and does not guarantee the essential and substantive changes required for creating a more functional Europe, one that is more effective, more democratic and more transparent.	de
"As far as the Commission is concerned, it will, ladies and gentlemen, be taking initiatives to inaugurate and orchestrate this public debate. Cross-border services - (DE) Mr President, Commissioner, firstly I would like to apologise for being a little hoarse today, but we Austrian MEPs have had a lot of explaining and talking to do. I would first like to say how indebted I am to the Commission for seizing the initiative, and for the two draft directives we are discussing here today. It has thereby succeeded in closing two serious loopholes in the internal market which are of great significance to the European economy and to 5 million third-country nationals in the European Union who are here as workers or on a self-employed basis. The current state of play - and we would do well to remind ourselves of this again - is that there are in fact judgements from the European Court of Justice relating to employees, I refer in particular to those relating to the Rush Portuguesa case and that of van der Elst. These have, in fact, clarified that the freedom to provide services must allow for third-country nationals to be taken on as employees of cross-border services and this without having to obtain work permits. However, the European Court of Justice did not make specific reference to the issue of visa requirements and conditions of residence and consequently the Member States were unable to clarify this issue. Furthermore, not all Member States have abided by the Court of Justice' s verdicts with regards to the lapsing of the work permit requirement, and they still have a multiplicity of unacceptable barriers in place in respect of cross-border services; barriers that are often impossible to overcome, especially for the smaller companies. The situation as far as self-employed people are concerned is that current Community invested legal rights do not afford third-country nationals the right to provide cross-border services. There is no doubt that we need a legislative act here. Both draft directives seek to facilitate the freedom to provide services for EU enterprises. It is not about establishing original rights for third-country nationals modelled on freedom of movement. All provisions, i.e. issues relating to entry into the EU and to the law pertaining to residence rights, should be regarded as ancillary to this freedom to provide services. I, together with the European Parliament' s Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, are therefore of the opinion that the Commission has chosen the right legal bases and that the opposite view, as expressed in the report produced by the Council' s Legal Service, is inappropriate. Consequently, I do not see that there is any real obstacle to the Council' s being able to move matters on quickly as far as these two draft directives are concerned. I also believe that Parliament' s proposed amendments should make it easier for the Council to adopt the directives as opposed to the Commission' s proposal. Many of our amendments relate back to concerns that were also voiced in the Council, and we are attempting to reconcile these concerns with the task that falls to us by dint of extant law and economic good sense. When it comes to acceptance by the Council, I can only urge the Commission to adopt as many of the amendments adopted by Parliament as possible, even if some of them deviate substantially from the original Commission proposals. I am absolutely convinced that it will be easier for us to achieve consensus in the Council on this basis. Turning now to the most important of our proposed amendments, one of the essential differences is that, in place of a ""service provision card plus notification for each individual contract"" system, provision is no longer made for being able to request the previous notification from the receiving state for each individual contract."	de
This morning there were seven helicopters and of course those helicopters are only working in the Gaza region. The Save river has huge flooding problems as well but no one has even been there yet. 85% of the work is within an hour of Maputo so we really have no idea what the extent of the problem is. Also I would like to say Commissioner that European citizens want to know exactly what ECHO is doing. Most of us here would not wish to boast about EUR 3 million. We need far more and I hope that the Commissioner will come back with those promises and also with an initiative to coordinate some of the efforts there. Clearly also we need to see a massive airlift. As you say tons of food, water purification equipment, tents, blankets. Are we really prepared for the next relief and rehabilitation stage which you mention because that again will demand massive resources. Are we ready to pay for those resources? Mozambique is, of course, one of the poorest countries in the world, but one of Africa' s great success stories with its work on economic growth, on poverty reduction, on democracy in spite, of course, of massive debt pressures. Mozambique is a wonderful example but now likely to suffer enormous hardship as a result of what they have endured. How badly the disaster sets Mozambique back is what we should be looking at now and that depends on the sheer quality and quantity of international relief for that stricken country. Thank you, Mrs Kinnock. Mr Nogueira, we note your interest and concern about this subject but your Group is not down to speak and I must abide by the Rules of Procedure. The debate is closed. Union Economy (1999) The next item is the report (A5-0041/2000) by Mr Katiforis, on behalf of the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, on the Commission document 'The EU Economy 1999 Review' [C5-0081/2000 - 2000/2046(COS)]. The report of the Commission presents an assessment of the current economic position of the European economy which it finds promising, especially in terms of the recent recovery of economic growth expected to lead to a reduction of unemployment to 8% by the year 2001. This picture in the opinion of your rapporteur has to be set against a background of sluggishness, of growth of only 1.9% per year throughout the 1990s, despite instances of higher growth rates during that decade which we were, however, unable to consolidate. It would follow that if we do not wish the same old failures of the past to reassert themselves, we must use the current window of opportunity of improved economic performance in order to launch a new policy of transition into self-sustained higher growth levels in our economy. This is the challenge. Faced with this challenge the Commission recommended essentially that our economic policy merely should prolong our past stance which limits itself to setting right the monetary and fiscal fundamentals of the economy while for the rest putting faith in the markets to work their miracle without any further intervention by conscious social agents.	es
Is there a Member who wishes to speak on behalf of the PSE Group in favour of this proposal? Madam President, I clearly owe Mr Wurtz an explanation, and I am going give this explanation before the whole House. We had reached this agreement on principle in the Conference of Presidents. At the time, I did not know that Commissioner Bolkestein was going to appear next week before the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism to discuss this matter. My group has debated this matter and considers that, given the current situation of the whole process of market integration and deregulation in such a sensitive area, it is appropriate that Parliament makes an initial statement, regardless of any action it may take in the future, so that Commissioner Bolkestein may take good note and in order to guide next week' s debate. Madam President, I should simply like to ask Mr Wurtz to take a second look at what this is about. It has nothing to do with any disputes on the substance; it is just about the following question: when will the Commission - having already had a year and a half to do this - finally be in a position to table the directive? Our sole intention in tabling the motion is to ensure that the deadlines which were promised are now finally adhered to, and it is therefore important that we act as quickly as possible. That is why I should like to support the Social Democrats' request to hold the vote on Friday. (Parliament gave its assent) Madam President, as you know the Cederschiöld report has been taken off Thursday' s agenda. That ought to mean that we have more time on Thursday. Since we will be very pressed for time in the topical and urgent debate, in view of the many matters to be addressed in an hour and a half, I simply wanted to ask whether the sessional services might not check to see whether we could have an extra half an hour for the topical and urgent debate so that there is sufficient speaking time. In general the way in which sittings have been managed in recent weeks seems to me to have been very chaotic. Last Thursday speaking times were extremely tight and then suddenly we had between one and one-and-a-half hours when there was nothing on the agenda and we had to wait for the vote. On Friday of this week we have one single item on the agenda. That is absolutely absurd. I really should like to ask that a review be carried out of the way in which sittings are managed. This sounds perfectly feasible. We shall therefore see if we can extend the urgent debate by a half hour, considering the withdrawal of Mrs Cederschiöld' s report. This is all I am talking about here, just that. Madam President, I would like to talk about an item on the agenda for Wednesday, which you have not yet announced.	es
"I will give you an example: the European Union was right to support the Grönitz steelworks in Brandenburg, although out of 5 000 jobs only 700 remained. But these are competitive jobs, for this steelworks is now the number two tool steel manufacturer in the Federal Republic of Germany. Anyone who would jeopardise production at this steelworks on principle, by demanding the return of the aid that was granted at the time, would not just place the steelworks itself in jeopardy but also one of the region' s employers that small and medium-sized enterprises are, of course, dependent on too. It goes without saying that that is not what the European Union' s competition policy is designed to achieve. If we want there to be competition then we must establish this link between the requirements of the national economy and the pre-requisites of managerial economics. Indeed that is the only way to build up regional economic circulation in the under-developed regions that will protect people' s social welfare and boost purchasing power. To that end, we must also make it our business to take more account of demand-orientated economic policy as opposed to one focusing heavily on supply. Mr President, ever since I was elected to this Parliament in 1994 I have never witnessed a report which had such anti-Irish sentiments and overtones as the Jonckheer report which we are debating today. I would like to quote verbatim from the report: ""State aid per capita is highest in Italy, Germany and Ireland. Ireland clearly is in the lead when national and Community regional and social funds are put together."" I believe that the rapporteur is simply playing with figures. I find it difficult to understand how he can index regional and social funds into this mathematical equation. I should like to remind the Member that the European Union has agreed to the new regional aid guidelines for the period 2000 plus. This was merely an extension of the policy objectives to complete the internal market within Europe. Regional disparities must be overcome if the internal market is to succeed and prosper. I welcome the fact that grant aid of 40% and a top-up of 15% for SMEs for fixed investment will be permitted for companies setting up in Objective 1 regions in Europe post-2000. I remind Mr Jonckheer that Irish companies or foreign companies in Ireland still have to cross two sea masses to reach the mainland European marketplace. No other Member State is at such a disadvantage. Mr President, the monopolies' ban is the key element of functioning competition order in Europe. The Commission deemed the practical administration relating to the monitoring of the monopolies' ban to be unsatisfactory, something I would wholeheartedly agree with. But opinion differs as to the solution. The Commission' s proposal does not formally deviate from the monopolies ban but the upshot of this proposal is a transition from a ban with permit reservation to a permit with ban reservation. In other words, we are making the transition from the principle of banning to that of misuse."	es
"The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability. That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide. I would like to explain our thinking here. Firstly, we are concerned with the proper use of the Structural and Cohesion Funds. Past experience dictates that, as the elected representatives of the European taxpayer, we should, and indeed must, demand financial probity and transparency in the disbursement and auditing of this money, hence our amendments and additions relate to achieving what are known as ""value for money"" indicators in the grant-giving process. Next, we all too often see vast sums of money being spent on projects whose outcomes will necessarily be unclear at the start of the programme period. But at the mid-way point or end of that period there is no effective way of terminating the project if it has not proved successful. Our additions therefore call for the provision of practical enforceable exit strategies so that not only can we have the requisite insurance against ongoing costs which are often loaded onto the taxpayer, but we also avoid the well-rehearsed syndrome of throwing good money after bad. Finally, we call for a change to the balance and method by which the funds are disbursed. There should be greater involvement of the private sector which will introduce financial reality as a perspective within the funding equation. Also the type of project funded needs to be shifted away from small-scale revenue-based projects, which are hard to monitor, towards capital schemes where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are there for all to see. That way the much-trumpeted need for transparency in the use of these funds and the temptation to draw unnecessarily in the longer term on the local tax base in areas where such projects are located will be diminished and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such reform. If these changes to the report are supported by the House today, I believe that they will move us forward in the next phase of achieving the historic objectives which the funds were set up to bring about, namely to assist - in a financially sustainable manner - those deprived areas of the European Union which need to be brought up to a decent standard of living, not by giving a hand-out but by giving a ""hand-up"". I urge the House to support these changes. Mr President, Commissioner, I too would like to commend the rapporteur on her report, which is a meticulous and substantive piece of work. The European Union' s structural and cohesion policies are, without doubt, essential tools for creating the right conditions with a view to tackling and reducing the levels of economic and social disparity between the regions. Despite the steps taken thus far, these levels are still very high, and are unacceptably high as regards unemployment."	es
I am beginning to feel a little worried because this may lead, partially at least, to exclusion. I do not see how you could, with the views that you hold, provide any answers. What I asked and what I am once again asking is the following: what are the views of the Portuguese Presidency on, for example, the appeals made by the network to combat poverty and exclusion, the division of work and social security, the implementation of tax policies, particularly for speculative capital, and the policy of redistributing wealth? I would like an answer as to whether or not the Portuguese Presidency intends to do something about these matters. You must understand that a presidency' s ability to reverse global social or economic trends during its six months in office is actually quite limited. I think that it is also obvious that our ability to act is linked to the Commission' s own scope for intervening, through its right of initiative. I have spoken about the Special European Council and about Portugal' s initiative in convening it, and I have spoken about the future, because there are two complementary ways of seeing the issue of social exclusion. One of them is the series of measures which must be adopted immediately in order to deal with the specific effects of social exclusion. The second is to create internationally competitive conditions, which will enable us to improve the economic fabric of the European Union, and this will have positive knock-on effects on the problems of social exclusion. The Portuguese Presidency does not have a magic wand with which it can, in six months, resolve problems that have always existed. It is prepared to act on proposals by the Commission in any area for which there is Community competence. It also has the opportunity and the desire to promote the whole raft of measures which may be presented, specifically by non-governmental organisations, but also through the intergovernmental collaboration which is traditional in these matters. We should, however, also bear in mind, Mr Papayannakis, that we cannot act in an area which will have such a big financial impact, armed only with the measures a presidency can propose in the space of six months. We therefore think that all the measures we have highlighted in terms of long-term strategies, regardless of the fact that we know that in the long term, some of the homeless may be dead, will help us to guarantee sustainable policies in the European Union. We will try to move these strategies forward as much as possible during our presidency. Question No 12 by (H-0801/99): Subject: Portuguese Presidency and development policy Will the President-in-Office of the Council make a statement on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency with regard to development policy, the Convention of Lomé and tackling famine situations? I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer to my question, and indeed the Minister who spoke to the Committee on Development last week in Brussels outlining the position. But there are some questions still outstanding. There does not seem to be any emphasis on the fight against AIDS in the programme.	de
All of us can only hope that the Special Summit is able to live up to the high expectations which people have of it. Because, as you have already stressed, we do not need one more process after another, one procedure after another; rather we need action by which the people of the European Union can measure the benefits and added value of what the European Union does. That is also why you have rightly drawn together employment, economic reform, growth and social cohesion and made them issues for top-level action. It is important for all players in the governments and in the Commission to be pulling in the same direction towards full employment. Then it will also be possible to convince all economic policy-makers of the need to conform to agreed behaviour, which so far they unfortunately still have not yet done. Europe need lament neither over the success of the US economy nor over the strong dollar if it does not learn any lessons for itself from it. Reforms of financial services, services capital and labour markets are certainly useful and necessary. But they alone will not give growth the stimulus it needs to enable long-lasting growth, effectively generating jobs, to be organised at a high level. We were forced to experience this several times in the nineties. An average productivity increase of 2% requires a growth rate of 3.5% for full employment to be able to be achieved within ten years. This scenario has moved into the foreseeable future. That is why full employment actually needs to be right at the top of the agenda. We need to set a growth target of at least 3%. The aim of full employment cannot be achieved by economic policy alone. The Europe of innovation and the information society also need to be commandeered to reach this target. We are a long way from it today. We must also recognise that we need another type of economic and financial policy. It is simply unacceptable for shareholders or directors of plcs to be the only ones who decide on jobs, the economy and share prices. When 13-year-old school children play on the computer after school at restructuring their parents' share portfolios, then this has more to do with toy casinos than with responsibility. I think that the Special Summit in Lisbon will herald responsible economic planning in the European Union. Mr President, Prime Minister, President of the Commission, the Portuguese Presidency has presented an ambitious programme for the Special Summit. Congratulations! I also welcome the support which Portugal is receiving from the Commission, not least through the communication which seeks to develop the Community into an information society for everyone. The comment made by the Christian Democrat Prime Minister, Jean Claude Juncker, at the employment summit in Luxembourg in 1997 also applies to the Lisbon Summit. He said that it must not be a literary convention, referring to the numerous non-binding declarations made at many summits. In adopting the Luxembourg Process the Heads of State and Government achieved tangible successes.	es
"I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr von Wogau, for his commitment and I welcome his thoughts. Moreover, I would like to say that I appreciate the remarks and observations that Professor Tesauro, Chairman of the Italian Competition Authority, sent me, and which I am sure Mr Monti will take into due account with a strong sense of collaboration. Our real concern is undoubtedly to initiate further liberalisation of the market, and, above all, to achieve consistency between the different national markets. As things stand, there are considerable differences between them which come to the fore if we compare the English, Italian and French markets. There is a large degree of state protectionism in the French market which is not found in the English market and is only present to an extremely limited extent in Italy. Another issue concerns the economies of countries involved in enlargement, which may run the risk of remaining assisted economies for ever more if provision is not made for gradual adjustment. In my opinion, we should also create a threshold below which two significant components which characterise our economic structure should be placed: small and medium-sized businesses, which bind the European economy together, and social protection, which Europe has always guaranteed to the weakest parts of the economy. Safeguarding the social function of the market is what makes the difference between free trade, pure and simple, and a system for improving people' s quality of life. A point to consider regarding the new rules concerns the economy of the outermost regions and islands, all of which must be protected. We ought therefore to consider creating two focal points of an external market by instigating profitable relations with Russia and the Mediterranean countries, precisely so that their economies become less peripheral. I hope - and I thank Mr Monti for this - that the new rules will reflect as many aspects of economic policy as possible and that their social function will be guaranteed. Mr President, competition is at the heart of the European internal market policy and is also its driving force. A free and open market can only exist by the grace of competition, marked by clear, uniform rules. In his report, Karl von Wogau manages to capture this very well. But Europe is changing. The economies are growing, we are enlarging to 25-30 Member States. The European Commission will become overburdened if it pursues its current policy. It is therefore necessary to modernise competition policy. This is not in question. Having said this, I still have concerns about the proposed decentralisation. How will the Commission, as keeper of the Treaties, guarantee that decisions are taken uniformly in matters of competition in London, Palermo, Helsinki and, soon, Budapest and Ankara? This is necessary if legal inequality is to be prevented, and issues of competition will gravitate towards the court where the most lenient judgements are given. It is not enough to say that, in the Member States, there is already 40 years' worth of experience. In the Netherlands, the competition authority is still in its infancy. This country has a very small market which, unfortunately, is often at the same time defined as the relevant market. This in contrast to Germany, where a very experienced Kartellamt is exercising its powers within a gigantic market. The European Commission' s belief that, in all quarters of the Union, legislation will, almost as a matter of course, be interpreted in the same way, is what, within catholic circles, we term ""foolhardy,"" and this is not allowed."	de
"It symbolises the need for solidarity with the countries of the south, particularly those in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific which questioned us extensively on this subject in Seattle. In order to fully achieve its objective, the money supply released by such a tax must be redistributed among the poorest countries. This is how we can give sense and morality to the commercial rules and show solidarity with the people of the south. Madam President, we cannot just keep repeating the number which several previous speakers have quoted; we must also mention the fact, Commissioner, that 80% of these huge, daily foreign exchange sales have an investment term of no more than eight days. We cannot maintain a situation in which investments and the creation of jobs are less lucrative than short-term sales of foreign currency and shares. We cannot maintain a situation in which we allow ourselves to destroy the opportunity to take political action. We cannot maintain a situation in which income from non-economic activities increases more and more quickly. It has been demonstrated in Germany that income from monetary assets has almost doubled from 7.6% of overall economic income since Tobin developed his idea. We cannot maintain a situation in which the poorest countries of the world are most exposed to the speculative arguments surrounding short-term currency fluctuations. Nor do I believe that this is impracticable. Why should it not be possible for the G7 countries, the other EU Member States, China, Singapore and Switzerland to come to an agreement on the introduction of the Tobin tax? There must be an overriding economic interest. Why should it be impracticable, and it can be differentiated, to impose this tax on spot foreign exchange transactions, all the so-called cash transactions, currency futures and options? Why should it be impracticable to set this tax at a rate which does not jeopardise the long-term investments needed by the economy but which finally makes short-term and speculative investments unattractive. Numerous very difficult questions are bound to arise, but the only real problem which I can see so far is one of political will and the St. Florian principle of shifting responsibility from one agency to another which has now taken hold. Madam President, we are not asking for more bureaucracy, as Mr Karas put it just a few minutes ago. We are looking for solutions. Of course capital markets need clarity - that is actually the idea. The Tobin tax will bring some transparency to a very obscure question. ""The more progress is made towards trade liberalisation, the more rules are needed"", as Commissioner Lamy said during the Millennium Round in Seattle. He recognised that the combined impact of the single market and the single currency that characterise the process of the European Union's construction is intimately linked to a huge amount of new regulations. Now that financing is readily available across national boundaries without any difficulty the same approach will obviously be strictly necessary, all the more so as we consider that an enormous amount every single day is employed in speculative transactions."	es
Secondly there is a lady within thirteen weeks of retirement who is desperate for news of a decision that will affect seriously her financial circumstances in old age. These are just two examples of real life problems behind delays in Europe' s system of justice. Delays in justice can mean personal difficulties and even tragedy. This is not to say that all of our own national systems of justice are perfect, but all too often they may be waiting for a preliminary ruling from the European Court. Amongst the statistics there is a worrying upward trend in the time taken to deal with preliminary references. This should not be taken as a criticism of the Court or of its staff, rather of the Court' s structure and its lack of resources in a growing European Union. The proposals in this report are very welcome as an interim palliative, but Europe is a legal construction, its courts are central to its proper functioning. In the face of coming enlargement the IGC must deal with fundamental reform and restructuring of the court system. Otherwise we will all, as elected representatives, be faced with more and more clamour from our citizens who are not getting access to quick and effective justice. Mr President, I too would like to thank the rapporteur for this excellent report. I also fully endorse his findings, in which, in particular, he suggests increasing the number of consultants for judges at the Court of First Instance and providing the latter with its own translation service. In point of fact, I consider this to be necessary because we heard, following the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market' s visit to Luxembourg, that it is of course inevitable, a God-given fact as it were, that the Court of Justice should take precedence over the Court of First Instance when it comes to using the joint translation service, and so more often than not, important cases handled by the Court of First Instance cannot be given the attention they deserve. However I also believe that the reforms must go further than those we are to adopt here. For example, I believe it is worth considering making the Court of First Instance that of Last Instance, if applicable, and making this a final competence, in those spheres where benches of the Court, which resemble courts, pass judgement at a preliminary stage - I need only mention the keyword Alicante or whatever the plans are for European civil service law. I am also aware that we are probably also going to have to do something about the European Commission' s inclination to renationalise competition decisions and transfer them back to national level. It seems to me that we need to give this some thought, as these cases will no longer fall to the Court of First Instance of course but to the Court of Justice as draft decisions. We need to consider how we will deal with situations of this kind. Where possible, one should also have the opportunity to present draft decisions in competition cases to the specialist chamber within the Court of First Instance.	es
"I look to the Portuguese Presidency in particular to build on some of the tremendous work which was done by the Finnish Presidency in bringing forward coordinated plans and action between the Member States. We already have, on the international side, plans in place to combat drug trafficking, money laundering and so on. But to bring it down to a more human level: to give assistance to those people who are trying to come off drugs, and give them proper controls and proper mechanisms for rehabilitation; secondly, to coordinate amongst the police forces and the judiciary with regard to common penalties and common laws; thirdly, to undertake an information and awareness campaign for young people; and once and for all to put an end to these very dangerous words of ""normalisation"" and ""harm reduction"" and show that any weakening of our resolve in making sure that drugs are not legalised must be for the good of all our people. Mr President, I would like to use the few seconds of speaking time to which I am entitled to point out, or remind, the representative of the Commission that, in Belgium, the government is currently pursuing a policy under which thousands and possibly tens of thousands of illegal aliens are being legalised and are to receive permanent right of residence, right to be reunited with their families, etc. This is a Belgian government measure which flies in the face of the Schengen Treaty. I lodged a written complaint on the same subject to Commissioner Vitorino on 23 December. I would ask him to take this complaint into consideration and inform me, within the foreseeable future, of the steps the Commission will take to penalise this violation of the Schengen Treaty by the Belgian State, in accordance with Article 226 of the Treaty. Mr President, esteemed gentlemen from Portugal, especially the Council representatives, you face great expectations on our part. I should like to give you an example of one way in which you can meet these expectations relatively quickly in at least one small segment. I refer to Eurodac. You will remember that we decided with great expectations here in the European Parliament in December that Eurodac would become a reality as a regulation and as a system, as a Community instrument which we urgently need in order to prevent multiple asylum applications, in order to have an instrument to fight illegality and, above all, in order to set out clearly which Member State was responsible for implementing the asylum procedure. We voted clearly in favour of the introduction of this instrument, together with an implementation committee, which would be attached to the Commission in just the same way that a corresponding database would be. We were of the opinion that EURODAC was becoming a reality. Even in Tampere, we were of the opinion that Eurodac was becoming a reality. However, the Council then took another direction at the very next summit in December and took a huge step backwards by deciding what we had absolutely rejected, i.e. that the Council should continue to be responsible for implementation, that the regulatory committee would be attached to the Council and that, where possible, Gibraltar would still be used to exert pressure."	fr
In this respect, the issue requires closer examination, because the sensitive situation in the Caucasus region could heighten people' s suspicions. My second point concerns the safety of these plants. In areas of high seismic risk, it is not enough just to have secure, earthquake-proof buildings. Speaking as an engineer, I can tell you that we carry out tests to investigate the effects of certain risk factors in extreme circumstances. However, we cannot carry out tests on nuclear plants which are in operation; it is just not possible. With this in mind, it goes without saying that nuclear plants a priori should not be built in areas prone to earthquakes. In this respect, and because Turkey is situated on the periphery of the European Union, we should be helping it to become a more secure, peaceful and cooperative country. That is our role and this is the point of my question. I recognise the relevance of the arguments that Mr Souladakis has put forward. This is, of course, a highly sensitive issue. Furthermore, it will be evident that this is a matter that does not only affect Turkey, in view of that country' s proximity to the existing territory of the European Union. It also affects other states neighbouring the EU with which we maintain relations. We understand your concerns and will certainly take account of them, particularly during the discussions that we will be having with Turkey to define that country' s own pre-accession strategy agenda. This question will naturally be one of our key concerns, and the European Commission will not fail to take this into account. Thank you, Mr President and thank you President-in-Office of the Council. I am sure the President-in-Office of the Council is a very nice man and is very kind to his wife and his children and his dog. However, forgive me if I am a little sceptical of the reply you have just given me. I do not believe that the statements made within the Council and the votes are available to the public immediately. Will you please therefore undertake, before the next plenary in February, to write and tell me where I can find this information on behalf of the public, immediately the Council has passed legislation, rather than waiting for it to come out weeks later on a press release list. Will you write to me before the next plenary with that information? Mr Newton Dunn, I would first like to say that I do not appreciate the kind of personal comments with which you started your second question, and I would be grateful if you could refrain from making such comments in future. With regard to what you were saying, it makes me think that the criticism levelled at the Council, apart from being formulated in a very specific way of which we also take note, does not actually refer to the opacity, shall we say, of the legislative process, but rather almost to an excess of transparency. However, I would like to say, Mr Newton Dunn, that the results of this kind of process for transparency are quite obvious to us and we consider them to be unquestionable.	es
Since 1998, the Commission has received a number of complaints alleging that the harbour will damage the mudflats at Stegrennan, which are now designated a part of the special protection area, and that the relevant protection criteria have not been observed. After investigating these complaints between 1998 and the beginning of 1999 - during which time the project did not receive support from the Structural Funds - the Commission became convinced, in the summer of 1999, that the relevant protection criteria had been observed during the building of the harbour. An in-depth environmental impact assessment had been carried out. The most serious harm caused by the project, the damage to the Stegrennan mudflats, was only to be temporary, and the developers were liable for completely restoring the mudflats. At the Commission's suggestion, the mudflats at Stegrennan were formally included in the Boyne Estuary special protection area, from which they had previously been excluded. Furthermore, to compensate for the negative effects on the bird populations caused by the temporary disappearance of the mudflats, the intention was that other habitats in the estuary should be improved. However, since last summer the measure just mentioned has been in dispute. Firstly, the Irish authorities withdrew their earlier commitment to carry out improvements. They then renewed their commitment after an Irish non-governmental organisation began a legal challenge in the Irish courts. However, the new commitment included some minor changes which, in turn, led to a further complaint. In view of the fact that the Irish authorities have undertaken to make compensatory improvements and that other issues have already been resolved, the Commission will not, for the present, propose that financial support from the Structural Funds should be suspended. However, it wishes to discuss the question of compensatory measures with respect to improved habitats with the Irish authorities, particularly in the light of the continuing legal challenge in the Irish courts. - I do not quite understand what the Commissioner said. The mudflat at Stregrennan, which was made a special protection area at the request of the Commission, has been completely destroyed at this stage. It is clear that the activities that have taken place there are in clear breach of EU directives. You say there will be no further funding. I would like to know whether you are going to stop completely the funding at this stage until there is a proper investigation. If not, why not? If you are, when exactly are you going to do it? Is it correct and proper that the department which owns the company is also the authority which issues the licence, and also the authority which basically takes the money from the EU and gives it to a company that it owns 100%? Is this right and proper? What is your opinion on that? Any EU funding for the project must be stopped because it is in clear breach of EU directives. Even the area designated by the Commissioners as a special protection area has been destroyed. Compensation afterwards is not going to make up for the damage that was done.	es
Unfortunately, nothing is changing and nothing is going to change. You intend to pour oil on the fire and apply the same ill-advised methods and the same economic principles to areas which have, until now, escaped your grasp: education, wage policy, direct taxation, employment law, social protection, social assistance. The most extraordinary thing in all this is that this socially regressive policy has in the main been implemented by left wing governments of varying hues - pink, red, green - who advocate social justice during electoral campaigns, but orchestrate widespread social decline once in power. I must at this point stress our conviction that there can be no social policy nor full employment policy without national and European preferences, and without protecting our markets from fierce international competition. It is our obligation to put Europeans first when it comes to employment, social protection, policies relating to the family, and retirement policy. Your globalisation of the economy is neither necessary nor inevitable. This globalisation has been forcibly imposed by the only superpower to have survived the cold war and by multinational companies which are becoming economic superpowers in their own right and who can subjugate to their economic will states, nations and peoples who are quite unable to protect themselves. You are thus acting as accomplices in this process. You are facilitating it, collaborating with it, and are in fact orchestrating, despite your declared intentions, the disintegration of our social welfare systems, precariousness, and social decline. The European social model runs the risk of not being able to cater for this globalisation of the economy, especially in its current form which operates with no regard for specific social issues nor the specific national characteristics of individual States. Your ultra-liberal headlong rush is thus surely not the solution to social problems, precariousness or employment problems faced by tens of millions of European citizens. Mr President, the Lisbon Summit will produce a further string of fine words to dazzle us with. The words will be welcome, but the basic problem is that we have an Economic and Monetary Union which attaches more importance to fighting inflation than to promoting employment. The Central Bank has said that price rises should always be kept below 2%. The Stability Pact says that the budget deficit must be no more than 1% in ordinary years. There is no requirement that unemployment should be below 5% or - better still - below 2 or 1%. It is public consumption and the price of money which definitely must not rise. You might think that a country would wish to limit unemployment by means of public investment, but that is prohibited. It is more important to stick to the holy cow of monetary policy than to find jobs for the unemployed. I, on the other hand, think it is more important to take account of families' finances and to ensure that dad comes home with a wage packet instead of a redundancy notice. So too did the Danish Government which came to power in 1993. In 1992 we had 9.2% unemployment, both in Denmark and in the eleven countries of the good old EU. Between 1992 and 1998, unemployment in Denmark fell to 5.1%. In the EU, it increased to 10.9%.	de
I will give you one example of this. In the 1998 Court of Auditors report an exchange rate miscalculation in relation to Italian wine cost the taxpayers of Europe GBP 8 to 10 million. It is clear that is not acceptable. What happened to the person who was responsible for that miscalculation? We need a system which provides incentives and promotion and we need to see this promotion based on merit. We recognise that most of the officials within the Commission are extremely hard-working. But we also recognise that some of the practices are outdated. We look forward to reading the full Commission proposal on reform and we look forward to working out the detail alongside the Commission because, unlike what Mr Elles has just said, the Commissioner has made a commitment to discuss it with Parliament between now and 1 March. We also need to recognise that people who live in glasshouses should not throw stones. The European Parliament has not exactly been clean in its approach to things throughout its history. We have a long way to go before we are perfect ourselves. Our own staff policy is outdated. Some of our working practices need radical reform. I hope that the European Parliament will be hanging onto the coattails of the Commission in this reform process. We recognise the proposals on activity-based budgeting. We recognise that means discipline on the part of Commission officials and we recognise also that we have a responsibility within Parliament on discipline when we talk about negative priorities. Finally, can I say that the Commission needs to work on its relationships with the public. European taxpayers need to be re-assured. The fate of the Commission, of the whole European Union, rests on delivery of this reform. That is the key issue, delivery of these proposals. Mr President, I would like to start by extending my compliments to the rapporteur, Mr van Hulten, on his first report. I very much admire him for keeping his spirits up at a time when he was inundated with so many amendments. I think that the report drawn up by the Wise Men has been useful and I think that it is also useful for this Parliament - as already stated by Mrs Morgan - that we ourselves should ask for expertise from outside for once to see how our administration is run. We have submitted an amendment to this effect. From the many points made by Mr van Hulten in his report, I would like to highlight a few, not necessarily in order of importance but just randomly. Firstly, I think that the Commission should pay much more attention to the proper storage of documents. The Commission' s records leave a great deal to be desired. We noticed this when we had to investigate the Flechard affair, which, as it happens, has still not been sorted out. Curiously, very important documents had gone missing from the cabinets, even from those of the President and of various Directorates-General, and this is clearly something which should not happen.	fr
Finally, I support the European Commission' s intent to formulate an ambitious European poverty standard and to drastically reduce poverty within a ten-year period. I think it is important to formulate an objective in this respect, Mr President-in-Office, that is to say to challenge all Member States to stamp out social exclusion of all citizens in our society, not only children, but also their parents and the elderly. I wish the President-in-Office all the best in the pursuit of his ambitions. Mr President, Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, the Special European Council in Lisbon on employment, economic reform and social cohesion is to pursue, as you have told us, an objective which is ambitious, very ambitious, at the risk of disappointing our fellow citizens, conscious as they are that decreeing full employment and the eradication of poverty in Europe cannot, in itself, ensure that this objective is attained. But, when all is said and done, this summit will have a major benefit - that of outlining, in the wake of Cardiff and Luxembourg, a political desire for greater social cohesion, particularly as regards the 57 million people who are living in a state of poverty within the Union, including single mothers, large families and children, and whose numbers will in the future be swelled by other outcasts from society, specifically those people who will not have access to new areas of knowledge, since this will engender new social imbalances. It would thus be appropriate to implement an economic and social policy which is firmly geared towards the future, in order to prevent the emergence of a digital gulf between the 'info-rich' and the 'info-poor' , which is to say, as one speaker has just put it, a digital divide. It is for this reason that, while I feel that new technologies constitute a tremendous vector for socially-inclusive growth, they will only be so if they are taught from an early age, in that by 2010 fifty per cent of all jobs will be in sectors directly linked to information technologies. I recommend that Lisbon Summit take three decisions in this regard: firstly, on a strategy for lifelong learning, with the establishing of an agenda for eradicating child poverty, both financial and intellectual impoverishment; secondly, on preparing European society for the European research area; thirdly, on implementing a working methodology and coordination procedure which is open and based on our social and economic policies, and is accompanied by concerted assessment of our national plans. Mr President, there is an idea in the Portuguese Presidency's statement which I like very much. This idea is the notion that the strength of our European economy is rooted in the capabilities, imagination and creativity - quite simply in the knowledge - of the people in the European economic process. If we are to take this seriously, however, if the intention is for this really to become a political programme, then no additional justification is required for a policy of social inclusion, because participation in society would in itself be the strongest productive force in our shared economy. If that is the case, Mr President-in-Office, then we urgently need common objectives. We need firm targets, the attainment of which it is possible to measure, in terms of both quality and quantity, for increasing employment rates, as for example was also recently proposed by the Commission.	it
"I do not think there is any difference between us and the Ombudsman. There is a question about the legislative base on which we have taken the best advice and I think we are soundly placed on that. I want to repeat that honourable Members, like the honourable Member who asked the question, who take a particular interest in this issue, will want to have a dialogue about it. It is extremely important and I recognise the concern of the honourable Member. I want to thank the Commission for what I perceive as a very positive answer. For safety' s sake, I should like to have confirmation that it really is the case that, where the Commission and good administration are concerned, there is no part of Jacob Söderman' s proposal which the Commission thinks is unacceptable. Is it true that the contents of all parts of the proposal will be approved? Let me read what it says in my brief - and as it is in my brief it must be true! ""I would like to stress again that the Commission has accepted all the Ombudsman's recommendations contained in his draft recommendations of July 1999"". Both documents, that is the Commission's document and the Ombudsman's draft, cover largely the same ground. The only substantial question that has arisen is the legislative basis. I can go into that in detail if the honourable Member would like but there is no doubt that we are on all fours with the Ombudsman on this important issue. We will be happy to incorporate Mr Patten' s notes into the bibliography, as another bedside book for the Members to bear in mind. As the author is not present, Question No 32 lapses. I apologise to Mr Vitorino for this parliamentary discourtesy. I am sorry. According to the Rules of Procedure, you are not required to reply. I wish you a good evening. Second Part Questions to Mr Nielson, who is replaced by Mr Patten Questions 33 and 34 of Questions to the Commission were intended for Mr Nielson. Mr Nielson cannot be present today since he is in South Africa. I must tell you that the Vice-President of the Commission, Mrs Loyola de Palacio, has sent me a kind letter giving me all sorts of explanations and informing me that Mr Patten will reply to the questions. Question No 33 by (H-0829/99): Subject: 'Mainstreaming' in EU aid policy In 1995 the Council drew up guidelines for integrating the equal opportunities dimension ('mainstreaming') into the full range of EU aid policy. The guidelines call for all staff working in the development sector to receive continuous training in 'gender mainstreaming' but in recent years only around 50 people have been trained and there is still no compulsory training in the subject within the Directorate-General for Development. 'Mainstreaming' means taking account of equality between women and men as an integral part of all forms of development policy, strategy and measures. To achieve that, the Council's guidelines must be implemented in their entirety."	es
This is the hub of the administration which has to ensure efficiency and security. We are going to create a management and control system in every Directorate-General. At the moment, our control system is completely centralised; with the reform we will switch to a control system which combines decentralisation of management control with an efficient central audit system. This means that we will have a central financial service to provide financial management guidance and advice, decentralisation in every Directorate-General of the entire chain, that is of programmes, undertakings, contracts, expenditure and the related ex ante control systems, and an external auditing service which will direct these operations. This is a complete revolution of the Commission' s way of working; it is a totally different method of organisation and it will require a totally different way of thinking. We are familiar with the problems associated with this transitional stage, and it is this transition which has caused the greatest concern among our staff: we will therefore adopt the necessary security measures and put the necessary safeguards in place. In fact, the Commission desires this reform in order to become a model of excellence for the whole of Europe and the world. We also want to be exemplary in our advanced use of information technology. We want to be a model of a completely computerised administration. The Commission has been accused of being buried under piles of paper, and so we are going to become a paperless Commission. This will make the Commission itself more efficient and encourage the use of new technologies outside the Commission. This is not just a technical revolution, but a complete organisational revolution as well. I shall leave to Neil Kinnock the task of explaining the details of the reform, but I would first like to thank him for the intelligence, enthusiasm and energy he has brought to this exercise. We would both like to thank all those who have worked on the project and all the Commission staff, who took part in the broadest debate ever organised at the Commission. I would stress that this style of debate is something very new and, in my opinion, it has forced us to radically change our way of thinking as well. The White Paper before us is also the product of contributions from the Commission staff: they knew that the Commission would have to undergo substantial reform in order to become, once again, that internationally-admired institution which was at the heart of European history. The adoption of the White Paper marks the end of a chapter of history - and I hope that it will remain closed forever. Now we can focus on the future, on the challenges awaiting the Union and on the programme for 2000-2005, the contents of which we have outlined to you over the past few weeks. The very political essence of the reform is mirrored in the objectives of this five-year plan. We need - the whole Union needs - a strong Commission, a Commission which has regained its ability to act as a political entity and is recognisable as such in all its actions. This is why we are redefining all our work priorities. This is why we are offloading all the activities which it is no longer appropriate for us to carry out - another important area of reform - in accordance with a principle of decentralisation and subsidiarity.	de
As you know, at the 55th session of the Human Rights Commission held last year, the United States decided, at a very late stage, to table a draft resolution on China. This draft resolution was defeated by a Chinese no-action motion. The European Union voted against that motion. The European Union' s position on the approach to be adopted towards China in the Human Rights Commission was confirmed at the General Affairs Council on 21 March 1999: there was no European Union initiative on China nor was agreement reached to co-sponsor a resolution on China, but an EU vote against the no-action motion. It is by no means certain that the European Union could have maintained a united front if this resolution had been put to the vote. The United States of America will be tabling a draft resolution on China at the 56th session of the Human Rights Commission and are putting pressure on the European Union to support this draft resolution. This initiative has provoked a strong reaction on China' s part: the Chinese authorities are making representations to the countries and institutions of the European Union, in an attempt to persuade them not to support the United States' initiative. This initiative is being discussed within the Union, but with no hope of a decision in the near future. It is in the interests of the European Union to keep all its options open for as long as possible, and in any case at least until after the EU-China human rights dialogue meeting is held on 25 February 2000. In view of changes made to the membership of the Human Rights Commission, we estimate the vote on the no-action motion will be close. It is therefore important this year, too, that the countries of the European Union should reach a consensus on the position to take in any vote on the resolution. In this context it is important to note that the European Union regularly opposes requests by China that the human rights dialogue should automatically rule out tabling a resolution at the Human Rights Commission in Geneva. The European Union unequivocally considers that although it is a very valuable instrument for exchanging views and for taking note of the overall position of the other party, the dialogue should also yield concrete results on the ground, and when this does not happen it may be necessary to present a resolution to the Human Rights Commission, potentially whilst the dialogue is continuing. The European Union also regularly informs China that the Human Rights Commission is the appropriate body for considering human rights issues, and whether or not it agrees with this initiative, this is in any case legitimate from this point of view. The next human rights dialogue will take place on 25 February in Lisbon, and will include seminars on legal issues and on women' s rights, and it is expected that representatives from the academic world and from civil society will take part. The next human rights seminar will be organised by the Portuguese Presidency in May 2000, and, during the last round of the dialogue in October 1999, the Chinese side accepted the European Union' s proposal for technical assistance to support the process of ratifying the United Nations International Pact on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights and the United Nations' International Pact on Civil and Political Rights, both of which have been signed by the Chinese Government.	de
"There is nothing natural about these recurring disasters, they are the result of fate. They are the result of human thoughtlessness. What we have here is an ecological disaster. Only the people cut off from the harsh reality of the grass roots could have any doubt about that. It is also an economic disaster for all the people who make their living from the sea and from tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, shellfish farmers, people who make a living from the salt marshes, shopkeepers, etc. The Erika disaster must be the last in the series. First of all, we must shed some light on this shipwreck. Why do we not appoint a parliamentary committee of inquiry or get Members of Parliament involved in the team of experts which has just been announced by the Commission? Next, as a matter of urgency, we muss pass legislation, firstly, regarding identification of the exact characteristics of goods transported. In fact, according to the experts, the oil the Erika was carrying was supposed to sink to the bottom and should never have reached the coast. We know what actually happened. Next, reliable technical inspection must be established like the technical inspection compulsory in France for vehicles more than five years old. We must regulate the use of flags of convenience, make double hulls mandatory for the transport of polluting or dangerous materials, work on technological innovations in order to be able to process or recover hydrocarbons at sea. This would be a minimum requirement, I believe, on the dawn of the third millennium. Non-compliant vessels must be denied access to European waters, the responsibility of polluters, shipowners or charterers must be determined in line with the principle of the ""polluter pays"" , maritime supervision must be strengthened to prevent any degassing, thorough and reliable inspection of tankers must be required, an appropriate ""natural disasters"" budget line must be re-established for Member States and, in the meantime, Community aid released on an exceptional basis and the French departments affected by the disaster should be made eligible for Structural Funds. I have also tabled a resolution on this subject on behalf of the EDD Group. Mr President, in the course of the last few years there has been a succession of serious tanker disasters world-wide and the countermeasures taken have either been ineffective or not worth mentioning. It is particularly bad this time, not least because it has affected a major European State; an incident which could happen again at any time. We urgently require a directive if we are to reduce these risks. The 15 clearly do not suffice. These guarantee - making no claim to be exhaustive - a minimum of 3 things. No tanker or freighter fit only for the scrap heap must ever put into any harbour within the European Union again. All those involved, including the transport agent, are responsible for any ensuing damage, and these individuals are to provide satisfactory assurances. This is the only way of affording the victims the opportunity to make their claims for compensation. However, we must aim higher in the long-term, let there be no mistake about that. In other words, we need real cost-effectiveness for our entire energy supply system. Mr President, may I start by saying that I would like to thank Commissioner Palacio very much for her clear, adequate and, at the same time, very firm response. Many thanks for this. This also means that, in any case, I have a great deal of respect for the briefing note which she sent on 10 January but also for the action points which she announced today. The Erika disaster shows that when sound traffic and transport regulations are lacking at international and European level, nature and the environment come off second-best."	de
These areas are mutually dependent upon one another. Economic stability is a reason for growth and can provide high employment. It also provides the opportunity to develop welfare provision. But the reverse is also the case: a well-developed policy on social security can contribute to high employment and to increased growth. In other words, social security is a factor of production. Social security systems differ from one EU country to another. This is largely due to historical factors. We are now faced with a number of common challenges, however; demographic development, for example, which has to do not only with the increase in the number of elderly people but also with the lower birth rate. The labour market is also changing. Women are venturing into the labour market in ever greater numbers. Another challenge is presented by technical development. We must meet these challenges together. The Commission' s communication recommends that experience should be more widely shared, a high-level group formed and benchmarking introduced. What is more, the report on social security should be published annually and examined in conjunction with the report on employment. This is good, but it is not enough. We propose a procedure like the Luxembourg process. Clear guidelines and indicators are required. At the same time, the Member States are to formulate the relevant methods in national action plans. We are creating a common model, but retaining the principle of subsidiarity. This social convergence is a process which will continue for a long period. Parliament must therefore be involved in the work - not by being part of the high-level group, but by enabling parliamentary representatives to track the work of the latter and come up with proposals as to how the process is to be carried on. Like the work on employment, the Commission' s proposal is founded upon four pillars. These are: to make the systems employment-friendly; to make the pensions systems sustainable in the long term; to promote social integration; and to guarantee sustainable, high-quality health and medical care. All this is important. In our report, we have highlighted the importance of combating poverty within the EU and of finding indicators as soon as possible so that we can make progress in this area. Equality has no pillar of its own. There, it is mainstreaming which applies. All four pillars should reflect aspects of equality. This is something we have borne in mind. We are submitting a wide range of proposals to the effect, for example, that there should be a transition to individualised social security systems; that parental leave should involve entitlement to benefits under the social security systems; that there should be better opportunities to combine family and working life; and that the basic old-age pension should guarantee a decent standard of living. These proposals favour women especially. Parallel to this European strategy of social convergence, a concrete plan for legislative work in the social sphere is required, together with proposals for framework agreements in the context of the dialogue between employers and employees, accompanied by a concrete timetable.	it
Air routes, ferry routes, train routes, bus routes, within and to these remoter areas are put out to tender. The bidder who offers to provide the specific service at a specific quality level and at the lowest subsidy level gets the contract. Let us call this a negative tender franchise. This permits desirable competition in providing these services under a publicly-supported but fully transparent franchise system. Why could not mail collection and delivery in a certain region be put to negative tender in this manner? The lowest subsidy would win the franchise for a certain period of time. Why could not the sub-post office in a remote village also be put out to this sort of negative tender? It would therefore be up to the appropriate democratically accountable government body, local, regional or national - probably under overall EU supervision - to set the service criteria and the financial resources for meeting this particular social purpose. Otherwise the postal services can be left to all the demands and constraints of the marketplace. Mr President, Commissioner, it is no coincidence that I am the fifth Member of this House from Scotland to rise to speak in this debate. That is a measure of the importance to us of our postal services. Scotland as a country is larger than some Member States. It has many remote mainland communities accessible only by road, sometimes served poorly by public transport, sometimes not at all. Such communities rely for their survival on having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a shop. It is on the last two that the elderly, in particular, depend. Often they are located together, each service being made more viable by the existence of the other. Scotland also has many island communities, some of which can be reached by air but most of which depend on sea ferries. It has been calculated that the actual cost of carrying a letter from Edinburgh to the Central Highlands is about ten times that of carrying the same letter across London. And it is about four times the postage cost actually charged. The more remote the community, the greater the difference becomes. That is the measure of the problem. It is not to oppose liberalisation to ask that it be done in a way that takes account of these factors and allows the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service. It is for all our remote and island communities, no matter where in the European Union they are situated, and not just for the people of Scotland, that I ask you to preserve the vital lifeline that their postal services provide. . Mr President, I consider it a privilege that I am replacing my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high-quality debate on postal services. I will try to respond to the debate on the basis of information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein. May I repeat that on Monday he will be available to the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism of Parliament. Some Members, like Mr Stenmarck, complain that there have been delays with the new proposal.	it
"The time for resolutions has passed. What is now needed is action. Sadly, I fear, the Council will yet again fail to act and we will be back in the future discussing yet another maritime and ecological disaster. Mr President, every time there is a disaster of this kind people say it must never happen again. In reality we can never stop accidents happening at sea, but it is incumbent upon us all to learn the lessons whenever an incident of this kind takes place and apply those lessons to reduce risks in future. The ""Erika"" incident was serious especially for the people of Brittany most closely affected, but it was devastating for the wildlife of much of Europe. Some say that it is the worst accident that has ever befallen the bird life of this part of Europe. The Royal Society for the Protection of Birds believes that as many as 400,000 birds, perhaps mainly guillemots, may have died. The pictures many of us will have seen of oil-soaked birds being put down by veterinary officials were both distressing and tragic. We all want the highest standards for ships whatever flag they may be flying. We need to enforce the regulations and ensure that the ""polluter pays"" principle is applied so that financial penalties and some incentives are used to put pressure on both ship operators and oil companies to ensure that best practice is introduced. I agree with every word the Commissioner said in her remarks, but the question is, how long will it take to ensure that measures are introduced to deal with the problem in the way she proposes? As a politician she needs to remind her officials how difficult it would be were she to have to come back to this Parliament in a year, were a similar incident, just as devastating, to take place, if some of the measures she has proposed today were simply still remaining as fine words and she had not had the chance to put them into practice. The thought of an incident of this kind occurring in the near future should concentrate her mind and the minds of her officials wonderfully. Mr President, Commissioner, I have brought you a small gift. Here is a cake of oil sent by someone living on the French island of Noirmoutier who wrote to me as follows: ""With every tide, the beach is covered with heavy fuel oil which has leaked out of the Erika. With every tide, the volunteers, members of the armed forces and firemen remove great pancakes of this thick, sticky, black tar. When will we see a return to cleanliness and the end of this devastating accident?"" Indeed this disaster involving the Erika, like that of the Russian vessel in Turkey, moreover, is unacceptable and intolerable at a time when the ultimate hi-tech technology is available. It is all the more unacceptable for such a thing to occur twenty years after the Amoco Cadiz disaster, despite our saying at the time and many times since, ""Never again!"""	es
We need firm, joint, realistic targets for reducing the unemployment rate, as for example was also recently proposed by the Commission, to 4% in 2010. No longer must it be acceptable for the ECOFIN ministers to allow each other to celebrate consolidation successes at home while responsibility for the massive unemployment in Europe remains shrouded in mystery. I wish you much strength, pledge Parliament's support and assure you that this Parliament will have more to say on the issues of economic and employment policy in the future, as the people of Europe also expect. That would give you another ally for your policy. Mr President-in-Office of the Council, Mr President of the Commission, it is gratifying and encouraging to hear this House speak of a new strategic objective for the next decade. This objective consists of creating a European Union which, on the world stage, forms a more dynamic and competitive economic and social area, based on new technologies, innovation and knowledge, so that we are capable of increasing levels of economic growth, with more, and better, jobs and greater social cohesion. It is clear that we must redefine the role of Europe in the world economy, creating a competitive Europe, opening the way to new and better jobs and organising this process with an appropriate strategy for social cohesion. The central role of employment and social policy, in the creation of this new society, is based on two factors. On the one hand we have economic efficiency, since, in this new technological context, the quality of human resources is essential. On the other hand, we have social equality, because, despite the economic upturn which we are witnessing, we still have an enormous degree of social inequality. Unemployment, social exclusion and the danger of future imbalance in the social security systems, are problems which are exacerbated by the unavoidable challenges of globalisation, an ageing population, technological changes, demographic slowdown and the increasing incorporation of women in the workplace. Europe needs to achieve full employment. This full employment should be adapted to the society taking shape, with greater possibilities for its men and women. European citizens must believe in this project and this state of affairs. They must not see it as something abstract which we only speak about in Brussels or Strasbourg. We are asking right now for a transition to a new society, to an economy based on innovation, and on the information and knowledge-based society. We must learn quickly, create new practices more suited to the new society and invest in technological change, but we must never forget the people or the institutions. Lisbon will be a step forward and we must achieve a renewal of the European social model because that is the only way we can achieve greater employment and, at the same time, greater social cohesion. To this end, we must concentrate on a series of priority issues. We must improve the effectiveness of active employment policies. We must strengthen the synergies between adaptability, education and lifelong training. We must increase employment in the sector consisting of services which facilitate business initiative and reduce the administrative burden on small- and medium-sized enterprises, reducing non-wage costs. Lastly, we have to promote the integration of general equal opportunities policies for all men and women, with particular stress on aspects which help to reconcile professional life with family life.	it
When Mr Solana last spoke to this Parliament I was highly critical of the fact that he hardly mentioned at all the idea of conflict prevention; and today we have him mentioning quite a lot about conflict prevention, but no proposal whatsoever about taking it on board on a serious way. We have a lot of proud talk about 60 000 troops being prepared in 60 days to be available for a whole year, but we currently have crises in Europe and on the borders of Europe and elsewhere which this Union is failing abjectly to deal with. What we need are 60 000 civilian policemen and women in order to try and deal with these situations. We have not heard any information from Mr Solana about what leverage is going to be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya. We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about what diplomatic intervention he or the European Union is making in a serious way - serious diplomatic interventions - to stop the slaughter in Chechnya. We have large gaps in what we are arguing for, in principle, in relation to human rights. We mustered the capacity to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and we are now making a complete mess of Kosovo by failing to put adequate resources and staff and people in there to deal with a situation and demonstrating our inability to deal significantly with conflict prevention. So, I would ask Mr Solana to explain to this House the position of the European Union in relation to Chechnya. What are we going to do seriously to bring that appalling situation to an end? We have levers we can use with Russia if we choose to use them, but we are choosing not to use them. Mr President, High Representative, Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana. How, with credibility, are you going to be able to continue promoting closer cooperation on defence and military issues if the Member States are not prepared to comply with common commitments? Meetings are all very well, but it is the result that counts. I also wonder what kind of plans you have to induce governments to ensure that a force of 60 000 troops becomes a reality and not merely figures on a piece of paper. If we look around, the reality is that the CFSP is in danger of becoming nothing more than talk. Take, for example, Germany' s defence savings. These are not only of concern to the defence minister, Mr Scharping. Instead, they also affect the whole of Europe. In my own country, Sweden, the objective, and the commitment towards playing our part, is to supply 2 500 men for EU operations. In the present situation, the national defence can only supply approximately 1 500 men, due to reduced defence spending. If we translate this number into figures for the EU countries as a whole, which is not an unreasonable thing to do if no review is to take place, we shall not have 60 000 men but, at best, 35 000 to 40 000 by the year 2003. My second question concerns the following matter. Some weeks ago, you were evidently misquoted in the German-speaking media, whereupon your press service put out a statement correcting matters. I should like, however, to know the background to this, namely whether, as High Representative, you have been toying at all with the idea of giving Austria special treatment in the context of your assignment and, if so, on whose mandate and with how much leeway.	it
As you will know, the aim of these objectives is to cut poverty by 50% by 2015, by increasing compulsory schooling, by significantly reducing child mortality rates, and by implementing a raft of social welfare measures with a view to effectively achieving this objective. This would mean moving away from the situation of extreme poverty in which more than a third of the world' s population lives, and moving away from the extremely poor living conditions suffered by over a billion people. This is an extraordinary state of affairs, which certainly means that if this objective is to be achieved the international community as a whole will have to participate and intervene actively. And that brings me to the fourth aspect of this new development model that I would like to emphasise. Particularly in recent years, development policies have been regarded as an increasingly global matter, and yet there is apparently a lack of strong international leadership. The concerted actions of the United Nations institutions have played an important role here, as has the Bretton Woods system. I have in mind, in particular, the important impetus given to this debate by the World Bank, especially through its Comprehensive Framework document, and by the International Monetary Fund, where, for the first time, an institution of this kind has put the problem of reducing poverty at the centre of its policy guidelines and has forged a hitherto unimaginable link, for a body of this type, between debt relief and poverty. This new role for international organisations on development issues is also a good reason for us to consider the role of the European Union in this context. The Portuguese Presidency has highlighted the need for the European Union to combine its highly important international role as the main donor with a leading role - and a more active one - in this movement to reform international development policies, and to create greater scope for coordination, in particular with the United Nations system and the Bretton Woods system. If we are to strengthen the European Union' s role in international development policies, we believe that it is basically necessary to take three kinds of action. Firstly, we need to make the EU' s development policy more effective. As you know, an exercise was carried out in 1995 involving an overall assessment of development policies, and the results of this overall assessment exercise were presented during the German Presidency. The main conclusions emphasised the need for a more coherent EU policy and a more strategic overall EU approach to development issues. The key aspects were the need for greater coordination and greater complementarity between policies, the need for harmonisation and simplification of the present organisational framework for the Union' s present cooperation policies, the need to make the EU' s aid management more efficient and, in particular, to review its mechanisms for intervention, and also the need to reinforce the assessment system and to introduce greater transparency into the process for granting aid. A second aspect worth highlighting underscores the need for EU policy and the policies of the Member States to complement each other more.	fr
The reason she cannot do so is because, as some honourable Members have pointed out, she is in Hungary and Romania to see for herself the extent of the damage and how best we can help the Hungarian and Romanian authorities to tackle the crisis. We stand ready to do so. We contacted the Romanian Government and the International Commission for the Protection of the Danube River about the accident earlier this month to seek more information urgently. The Romanians have approached UNEF and OCHA, in Geneva, for an assessment of the damage in the Danube catchment area by an independent and international team of experts. We stand ready to assist in this assessment if there is a joint request from Hungary and Romania and if access to the sites for nationals of both countries can be guaranteed. That is obviously crucial. It is plainly essential to establish as rapidly as possible an accurate picture of the scope of the damage so that we can decide exactly how best to help tackle it. It is to that end that our efforts are now engaged. There is also a need to clarify the legal responsibilities of the mining company and of the Romanian authorities. This is an important point, as several speakers have suggested. The polluter-pays principle is a cornerstone of European Union environmental policy. It is mirrored in the International Convention for the Protection and Sustainable Use of the Danube River and it should be applied in this case. The European Union could not substitute itself for the mining company for any compensation payments due. The Union has mobilised some EUR 20 million over the past seven years to support protection of the Danube River basin. In the context of pre-accession aid to the region it may be possible to redirect some of the assistance we are giving under ISPAR and PHARE to tackle the most severe impact of this accident, as long as the polluter-pays principle is fully respected. We will want, in the longer term, to see what lessons can be drawn from this disaster, above all to see how to prevent such disasters happening in the first place. The incident reinforces the case for a strengthening of European civil protection, along the lines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as suggested by one or two Members today. But for now the priority is to cope with this crisis. As I have said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is on the spot today. She will want to keep Parliament closely in touch with the action she proposes as a result of her visit. This has been an appalling tragedy for Europe and Europe has to respond and do all it can to ensure that incidents as dreadful as this do not continue to blight our future. The debate is closed. We shall now proceed to the vote. VOTE . (FR) The only reason we voted for the PSE-Verts/ALE-GUE/NGL compromise motion for a resolution is because this resolution allowed us to condemn the decision by the Goodyear-Dunlop management to close its factory in Italy.	fr
Over recent years the Community has spent some EUR 200 million in mine clearance, assistance to victims and related activities. The Member States have spent similar amounts. But there is still enormous inefficiency and a lack of will to implement a strategy agreed with other members of the international community to overcome the anti-personnel landmine problem within a finite time span. Mr Nielson identified the problems of lack of concerted action and the need for better complementarity with Member States. This has been talked about for years. The Commission needs to carry out internal organisational changes, strengthen the coherence and effectiveness of its actions, ideally with a properly resourced central mine action policy cell. It would also need more rapid contractual and implementation procedures and an enhanced multiannual budget line and much improved management of its programmes. A proper stock-taking of the effectiveness of mine action programmes needs to take place in each of the countries seriously afflicted by landmines. It seems to me that the landmine issue encapsulates so many of the organisational, procedural, financial management and operational difficulties which have afflicted the Commission and the Union. Are these afflictions of the past, or will we find that in this relatively compact and limited area the European Union is still unable to meet its aspirations? Mr President, Commissioner Nielson, the conclusion of the new ACP-EU Convention is an important step towards greater coherence. And it is to be welcomed that criteria such as human rights, democracy, rule of law, and good governance are more firmly anchored in this new treaty than they were previously, and that earlier colonial relations no longer shape most of our relations to quite the same extent, rather, we now set greater store by these political criteria in this respect. For these are prerequisite to any development. If these criteria are not adhered to, then development does not stand a chance The same goes for Cuba, Mr Modrow. I welcome the fact that Cuba is getting closer to joining this process. But for this to happen, there are also going to have to be a few changes in Cuba. After all, we are all familiar with the reports from Amnesty International. It may well be that you, having belonged to one of the last Communist dictatorships, view the situation somewhat differently to the majority of people in this Chamber, and that you have problems where good governance is concerned. Nonetheless, these are important criteria for the European Union. There is a second issue I would like to raise. We are discussing coherence here. Many speakers have cited examples of the extent to which the various policies are not coherent. In my view, however, the development policy itself needs to be more coherent too. There is no coherence because there is still no effective coordination with the Member States and there are some projects being carried out by the Member States and the European Union in the developing countries which are very much at odds with one another. Nor is there coherence vis-à-vis the European taxpayer when we draft a development policy which is accommodated in the Union' s budget but the EDF remains outside it.	it
I conclude, Mr President, by affirming that this progress is indeed difficult, fragile, and uncertain and it calls for constant vigilance on our part during the various stages of close and precise inspection that have long been advocated. Mr President, Commissioner, I rise to express the warmth and optimism with which the Group of the European Liberal, Democrat and Reform Party welcomes the start of negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. We are extremely hopeful that, along the lines set out by the rapporteur, Mr Swoboda, this agreement can represent an example to be rapidly extended to the other countries, especially Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro and Kosovo and, as soon as possible, Serbia. We are convinced a rapid start to these negotiations and their speedy conclusion is the only way to achieve peace in the region - peace which did not automatically come with the end of the Kosovo war - thus avoiding the recurrence of further disintegration and a return to chaos and violence, with all the consequences of that in terms of continental, if not world, instability. If the maintenance of peace and security is the basic motivation of the current courageous process of enlargement of the Union to the countries of Eastern Europe, that motivation must be present even more strongly in relations with Albania and the countries of former Yugoslavia. And that means decisively pursuing the kind of parallel enlargement to south-east Europe that the agreements we are discussing represent. It is in that quasi-provocative spirit that we have presented an amendment suggesting the transfer of responsibility for south-east Europe from Foreign Affairs to Enlargement. Very rapid and direct involvement of south-east Europe in the life of the European institutions has also led us to suggest that a limited number of observers invited from the national parliaments should be accepted into the European Parliament, and that staff from those countries could work in the Court of Justice and the Commission. But if the development in the region of a more democratic society and largely market-based economy is to be encouraged, we are convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the struggle against corruption and to make international aid more effective for reconstruction and development. With this in mind, we have presented some amendments which I hope Parliament will accept. First, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be offered a customs tariff equal to zero for their exports to the European Union and compensation for the progressive reduction of customs duties applied by Macedonia to European products, on condition that the principle of joint customs control at the frontiers of Macedonia is accepted. Secondly, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia should be encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually link its currency to the euro as the first step towards the Europeanisation of the whole Macedonian economy, with the additional aim of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system. Thirdly, world aid and assistance coming into the region, and hence into Macedonia as well, should be clearly multilateral, and should not subject the beneficiary country to direct obligations towards the donor country.	fr
These opinions add substance to my question addressed to Mr Solana. Poles only need five words for this: nothing about us without us! What do the current EU Member States intend to do about this fair request submitted by candidate countries? Mr President, I too welcome the presence of the High Representative and his availability to answer Members' questions this time round. On his first appearance in November this was not possible, although this was not Mr Solana' s fault. It should be acknowledged, however, that he noted down and undertook to answer as quickly as possible the questions asked by Members. We should also acknowledge the efforts which Mr Solana is making towards achieving a more effective, visible and coherent Common Foreign and Security Policy for the European Union. In this respect, I agree with the previous speakers about the need to have a comprehensive policy which includes not only military elements but also civilian, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which Mr Solana referred. The Portuguese presidency has made great progress in establishing a series of provisional or interim bodies. In record time it has organised this Informal Meeting of Defence Ministers and has highlighted a whole series of milestones on the long road towards this Common Foreign and Security Policy. One of these milestones was the meeting in Sintra which I would like to ask Mr Solana about. This meeting was based on two documents, one being a British document on the Headline Goals and the other a document on the permanent military bodies of the European Union. Mr Solana, would you be prepared, at your next appearance before the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, to explain at length to the committee members the content of these documents discussed at the summit? I should like to ask Mr Patten and, through you, the President-in-Office to also attend and answer the same question. Secondly, to what extent do you support the comments and statements made by the French Defence Minister that the Member States had to allocate 0.7% of GDP to defence expenditure? I would like to hear your opinion. Do you share this view or do you feel a more significant contribution is needed from the Member States in this respect? Thirdly, what assessment would you make of the 'Crisex 2000' exercises which have just ended in which, for the first time, the European Union took part in a series of initiatives with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation? Fourthly and finally, if the Member States asked for this, would you be prepared to chair the Political and Security Committee? In this way you could contribute all your experience as Secretary-General of the Council of Ministers, High Representative for Common Foreign and Security Policy, Secretary-General of the Western European Union and a former Secretary-General of NATO. Mr Solana, as the rapporteur of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defence Policy, I shall limit my speech to those subjects.	es
This means that this proposal' s fundamental aim is not to resolve the problem of the restricted movement of these workers, but merely to improve the position of the companies providing services. On the other hand, for the sake of simplifying procedures some highly debatable amendments have been included in the Berger report, one example of which is the establishment of a common information service for cards issued by a body in any Member State. Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger Report (A5-0012/2000) It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives intended to facilitate the freedom of movement of workers who are nationals of a third country while facilitating the freedom of movement of services. Basically, these proposals introduce the EU service provision card which will in future enable almost 5 million third country nationals legally resident in a European Union Member State to provide services in other Member States, a phenomenon currently obstructed by problems such as the need to obtain visas and work permits. The first proposal for a directive will authorise businesses established in a Member State which employ workers who are third country nationals to assign such employees to another Member State on a temporary basis to provide services there. According to the terms of the directive, the employer would be simply required to request a service provision card for each employee concerned. Logically, in order to be given such a card, the employee must be legally resident in a Member States and must be covered by a social security scheme. The second proposal grants the same rights to self-employed workers who are third country nationals. While, basically, I subscribe to the European Commission proposals, nonetheless there are some conditions which may lead to confusion. That is why I am voting in favour of the amendments tabled by the rapporteur. This will make it possible to clarify the terms and thus prevent any misreading! Other amendments are intended to simplify the administrative procedures, for example by authorising Member States to designate a single authority responsible for issuing cards. I feel an amendment of this type is essential to prevent the sort of administrative unwieldiness which too often acts as a brake on the proper application of new conditions. I can, therefore, only be delighted at the adoption of these directives thus amended. We could not really tolerate much longer a situation in which people legally resident within the European Union had to face so many problems. This goes against the fundamental principle of non-discrimination enshrined in the founding treaties of this Union. Marinho Report (A5-0003/2000): We have serious reservations about the Council' s proposed amendments. How can we talk of increasing the sphere of competence of the Court of First Instance when we know that we need to increase the number of judges in that Court because it is overstretched? The first measure would in fact cancel out the effects of the latter. Some people will say that perfection is not a realistic aim, but a brief look at the background should make our reservations more understandable to them:	it
Social security and protection are among the greatest acquisitions of working people in Europe, and were achieved after many years of battling against the aspirations of big business, and by the constant expression of the solidarity that characterises working people. Today, in the Europe of unemployment and underemployment, it is urgently necessary to establish broader social protection and to extend the rights of working people, but this demands a different system of economic and social development, which the EU cannot possibly create, because of its nature and character. On the basis of these views, we wish to express our categorical opposition to the 'modernisation' of the social protection system that the Commission statement is promoting, and to make it clear that we cannot vote in favour of the report by the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs which is under discussion. That concludes the explanations of vote. (The sitting was suspended at 1.55 p.m. and resumed at 3 p.m.) Next session of UN Human Rights Commission (continuation) The next item is the debate on the Council declaration on the establishing of the EU priorities for the next session of the UN Commission on Human Rights (20 March 2000), including the situation in China. Mr President, I regret the absence of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council. This is a Council declaration, and I believe that it would perhaps have been useful for them to have been present for the rest of the debate. I think it is worth reminding you that the inclusion of this item on the agenda clearly reflects the need, which has been expressed by all the political Groups, for Parliament to hold a debate before the next meeting of the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in Geneva, so that it may express its opinion on such a sensitive issue, one which is so dear to this House. Following the statement of the Presidency-in-Office of the Council and the Commission, I believe we can all agree that the current situation with regard to human rights is far removed from what we would all like to see. At a European Union level we must recognise that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, although the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common instrument in all Member States, not all subsequent protocols have been ratified or signed by all of them. Another clear drawback in this area is the fact that the European Union itself is not a signatory to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the additional disadvantages that this situation entails. I hope that these problems can be tackled and dealt with in the context of the current discussion of the European Union Charter on Fundamental Rights. With regard to foreign affairs, I believe that the majority of points which we have included in the resolution accurately illustrate the real situation and hardly invite optimism, Mr President. Issues such as the abolition of the death penalty, the torture which still goes on in many supposedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the world, demand a clear, visible and effective response from the European Union. In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would like to stress one in particular, that is, the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.	de
"When we hold intergovernmental conferences and consider changes to the Treaty, we must take into account the fact that the EU is developing all the time, sometimes in contravention of the Treaty, as we have just seen. I welcome Commissioner Barnier and the Portuguese Presidency here this afternoon. On 14 February, we will see the launch of the IGC which is to be completed by the end of 2000. This is a big task but it can be done. I think it is generally agreed here this afternoon across all groups that the Helsinki agenda will not be sufficient to cover the necessary reform to prepare Europe for enlargement. In other words we need to go further than what has been referred to as the important ""Amsterdam leftovers"" . These include the extension of qualified voting - in my country we accept that but not to areas of taxation - the re-weighting of voting in Council to favour larger states and the number of Commissioners in an enlarged Europe. In relation to the latter point, Ireland wants to maintain the right to nominate a full and equal Member of the Commission irrespective of the number of Member States joining. We are prepared to consider re-weighting the votes in the Council of Ministers, provided that the larger Member States are willing to agree to every Member State having a full and equal Member of the Commission. I feel I speak for many smaller countries when I make that particular point. At the IGC, we would also need a debate on the possible divisions of the Treaties into two - into a policy area and an area on the Constitution. We would accept the division of the Treaties providing it would not limit the control the smaller Member States had in the re-negotiation of the whole policy area of the Treaty. In other words, if we are not represented fully in the Commission we will not have an input into policy discussions. So we are watching that entire point extremely carefully. We look forward to the Charter of Fundamental Rights and to seeing its contents. The Treaty of Amsterdam, Mr President, has set the number of European Parliament Members at 700 and a debate is needed in this Parliament on how that number will be distributed among the enlarged Europe. Mr President, the Intergovernmental Conference mandate needs to be widened. The most important issue with regard to this is internal differentiation within the Union. It is unfortunate that there has been no serious consideration thus far here in Parliament of the issue of internal differentiation within the Union, which will, however, be necessary if the Union is to enlarge as planned. The Commission' s former president, Jacques Delors, has once again publicly raised the issue of a European Confederation. He has also said that the countries in the vanguard of integration should be able to proceed faster and that they should have their own institutions, for the sake of clarity. The Commission' s current President, Mr Prodi, and the High Representative, Mr Solana, have put forward ideas along the same lines."	es
As far as the Commission is concerned, it is willing to avoid any unjustified bureaucratic overload, but we cannot give up the practice of checking the relevance and quality of the proposed programmes, indeed you would be the first to criticise us if we did. A second observation, the time limits for the submission of programmes and the possibility of submitting a planning supplement in addition to the programmes. I have no objection to the idea of submitting a planning supplement jointly with the main programme. This cannot, however, be grounds for an extension of the original time limit. Let me remind you that the time limit for this programme is six months. This time limit, which indeed is identical to the one we granted for INTERREG and for the Objective 2 DOCUPs, should normally be adequate, I feel, for drawing up a programme, which does not mean that the projects cannot be defined at a later stage. With regard to URBAN, I should like to conclude with a final observation. One of you expressed a wish that these urban issues should not be confined to the URBAN initiative. I agree completely. I myself expressed my concern at the meeting of Ministers for regional and urban planning, a concern to which I devote myself, that in the DOCUPs and the CSFs in the planning which we are currently starting to negotiate, my concern, as I said, that, apart from the URBAN initiative, urban issues should be addressed in all the Objective 1 and Objective 2 programmes, and I believe I can express both our awareness of such issues and also our commitment to include them, beyond the scope of URBAN, in all structural fund programming. But, as for the future, since we must look ahead, I am extremely concerned to see how URBAN is going to be implemented in practical terms, and also to see what our experience will be and what lessons we can learn, because plainly these urban issues are going to be the focus of what may be, for future financial perspectives, a new European regional planning policy. I am not forgetting, and we cannot forget, that 80% of the citizens of Europe today live in towns and that is why this URBAN instrument is extremely important. Let me repeat what I have said, we shall be most attentive to the inclusion of urban issues in all structural fund programming. I should now, Mr President, like to bring up the subject of INTERREG and to thank the rapporteur, Francis Decourrière, in the same way that I thanked Arlene McCarthy, for the quality and relevance of his work. He stressed a number of points, with which we may indicate our agreement, as many of you did too - the importance of this trans-European cooperation, with its three strands, cross-border, transnational, interregional; the added value to the Community provided by INTERREG, its clarity in relation to the general framework of the structural funds, and the truly cross-border and transnational strengthening of eligible programmes and operations; the importance of common structures and what, in discussing another debate which begins today, the Intergovernmental Conference, I termed the common European spirit which we have to strengthen, and here, with INTERREG, thanks to INTERREG, is a way to strengthen common spirit through common structures for the implementation of programmes with real financial solidarity; the importance of partnership in guaranteeing the active participation of all the local and regional authorities concerned as well as private sector associations and economic and social partners.	fr
Finally, on large-scale energy transmission networks, the guidelines also provide for financial participation from the Funds to develop these networks where this helps to reduce dependency on an external supplier or to combat the effects of isolation. This is particularly valid for the region of the Azores which I have just mentioned and also for all most remote regions. It is also valid for certain regions handicapped by their isolation due to mountains, for example. Commissioner, thank you for your answer. However, I asked this question because we are rightly concerned that the report on the third framework programme for research contains a project entitled 'International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor' . This project amounts to several billion ecus and areas eligible for Structural Funds, such as those listed in Objective 1, might welcome this type of installation. We would like to know whether the Commission would be likely to finance this type of project in terms of the installation of this research site rather than directly in the specific 'nuclear research' context. You did not fully answer the last part of my question on large-scale energy transmission networks. Could you please give an answer on this issue? You are concerned about whether the Structural Funds will be used to finance the installation of nuclear plants anywhere. Quite simply there is no question of this. I said that the selection of projects remains the responsibility of the Member States pursuant to the Structural Funds Regulation. As a result, the Commission services are not systematically informed of all projects selected. However, you are right to question me as this is your task, as mine is to answer you. As has happened in the past, the Member States are required to provide answers when the Commission questions them or asks for clarification. I will therefore step beyond the confidence usually shared between Member States and the Commission and I will find out exactly what is happening on this specific point. The Member State or States concerned will then be required to answer me and I will send you this answer as soon as possible. I thought I had answered your question on large-scale energy transmission networks. The energy situation varies widely from region to region in the European Union. Assistance from the Structural Funds could be justified in certain cases and for certain regions, particularly in the case where the connection to basic energy networks is still underdeveloped. This is the only answer I can give you on the link between large-scale energy transmission networks and the Structural Funds. - Question No 46 by (H-0052/00): Subject: Structural Funds and additionality In the light of the Commission's recent helpful response to my priority Written Question about Structural Funds and additionality, I wish to ask whether the Commission has any plans to seek amendment of the rules concerning additionality. In particular, would the Commission look favourably on a change in the rules to ensure that additionality operates not only at the level of Member States but also within Member States, with regard to budgetary provisions between central government and internally autonomous regions or countries?	fr
The labelling of genetically-modified additives is particularly important in this respect. On the one hand, it enables farmers to make an informed decision as to whether or not they wish to use such feedingstuffs and, on the other hand, it enables consumers to avoid foodstuffs produced using GMOs. Finally, our group should like once again to thank the rapporteur, who has gone to a great deal of trouble. I think that we can all hardly wait to hear Mr Byrne' s reply. Mr President, the report deals mainly with formalities, in other words, the manner in which additives will be authorised. It is less concerned with the types of additives and how they work. I should like to take this opportunity to stress how important it is that, in future, all the directives are dealt with under Article 152, since both food safety and environmental issues require a coherent policy and a comprehensive overview. We cannot carry on as we have done up until now, that is to say dealing with each detail on its own, often only after the harm has already been done. The rapporteur places the emphasis on the testing and labelling of GMOs in feed additives. However, I should like once again to raise the issue of antibiotics. Certainly, five of the nine antibiotics that were originally permitted in animal feed have now been banned. It is nevertheless extremely important to ban the remaining four, both in the interests of human health and for the sake of the animals themselves. We now know that resistance to antibiotics poses a very serious threat to people's health, particularly in the case of small children. A number of Member States are already able to show conclusively that improper practices in connection with the keeping of livestock are totally unnecessary. Several countries phased out antibiotics in animal feedingstuffs a long time ago and others are in the process of successfully doing the same. We talk a great deal about the precautionary principle but, in the case of antibiotics, it has long since been forgotten. However, there is another environmental principle at stake, namely the exchange principle. I should like to say a few words about coccidiostats. They are a zootechnical product which is not totally necessary. There is a substitute, which is used to vaccinate chickens. Although it is a little more expensive, it does not harm the environment. Coccidiostats now accompany the manure that is spread on the fields. In that way, they end up in our water supplies which, as we all know, are our most vital resource. Mr President, Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, the report on additives in animal feedingstuffs concerns the technical and economic problem of restoring the competitive balance between different additives in feedingstuffs and between producers of these additives. Yet after the serious dioxin crisis which affected Belgium and other European countries last summer we cannot just view this issue in terms of competition. You may recall, even though this passed virtually unnoticed by the general public, that the Commission' s scientific experts discovered industrial residues of dioxin-loaded chemical lime in the pulp of citrus fruit imported from Brazil.	fr
The opening of a building which was not finished, in the middle of an election campaign, which eight months after the opening can still not be occupied, makes the Spanish Government look ridiculous. I am not worried that the Spanish Government should look foolish, because at the end of the day it was their responsibility, but it does worry me that the Commission should look foolish by endorsing, through its presence, this absurd event. I would therefore like to ask you, Mr Commissioner: does it seem normal to you that an unfinished building should be opened during an election campaign? Does it seem normal to you that the Commission should attend such an absurd event organised by the Spanish Government? It does not fall within my remit to make statements about internal political situations within one Member State or another. As such, I would prefer to withhold any comment on the situation which Mr Berenguer has just described. I have to confess that I fail to comprehend why a certain opening ceremony was held in Spain. What I can say is that I hope that this building will now be occupied as soon as possible. May I also add that I hope to be in Alicante myself at the end of May to speak at a conference. I hope that this building will then be occupied. I would like to point out to the Commissioner that it is not an electoral question. As members of the Committee on Legal Affairs and the Internal Market, we have followed the creation of that institution and it is clear that it was established for electioneering reasons. A year later, it is still not functioning, which means that the Commission spent money on a false opening. We should ask ourselves to what extent this spending of funds was justified. I would like to reiterate that the Commission is unconcerned with the underlying motivation of Member State actions. It is, however, interested in official statements and actions. We do not intend to go in the direction of what is termed in French un procès d'intention. We are concerned with public official actions and events, rather than any possible underlying motivation. This is why I find it also difficult to meet Mr Medina halfway and respond to his question. Once again, the Commission does not speculate why something is happening earlier or later than planned. It only appreciates that a building for this Office is opened and occupied as soon as possible. Also, the Commission does not engage itself in finding out whether certain expenditure was real or virtual. As far as I am concerned, all expenditure is real. And any remaining skeletons, I intend to leave them in the cupboard. Question No 54 by (H-0117/00): Subject: Alcohol monopoly and the internal market What action does the Commission intend to take in order to prevent the extension of the State alcohol monopoly apparently being planned by Sweden, and the associated import restrictions, and to ensure that the rules of the single market are applied?	fr
The fishery sectors in Europe face serious problems and I am a great supporter of the fishery sector. I therefore call upon the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide genuine long-term solutions for fishing communities and not depend upon short-termism. I recommend the report to the House. The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission' s communication and we are also pleased that the Fisheries Committee adopted all our amendments. It is now widely accepted that fishing has effects on marine environment which are much more wide-ranging and pervasive than simple capture of target species with a little bit of by-catch. We welcome the intention of the Commission to integrate environmental protection into other policies of the EU including the common fisheries policy. After all, the treaties have stipulated since 1992 that the precautionary principle and environmental protection should be integrated into Community policies. But as has been pointed out, the adoption of a rigorous definition of the precautionary principle is crucial. This is because it is all very easy to pay lip service to the idea and then to continue with business as usual. The UN Fish Stocks Agreement of 1995 would serve as a very good model in this regard. One aspect that was missing from the communication though is the aspect of surveillance and control. All the good policies and regulations in the world will not lead to conservation without an effective system to ensure that the rules are respected. Control is a Member State competence and the Council has recently adopted a list of serious infringements aimed at coordinating to some extent the severity with which similar violations are viewed in different countries. This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee continually point out, much improvement is needed in the control programmes of all Member States. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his excellent report.  Mr President, fishing is an extremely important economic activity which involves major investment. Most of its jobs are provided under fairly tough conditions throughout entire Community regions. However, some people' s view of the fisheries sector can be extremely simplistic, ranging from mere folklore to the insult of regarding fishermen as insensitive pirates and predators. I regret to say that this report, due to its link with the environment, seems to have provided an occasion for those with this type of view to introduce their own particular misconceptions. If Mr Katiforis' s report had been approved in its initial wording, none of the members of the Committee on Fisheries could have gone into any fishing region again without fear of being lynched. The relationship between fisheries and marine ecosystems is obvious. Yet it is very wide-ranging and involves many other factors including pollution and maritime transport. To blame fishermen alone for environmental damage is both unfair and wrong. Our committee avoided embarrassing itself by making a series of amendments of which I tabled 14, many of which were accepted by the rapporteur for which I thank him sincerely.	de
However, if some of the amendments are accepted, particularly those presented by the PPE-DE Group, we would consider the report to be stripped of its value and to have become an inconsistent document, lacking in rigour and, in that event, we would reconsider our support. Mr President, amongst the various issues being dealt with in this joint debate, I would like to comment on the one mentioned by Mr Berenguer, that is to say, the modernisation of competition policy, which is the subject of the Commission' s White Paper. Frankly, I believe that this modernisation has been satisfactory. Through his management, Commissioner Monti achieves good results, as did his predecessor and, clearly, he has established a guarantee which, in parallel with the creation and development of the European internal market, has been capable of establishing the corresponding corrective measures so that the market economy within the Union may work adequately, without the distortions which we economists know may arise when the market is enlarged, as has happened in the European Union since 1993. If it functions well, if we are satisfied, if the Commission has basically acted correctly, why the need for the modification? Various arguments have been presented in its favour. Mr Berenguer made a very accurate analysis, justifying the need and the relevant reforms for improving the dynamics of competition, but my concern is to ensure that the standards and criteria which will be applied through the corresponding administrations in the Member States, are truly identical in all regions. Because, if this is not the case, we will be faced with the paradox that the Commission itself will introduce elements of unfair competition into the functioning of the European internal market. In that event we would not have moved forward, but rather backwards, in the application of competition policy in the Union. Mr President, I would like firstly to express my appreciation to the Commission for the improvement represented by the XXVIIIth report on competition policy in the Union, when compared to previous reports. I would also like to highlight the work carried out by the rapporteur, Mr Rapkay, who has dissected this dense and comprehensive text in such a concise way. I would also like to fully support his comments on the need to allow the regions - such as the Basque Country, which I represent - a margin for action, by virtue of the principle of subsidiarity. Nevertheless, I cannot forget the numerous criticisms, both from Member States and from market operators, which, given the broad margin for manoeuvre and discretion enjoyed by the Commission in its evaluation of specific cases, maintain that they suffer from legal insecurity in the absence of clear rules allowing interested parties to anticipate the position of the authorities and thereby make feasible requests for aid aimed at the promotion of economic activity and employment, the planning of company mergers etc. The only guarantee has been to seek prior favourable approval, through individual cases, which will take more than six or eight months to resolve, an excessively long period, which simply leads to problems of a lack of flexibility, affecting the generation of wealth and employment.	it
We are inclined to believe that a solid basis exists for this economic growth in the Union, now and in the coming years. It must be taken into account that we have an open, globalised and very competitive economy. In order to reach and even overtake the leading position of the United States of America, we must avoid interventionism, as proposed initially by Mr Katiforis, and also excessive intervention by the public authorities in the construction of certain infrastructures. Furthermore, the Member States refused to contribute more funds when we discussed Agenda 2000 which means that there will be little available over the next few years at Union level. However, we must stress the need to continue developing the construction of the European internal market which still has some serious flaws. There are still sectors such as air transport, energy and telecommunications in which, if we compare our unit cost with that of the USA or other countries which are equally competitive at international level, the cost supported by our companies is very high. This report contains information which shows that in order to create a new company the bureaucratic cost in the USA is EUR 500 and in the European Union, on average, it is EUR 1 600. We therefore still have too much bureaucracy and intervention. It is only by complying with the essential agreements established with the programmes following on from the stability pact and by developing a market with less obstacles at all levels that we will reach the levels of competitiveness required by the European Union. Mr President, the passion that the previous speakers have acknowledged in Mr Katiforis, in my view, only served to call on the European Parliament to respond to the hope of dozens of millions of unemployed people, social outcasts and those living a precarious existence in our European Union. This is the objective, in respect of which he called upon the European Parliament: give hope to the people of Europe. There is indeed economic recovery, but it only marginally reduces unemployment in Europe. The votes of the PPE-DE and the Liberals have very considerably diminished, and even reversed, the meaning of his message. That is why we did not vote in favour of the report as amended by them, despite our efforts, and we shall not vote for it as it stands at the moment. What are the minimum conditions under which we would vote for this report? First of all, the affirmation that there is room for a Europe of growth, but a Europe of sustainable growth, that particularly respects the commitments of the European Union at the conferences in Kyoto and Buenos Aires. There is an enormous amount of work to be done to keep to our commitments by the fateful year 2008, by which time we shall have to return to 1990 levels of greenhouse gas emissions. A tremendous amount of work remains to be done in the field of transport, energy saving and even in substituting travel by communication via the Internet.	fr
