It is therefore essential that this assembly establishes with as much force as possible the principle of the application of the Equal program to all refugees.To conclude, I would like to say that I felt some scruples last week, when we discussed the constitution of the Austrian government.But when it comes to Austrian policy towards refugees, and we have to criticize it, I no longer have any qualms.I hope that Parliament will be able to engage just as much, this time.Mr. President, in the context of the 1994-1999 financial prospects, when 13 different initiatives were carried out, the Interreg II tranfronier program was an important initiative.The fact that the next cycle of structural funds 2000-2006 understands the Interreg initiative proves, I think, very clearly the importance that the national member states of the EU attach to it.The Interreg program for the period 1989-1993 and the Interreg II program for the period 1994-1999 proved to be real success because they brought the economic and social development of border member states.I come from border counties in north-west Ireland, I have therefore seen, over the years, the important role that Interreg I and Interreg II have played, and I congratulate myself on Interreg III.The Commission grants an envelope of 67 million pounds via the Interreg III program, which will be spent to continue the development of cross -border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.The European Union has played a key role in the development of the Irish border counties region over the years.The European Union is the major contributor, with 80 million pounds allocated to the International Fund for Ireland.The European Union contributes 75 % to the Peace and Reconciliation program up to 75 %.Overall, Interreg, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Program have all played an important role in the developing peace process.Mr. President, I will intervene on Interreg by limiting myself to a few critical points, also to respect of course the time imparted to me.We all expressed ourselves positively on the confirmation of this program and on the extension of the intervention sectors, in addition to cross -border cooperation, in terms of transnational and transregional cooperation.This does not prevent us from being aware of the fact that most of the resources - from 50 to 80 percent - will be reserved for cross -border cooperation, with a component A of the Interreg III program;In addition, we continue to think that the choice which was made to consolidate the current sectors of cooperation, with regard to the choice of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.We hope and we hope that, on this point, the Commission recognizes in substance, and not by a formal tribute, the position of the Parliament.Cross -border cooperation continues to consider almost exclusively that land borders and, where there have been exceptions in reference to maritime borders, these exceptions are not transparent in their choice and often benefit from compensations through other community policies.Discrimination is really much more serious for the islands whose regional condition can only be linked to borders exclusively of a maritime nature.	fr
This time the situation was not so bad in Ireland, even though the Atlantic had many serious storms. There were also floods in Ireland, and I want to express my condolences to those Irish who had to suffer from them. My good colleague, we must not all be bad. It is true that the Commission and Parliament jointly decided to eliminate budget points for emergency aid. It is also true that the Commission member Barnier mentioned a lot of European funds that oyster cultivation and agriculture should be invoked to Article 30 of the Rural Development Regulation, Article 33, Forestry, Article 87 (2) of the Companies, and from public infrastructure exceptions. The truth is, however, that now there is no more cents than before the storm was given to demonstrate solidarity in practical action. It is just about the fact that the states are presenting the heads that are talking to each other and taking this point what they give elsewhere. This is unsatisfactory, and I am happy that Barnier brought up a very close idea here, which I would otherwise express my wishes for Bordeaux's press, the idea of ​​establishing a European civil protection policy. It seems to me that our citizens must be extremely distress before the European citizenship we devotedly exists and before we take the tasks that our President Fontaine has set up to support the approach of the Union and European citizens. I therefore believe that the establishment of European civil protection forces for actual civilian sinibaret, which would operate in emergency areas in the Union, because we do not have an emergency procedure today, and if necessary, as needed, in Venezuela or else there would be something we should do, and I want to say to the Commission member Barnieras a European idea. Mr President, the Mr A Member of the Commission, the good colleagues, compared to the density of storms in the rest of the world, we in Europe are relatively often saved from them. Nevertheless, the storms of the last week of December showed what the consequences they could have, and that we will face major problems. Anyone who has traveled to Strasbourg by car or train could convince him of how the storm also caused destruction in Elsas. That is why I would like to express my compassion for all citizens and areas where this storm caused such a bad destruction, while reminiscent of the importance of supporting these areas and their population in Parliament. We all know that a storm may be just as well as another European region tomorrow. Now this damaged wood must be repaired from the forest as soon as possible. Because everyone knows that there may be even greater damage if damaged wood remains in the woods for too long. It must also be reminded, among other things, that damaged wood provides, for example, the best breeding ground for the bark beetles and the larvae, and that there will be aftermaths that we cannot estimate at this stage. Therefore, repairing the damaged wood is necessary even before the warmer season begins. We only realize the actual extent of the damage caused to forestry only after decades. Because we all know how long the tree needs to grow. Then it is counted in decades, not in years. I would also like to remind you that forestry is certainly not just about wood production, but that in a few areas, a protective and safety forest is a key factor. That is why I would like to say very proudly that the Austrian forest professionals are also ready ... (President interrupted the speaker. Sometimes we are not aware of what is happening in other countries in the community.	fi
That's why the European Union loses its credibility. I do not believe, Mr Solana, that we can restore our credibility by military means. As representatives of the European Free Alliance we all come from states and regions that have never declared war on other states, but have always defended themselves against those who wanted to conquer them. We have strong doubts about your plans about the rapid creation of a military force. Not because we are against European defense, but because European defense can be decided solely in the context of a proper and democratic decision -making process. Europe does not currently have a remarkable foreign policy. And I really doubt whether we will be able to devise such a policy with intergovernmental discussions. It is easy to sit on a military table and gather all the military material we find, all these beautiful toys called weapons. However, I am born in strong questions, as I see that Commissioner Patten is not able to present us a reliable plan to prevent, prevention of crisis escalation, prevention of underdevelopment, conflict prevention in Europe and elsewhere. Because our borders do not stop on the Mediterranean coast. Mr President, I will start with the conquest of Kosovo. Eight months after the end of NATO bombings, it is clear that they were not to stop some ethnic cleansing, not for peace and order, but for the further division of Yugoslavia, the change of border, the promotion of the new class. We have today, under the accompanying eyes, the participation, I would say, of the NATO occupation forces, a fierce ethnic cleansing against Serbs and other than Albanianophones. Everything shows that we go for a second round of attack on Yugoslavia, this is confirmed by the UK attacks on Serbs in Mitrovitsa, the attempts to attach to Kosovo three cities in Southern Serbia, the promotion of Kosovo's independence of KosovoThe intensity of NATO and the European Union's efforts to overthrow the legal government of Yugoslavia. On the other hand, despite his declarations of humanity and peace, from what Mr Solana told us today, it is clear that according to Helsinki's decisions we are going to set up a terrorist army for the time being 60,000 men who will hit anyone who lifts his head. Mr Solana's words confirms our position that in the militarized European Union, the upper hand will have NATO. That is why he was also appointed to this position by Mr Solana, NATO Secretary -General, also guilty of the crime committed against Yugoslavia, the right man in the appropriate position, who is pending a complaint to be tried as a war criminal. Mr Commissioner, Mr Sir, it is indisputable that you are moving fast, that you are moving forward and that you have done a lot to promote certain cases. I wonder, and I do not fully agree with the positive interpretations of some of the types of the press and colleagues on the course we are walking.	el
We understand your concern and we will not fail to take it into account, in particular in the context of the future contacts that we will have with Turkey when defining the agenda of the membership strategy planned for Turkey.This question will of course be at the center of our concerns and the European Commission will certainly not fail to take it into consideration.Mr. President, let me thank the president in office of the Council.I am sure that the President in office is a very good man and that he is very kind to his wife, children and dog.That said, you will forgive me if the answer you have just given me leaves me a little skeptical.I do not believe that the public immediately had access to declarations and votes within the council.Could you therefore promise me to write to me, before the next plenary in February, where I can, as a simple citizen, find this information immediately after the adoption of a legislative act by the Council, instead of waiting for it to appear in the press of weeks later?Will you write to me before the next plenary to give me this information?Mr. MP, above all, I would like to say that I dispense with making personal comments like the one by which you started your second question and I will be kind enough to abstain in the future.Regarding the substance of your question, we withdraw the impression that the criticism made to the council, in addition to its specific form which we also take note, does not relate to opacity, let's say, of the legislative process, but almost to excess transparency.I would like to tell you, the deputy, that the results of this type of transparency process are clear to us and undoubtedly.We will not hesitate to repeat this information to you, the deputy, but we cannot go beyond what we have said because it corresponds exactly to what the treaty requires.We therefore believe that all the elements that the General Secretariat of the Council currently makes available to the public are essential elements with regard to the mode of operation of the Council as a legislative authority.It seems to me that the council has not tried to answer my question.I did not ask what his opinion was on the proposal that the commission has not yet presented.My question focused on the interpretation of principle of article 255 of the Amsterdam Treaty.Does it mean that we must also legislate on transparency on the national scale, and not only within the three European institutions which are cited in the article?I would like to get an answer to this question.Does the Council consider that one can, on the basis of article 255 of the treaty, settle national laws in matters of transparency, apart from that which must govern European institutions?	fr
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.I've already been to the French Senate.Throughout this debate, I will also go to the national parliaments directly, if possible.As part of the dialogue with the citizens, it is not about operating propaganda or marketing and also no public relations work.I strive for a real dialogue, and after a short film in which it is factually explained what the institutional reform is all about, those who are on the podium can take the floor with open microphone.We will carry out this initiative, as I would like to repeat, in a punctual or constant cooperation with the Member States, and I have the great wish that the governments of the fifteen with their support under the conditions that they consider to be the most appropriate and reasonable.Mr President, I would like to join Mr. Barnier's study group of 700 interns so that there is also a discussion.It is not so interesting to debate the government conference and openness.In connection with the government conference, Mr. Barnier said in parliament that social policy would not be the subject of majority decisions.On page 63, however, it says that the fight against unequal treatment, the right to freedom of movement and stay - i.e. the residence guidelines - should be decided the entire social security system, the renewal of regulation No. 1408 and the measures in the social policy area with individual exceptions by qualified majority resolutions.Does Mr. Barnier have no concerns that he intervenes in the election process of the Member States?Citizens go to choose from such topics and thereby create new majority in Danish folketing and other parliaments.Can this be steered from Brussels?Is that part of the radical decentralization that Mr. Prodi spoke of this morning?I was very happy when I heard last week that the Commission wanted to pay more attention not only between the Union and the Member States, but between the Union, the member states, regions and cities in the coming years.I hope that Commission Member Barnier will explain this idea in more detail on his dialogue trip through the European regions and to listen and pull closely.Mr. Commissioner, I refer to your answer to a previous question in which you dealt with the possibilities of making the contract - as I want to call it - waterproof in view of the dangers of undesirable developments, and in particular the diversification of sanctions that can be imposed against a member state in application of Article 7 for violating basic freedoms.Do you think that these proposals or suggestions of this kind belong to the mandate of the government conference specified in Helsinki?I don't have this impression on my part.Do you not fear that such sanctions could not only be misused not only against human rights violations, but also against mere disagreements, against opinion offenses or deviations from the prevailing European unit thinking?Yes, Mr. Bonde, we will start this dialogue with 700 young people in Brussels who will work in the institutions and the Commission, and I believe that this start is a good start for this dialogue with motivated young people.	de
The competition between the regions will certainly strengthen the European Union and not weaken.Here I call the topic of GA funding, the example of Sparkassen and Landesbanken, the example of the seal of approval.Here a region has created something on its own to market its own products.This initiative must not be destroyed from a European level.I think that an increase in the Dinimis control is also necessary.We should do everything we can to promote the competition between the regions.The second is a discussion about competition and social market economy, although I am now not talking about market failure.I have already indicated the area of ​​state banks and savings banks, but now I take to the extreme what you hear on one side or the other.A resident of an old people's home is now housed in the social area.But I can also consider him a customer, and I think we should discuss quite clearly and in time about where the social field, where grown structures mean a stop for the competition.Otherwise, I can name any customer, all areas as customers and thereby destroy very social areas.Finally, I would like to say about the principle of subsidiarity: I think it is urgently needed that where Member States enable the regions and the municipalities to charge taxes, this is preserved and is not regulated uniformly by Europe.Thank you, Mr. colleague.I congratulate you on what is inadmissible in German parliamentarianism in German parliamentarianism.President, Mr. Commissioner, values, colleagues!I take the word in the name of my colleague Robert Goebbel, who unfortunately cannot be present because of a political obligation.Within the committee for economy and currency, the Jonckheer report triggered sharp controversy on the question of how the market works.A narrow right majority has succeeded from the report of any reference to the inadequacies of the market.If our parliament mostly follows this ultra -liberal concept of an allegedly perfect market, the world would not change.Economic relationships in the real world make it sufficiently clear that the elimination of any state intervention on the market does not lead to a perfect competition and optimal resource allocation.The market has been the preferred location of the people since ancient times, but never perfect.The market privileges short -term business and quick profits.On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand in general is to the disadvantage of the weakest - the consumer and the employee.The market needs regulation to work.As a counterweight, the necessary and valuable enterprise requires a sense of responsibility towards society.We as European Social Democrats are for a social market economy.The market is not an end in itself, it must serve to improve living conditions.The European Union, the states, must not take the place of economic participants, but the government agencies must determine the rules and goals that enable the economy to develop sustainably.Ultimately, aid can serve to enable restructuring, to offer training courses, to save jobs and thus to save know-how.The main goal of the Union's competition policy cannot be to lower the global subsidy level.	de
I would be delighted, Madame Schroedter, that you can positively consider the inclusion of this amendment proposal, and also in the interest of subsidiarity.Mr. Chairman, the Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has remained unanimous to say that it was strategic and priority to support the interventions of structural and cohesion funds aimed at offering better employment opportunities to the unemployed and to promote equality between men and women.Unfortunately, Schroedter's excellent report did not take into account this criterion despite the many evidence and we will see it later in the Berend report of what these funds actually help the most behind regions to reduce the gap that separates them from the most developed regions of Europe.They grow, but in terms of GDP.Their competitiveness increases, but the increase in wealth does not benefit everyone because employment does not increase and the difference in employment opportunities persists in certain regions.The Commissioner, read the opinion of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee and give him a priority character, because this is where the main problem of citizens lies.In the revision, in the assignment of reserves, take into account, strategically, the need for jobs because this is, ultimately, what the structural funds and cohesion funds require.Mr. President, it is important that the guidelines make it possible to properly guide and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs of the crucial period of seven years 2002-2006, so that finally realizes sustainable development, employment aid, especially for women and young people, and that the balance between economic, social and environmental policies is ensured.It is particularly necessary to attack acute urban problems, to preserve employment in rural areas and, of course, to offer, as precisely provides for article 158 of the treaty, equal chances of development in the European Union islands, also in the Greek islands which represent half.The Union cohesion policy must still be reinforced, because a Europe whose regions have enormous differences in standard of living cannot be credible or viable.Mr. President, ladies, gentlemen, I would like to tell you the great interest that I took carefully listening to the observations, sometimes the criticisms and suggestions that both of you made in your interventions, from the report of Mrs. Schroedter.Everyone understands, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons, the deadlines - I will come back in a moment - and whatever these deadlines or these delays, since it is now that we discuss this report, I consider, in the name of the Commission, that it comes at the right time, being the orientations 2000-2006, since it is at the moment that we are starting the new regional programming.Madam Rapporteur, you rightly recalled that it is in fact mainly in the Member States and the regions to define their own development priorities, the co -financing of programs by our European Union demands, justifies that it is also taken into account of community priorities as they are debated and approved here, in order to promote this community dimension of economic and social cohesion.	fr
It is difficult to exercise moderate, long -term politics, which we must apply here and now, when we present to the citizens of Europe such a picture of the future, while they are afraid of their jobs. Mr Prime Minister, we would like to believe, like you and the Portuguese presidency, that Europe must be built such as a culture whose economic and social prosperity is based on the utilization of knowledge, cultural diversity and cohesion, and which plays an active role in promoting a more political and cohesion. We would also like to believe, like you, that it is clear and common consciousness that the range of changes, which must be predicted regarding the necessary specialization to tackle the new technological challenges of businesses, also poses the risk of creating new mechanisms of social exclusion. We would like to believe it, but we can't. Why? Because we know that certainly the new economy makes it possible to show new jobs for creators, for IT experts. We observe the intense mobility by which investment trends are multiplied and the phenomenon of starting new businesses is developing, but we also know the resignations of personnel that characterize the call centers, due to the awful working conditions that reign in these new temples. We know that more than half of the jobs created now in the European Union are precarious, temporary and forced part -time, and that because of this they do not guarantee employees neither conditions of personal autonomy nor, often, incomes that will allow them to live a decent life. We know that new technologies do not produce more democracy themselves, but merely more collective and individual autonomy for those citizens who have been best adapted to social conditions. We know that the privatizations of public organizations set the social, territorial and regional cohesion under the end, as well as we are aware that the Commission proposes to accelerate the procedure. We know that the EP Union of Industries, says, as of employers, open its intentions to the European Summit for Business Summit for June in Brussels: Public authorities are requested to remove all social, regulatory and tax obstacles from the development of businesses. Finally, we know that anyone who claims to meet the needs of citizens must first guarantee their complete participation in the selection of public policies. We know all this. However, we have not read or heard anything that says that the setting up of the high -level expert team would be taken into account, according to which the full financial success of the information society presupposes that the information society will be fueled by the real needs of citizens, and not just the demands of the markets. We did not hear that all the effective experiences related to the common and solidarity of new information technologies would be supported, nor that the role of the collective bodies for the training and information of the whole public will be encouraged.	el
It is indicated, in paragraph 11, that symbolic measures can replace the political agreement, the political perspective represented by being a candidate.But it is not only a chief of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, dear colleagues, if the negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.And I challenge you to think that, among the countries of the Balkans, within three years, you will not have, on the part of Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia, requests for membership in good and due form.Mr. Racan announced a few days ago, the form of formal membership of Croatia for the end of the year 2000. I am sure that we will have other membership requests and therefore that this beautiful work, this beautiful intellectual architecture will collapse, because it will be overwhelmed by events, as we have been overwhelmed for twenty years by everything that happened in the former Yugoslavia.This would not be serious if there were not the problems that we know in this region of Europe, if there were not the problems which are faced, but which have not yet been resolved by the new government of Macedonia, the problems of cohabitation between the Macedonian majority and the Albanese minority, with the related problems of Kosovo, if there were not the economic problems that we know,Serbia, if there was not the problem which is a veto that should be denounced for what it is, the veto of Greece which, after almost ten years, continues to prevent this country being called by name, and I hope that the performers did not use the term fyrom when I spoke of Macedonia.This is absolutely absurd.I think it is an offense, first of all, with regard to our Greek colleagues, with regard to Greek citizens.It is urgent that this question is resolved.Finally, I had by a blessed chance a letter addressed by Mr. Georgievski, president of Macedonia, to Mr. Fischler, dated March 8, in which, referring to article O, today article 49 of the treaty, he requests that Macedonia can join the European Union.Why has the council not informed us?Why did the Commission not inform us of this formal request from Macedonia?Mr. President, the Commissioner, the Balkans are not only an obscure, politically speaking abyss.It is enough to see the clearly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia in recent years, critical years.The abominable ethnic climbing in neighboring Kosovo did not make oil on its territory.Paradoxically, but this is true, the war on the battlefield of Kosovo Polje had exactly the opposite effect: the dangerous gulf of mistrust between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority has been sharply reduced.In the opinion of the first, the last behaved loyal to the common state during the international explosion of conflict in Kosovo.And in the perspective of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have largely fulfilled their obligations of neighbors towards the Albanian majority of Kosovo so hard.This remarkable result of the conflict in Kosovo can therefore rightly qualify as a second internal political pillar of the Republic of Macedonia.	fr
"We know and have said it in very many resolutions - specifically in last year's last plenary session - that this is not just a legal case and it is wrong to blame Alexander Nikitit for crime and fraud because we use his results. These results form a basis for European Barents Sea protection programs, and therefore I ask you to carefully look at the draft of the letter, which explains the most important facts and to make this position clear in Russia in the spirit of Parliament decisions. Yes, after receiving a member, after receiving your letter, I'll be happy to find out about the issues related to this question. Mr President, at first I would like to thank you for having your words and that the number of television channels in our rooms has really increased tremendously during the first session of the New Year has really increased. However, the Mr President, what I asked, has not happened. There are now two Finnish channels and one Portuguese channel, and I asked you a Dutch channel because the Dutch also wants to follow the news every month when we are sent here to the expulsion site. I would like to ask you once again to make sure we also get a Dutch channel. Member Plooij-Van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda of Next Wednesday's meeting. I hope it is treated in a positive spirit. Mr President, can you tell me why Parliament does not comply with health and safety legislation that it actually accepts itself? Why wasn't the air quality of this building been tested while we were members? Why is the Committee on Health and Safety Affairs since 1998? Why are there no fire exercises at Parliament in Brussels or Strasbourg's premises? Why have no instructions given for fire? Why have there not been any improvements in the staircase after the accident that has happened to me? Why have not been implemented ""Smoking Forbidden"" areas? It is really embarrassing that we accept laws and do not follow them ourselves. Member Lynne, you are absolutely right, and I'm going to check if all of this really hasn't been done. I also submit this problem to the Quartoral College and I am sure that it is very important for our accounts to follow the legislation we have accepted ourselves. Mr President, Díez González and I had asked a few questions about certain statements on the Commission Vice -President de Palacio, published in a Spanish daily newspaper. The competent units have not taken any questions on the agenda, as the units have already answered them during the previous session period. I ask that this decision be canceled, as it is not the case. The questions previously answered are related to the speech of De Palacio, Vice-President of the Commission, and not in these statements published in ABC last November 18th. Good colleague, we'll check it out. I have to admit that at the moment things seem a little confused to me. So we go through the matter very carefully to get everything good. Mr President, I would like to know if Parliament this week is sending a clear message to the outside world about how dissatisfied we are to today's decision that weapon exports to Indonesia will not be continued, especially if we consider that the parliamentary majority has previously supported the ban on exports of weapons? Today's decision not to continue the export ban is very dangerous if we take into account the situation in Indonesia. Therefore, Parliament should send such a message, as the majority of the majority hopes for it. It is irresponsible for EU Member States to refuse to continue exporting weapons. As many have said, the situation in Indonesia is extremely prone to explosion. There is indeed a risk of a future military coup. We don't know what's going on. So why should EU weapons manufacturers make a profit at the expense of innocent people?"	fi
The question is therefore: what requirements should we possibly ask a monopoly or part of the services that are mastered by a monopoly?On this point, most Member States have always refused to move forward and I am satisfied to be able to note that in my country, the new government is concerned with a subject that should have been treated for a long time and that the Belgian Post and the Belgian government are currently taking the necessary measures in order to ensure that the Post is, for a part, ready to support competition by 2003.That it poses me a lot of problems.I have consulted a series of studies which were commissioned at the time by the European Commission, but at the same time, I find post-Europe documents which claim that these studies are not correct and that the basis on which they were carried out is wrong.I think the commission could at least be a little more active on this point and could have provided us with a little more information.She could also have sent us the studies she had promised us and that we also asked.As far as I know, this has not yet been the case.I therefore ask you, Mr. Commissioner, to help a new member like me in his heavy task.Like Mr. Miller, I would greatly appreciate that in the months or weeks to come, and even if possible in the coming days, you explain to us where the execution of the 1997 directive is. Second point: what is the state of progress of the universal service, how much it costs, how is it organized, how do you plan, what proposals can you formulate?I would like to receive more concrete information on this subject.Apparently, La Poste is a very powerful lobby and rightly so.Hundreds of thousands of people earn their lives in La Poste.In addition, Mr. Miller also pointed out, my country will not be scratched either from the card, despite the density of its population, if the factor does not pass every day.However, we have a large number of people with us, elderly for example, who see only one person on their day and it is the factor.So let's also try to take it into account.La Poste represents much more than the simple transport of packages and letters.For companies too, La Poste is particularly important.It emerges from a study that 90 % of postal traffic is carried out between companies, compared to 10 % between people.What actually do you want to liberalize?I would like to be better informed about this, because the most important question is how you can better serve the customer with the services that exist.There are postal companies that have a monopoly and which still work in a very valid way.	fr
The reports must be submitted to the Parliament Fisheries Commission before decisions are made, otherwise we are only an approval organization.I know that it is hardly the intention of the commission or the commissioner, but we must learn from the errors of the past.Mr. President, we are faced with a proposal aimed at transposing a recommendation from the Cicta into community legislation - which, as has been said, dates from 1998 -, which should be in force since June 1999 and which only reached Parliament at the end of last year.The commission's legislative laziness on certain questions should not surprise us, except because we find ourselves before the recommendation of one of the most important international fishing organizations in the protection of a resource as threatened as tuna.The Mediterranean, and in particular one of its areas, is a very important reproduction area for red tuna, whose commercial value is enormous.This is the reason why the Cicta recommended this closing area in the Adriatic and has strengthened the conditions relating to the capture of zero age tuna.As the rapporteur said, the two measures are completely and largely justified, which is why we can only request their approval.But I also agree with Mr. Gallagher, who expressed his frustration before the slowness of the commission to start the machine and convert recommendations into community regulations.We are still awaiting, for example, the proposal for the ban on the ban on importing the red tuna of Honduras and Belize, a recommendation which dates from 1996. According to my information, it seems that, the CEO of fishing sent a note in the CEO of trade in January and that it has already started preparatory work.But four years to make the ban on imports of known countries effective to promote the pavilions of convenience is an absolutely intolerable period, the Commissioner.We have heard the explanations of the Commission on the long internal process which consists of a transposition, and the image that has remained to us is that of an exasperating bureaucracy.With regard to the only proposal with a view to accelerating what is currently on the table, by which the council and the parliament of the procedure are dismissed, I feed certain doubts.In any case, it is clear that we will have to end up finding a solution to the problem, either within the framework of the Commission report on regional fishing organizations, or, if possible, as quickly as possible.I assume that no one in this assembly is opposed to the principle of the protection of juveniles of marine organizations.Indeed, it is often noted that one of the general objectives of the common fishing policy must be the protection and conservation of living aquatic resources.All this is worthy of praise.Likewise, one cannot doubt the enormous environmental and financial importance of the red tuna.Being myself a confirmed fisherman, I would like the good old days of the 1930s to return when the fishermen of the port of Scarborough, in Yorkshire, grabbed red tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.I do not know the metric equivalent.	fr
Competition, that is to say the war to which large companies are engaged in each other, is constantly reflected in layoffs, by factories, not to mention the immense waste in terms of the use of productive capacities.We still have an example with the job removal plan in Europe from the Trust Abb Alsthom Power.18 million unemployed, 50 million poor in the European Union, yet one of the richest regions in the world: this is the result of this competition that European institutions intend to promote.The desire to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market expressed by the Commission is derisory, because the only law to which competition obeys is the law of the jungle where the most powerful crush or devour the lowest.It is especially revolting on the social level.The European Commission's report crudely shows that the institutions of the Union are only interested in the large capitalist groups which are engaged in this economic war and not at all in the victims it has.Nothing to prevent the extension of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent large companies from pushing for misery a fraction of the population, simply to enrich their shareholders even more!So, if we recognize this report a merit, it is that of showing that the laborious majority of society has nothing to hope for European institutions to preserve and, even less to improve, its conditions of existence.By voting against this report, we make the spokespersons of all those who have marked their refusal, in Seattle and everywhere in Europe, of a world reduced to a strict market logic.We voted against this report on behalf of the development of public services, and in particular, in memory of the victims of the Paddington Train accident, which were killed not by fatality but by an absurd relentlessness to put competition where it would be necessary.This report is, basically, a primitive text which has no other inspiration than the law of the jungle, because competition cannot solve any of the problems that arise in humanity at this turning point of the century.Whether it is the balance of the biosphere, the promotion of culture or cooperation with the Third World, excessive competition is a factor of regression and insecurity.And the 18 million unemployed in Europe, do you think they are victims of an overly timid application of this competition policy?We are convinced of the contrary, and we also do not think that state aid are by definition too high.Compared to which iron rule, what effectiveness criteria would they be?Finally, after Seattle, do you find it serious to recommend an increased role in the WTO?Only multinational lawyers can show such obstinacy.Jonckheer report (A5-0087/1999) I welcome the quality of the seventh report on state aid in the EU, the now annual nature of its publication and the fact that the General Directorate of Competition diffuses general and specific information on its website.	fr
While the Commission is not considering reviewing this directive, its services are ready to guide the Member States to implement it, and we are finally starting to move on to this point. The only areas taken into account by the Commission under the Directive on habitats are those presented by the Member States. The so -called shadow catalogs can only contribute to the efforts to identify these areas within the Member States. At the Community level they can contribute to the scientific reference material for the inventory of natural habitats and existing species. Thank you for enlightening us, but we are very sorry for what you have just said, because we had the impression that the previous committee had a simple principle as a starting point: no resources were available without catalogs. Today you are returning to this principle and re -address the Member States to ask them to provide you with lists. They are actually delayed. Have been too late in relation to European directives. Today we do not know yet if you intend to apply the technical, legal and political means available to you to impose compliance with European directives. Therefore, I can very well imagine the Member States really mocking this new directive because they have finally won another time, and the protection of nature is going to be harmed another. From examining the various reports of the European Union and the European Environment Agency we know that environmental degradation continues. Therefore, the question I ask is: Today, did you require the list of areas protected under the instructions by accepting the plan of the Community Support Framework for Portugal? E-de). Mr President, the first report I made as a Member had exactly the subject we are discussing today: Environment and Structural Funds. And I have reached, of course, to the main conclusion that the structural actions funded should in no way affect the environment of the member states and that the importance given to the environmental dimension at all levels of planning and implementation of the relevant Union policies should be enhanced. That's what I say today. That is, I say that our main goal should always be sustainable growth, that is, growth that will respect and promote the environment. That is why, in this regard, I believe that the European Parliament, in its resolution, should call on the Commission to implement structural funds programs in a manner that takes into account Community environmental legislation, in particular with regard to the guidelines for the preservation of natural habitats and wild birds. At the same time, however, we should avoid exaggerations, not stop all programs, and not approve of anyone if there are no guarantees to comply with one or two regulations. This would remind me of a Greek proverb that says you can't cut your head when your tooth hurts. I do not suggest that we violate the legislation. On the contrary, I propose to proceed with the implementation of the programs while controlling the implementation of the legislation, of course ensuring the Commission's informing the parliament.	el
For different aspects of sustainability, the European Environmental Agency has already taken action with the Commission. I want to mention, as many speakers have mentioned today that environmental and cultural heritage is expected to become the fastest growing tourism industry in the EU over the next two decades. These opportunities should be fully utilized. Provan said I was talking a lot about tourism and information technology. I am personally convinced that the communication and communication technology (ICT) becomes a key factor in the competitiveness and innovation of European tourism. The tourism industry is a pioneer in the use of ICT equipment. It decisively changes its approach. The major changes and improvements are expected to apply to marketing, reservations and transport services. The use of ICT brings a whole new dimension to the tourism industry. The direct connection between the business and the consumer replaces the current almost exclusively relationship between businesses or in some cases reduces it. It offers more and better choice for travelers and creates new and better tourism products. In the Commission's view, this requires that the actions to be carried out in tourism must be closely associated with measures to promote the adoption of ICT in the tourism industry, especially through innovation programs and innovative society technology programs, both of which are part of my industry. The new strategy presented in the Commission Communication on Tourism and Employment and approved by the Council emphasizes that the tourism sector must collect and share information and good practices. The implementation of the statistical data directive is to improve the knowledge of market structures and flows in European tourism and tourism industry. The Commission's decisions have promoted the adoption of statistics. This year's work program is part of this year's work program. The social and economic impact of tourism is also being studied with international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization. The most important task of the European Community is to ensure a framework that allows advocates and authorities to utilize and encourage them to utilize the potential for growth and employment related to tourism at all levels. Such a European strategy can be implemented on the basis that Member States and the Commission are committed to cooperating in a number of primary areas: in the exchange and distribution of data, especially through new technology, and in education to promote the quality, tourism products and sustainable development of tourism. In the fall, the Commission will report on the development in this area. The report on the work on the work of the Member States and the tourism sector should be completed in about two years. Then, according to the results of the work, a broader discussion could well be a starting point for even broader political initiatives. Medina Ortega asked me a few very concrete questions. When looking at the importance of tourism policy in these communities, we must take into account that many areas of politics have a tremendous impact on the framework of tourism. Not only is specific tourism activities targeted, but also other horizontal measures related to the transport sector. Currently, the basic problem is the congestion of airspace and roads. In the environmental sector, we are looking for ways to cooperate with Commission member Wallström, and in regional policy, Commission member Barnier pays much attention to this field. We need an approach where tourism passes all policies. I am sure that we will be able to improve the situation in the future when we have received a good high -level expert group report and your support in the form of this report and when the tourism industry has been transferred to business policy. Why is it so important in this field? Because corporate policy emphasizes how to help create new businesses and how to set up your own business for young people and women. These groups have potential. If we are able to eliminate obstacles, make it cheaper to start new companies, make it easier to get funding and make society more positive about entrepreneurship, I am sure that the tourism industry will benefit first. There is one problem I hesitated today because this industry is new to me.	fi
My job as the author of the opinion of the environmental committee is a very simple one.I can agree with the rapporteur and say that the environmental committee has asked the committee for agriculture and rural development and asked to agree to the Commission's proposal.I have gained a lot of time that I sometimes would like for other things and that I will now use a little in anticipation, as Mr. Böge has already done.My report on Tse is not yet available to the house.We were a bit undecided at first, even if we regret it.But I came to the conclusion, it is actually a very clever timing.It is actually quite good that we can already give a few placement of the contracts based on this commission, Mr. Byrne.After we may not have dealt with each other so much with the report from Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf and will certainly not come so close to each other, it may be that it is a little different in this area.Let me say in advance that the part of the complex report that Mr. Böge treated - by the way - a form of good cooperation between two committees, one committee is responsible, the other gives the other an opinion from time to time, which may be an example of the future - is relatively simple.It becomes more difficult if we will see the TSE proposal, Mr. Byrne.If we ask questions directly, the questions that Mr. Böge has already mentioned will come.The question will come -and I will have to put them in the committee -as it will look like with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.How will the BSE status actually be defined?Will you also consult a willingness to apply a BSE test for the question of BSE status?And then my constant question to you, Mr. Byrne, whom you already know and which she does not surprise: What about the BSE test?When will you introduce it?Maybe you will even do that before this parliament advises on the TSE report.Not that I want to delay it, but it would be a gesture, so to speak, if you could say: And here the legislative proposal to the BSE tests is available for you!I know that I torture her with it, Mr. Byrne, but sometimes that has to be.I say very emphatically - and afterwards to the report by Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is certainly linked to the overall idea - animal nutrition, animal husbandry, animal production must be in such a way that it is on the one hand, on the one hand, it must be so that it does not harm and endanger people.It cannot be the case that you can exclude cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other products on the grounds that no damage could arise or that is not dangerous.That is certainly too short, too scarce and too little.With Mr. Böge's report, you are lucky enough to treat it on the side.But you will have the problem with my report that you have to justify yourself a little more and you will get a little more problems with it.	de
Otherwise, I find that we work in terms of symptoms but that we do not fight the causes.The population is very critical, particularly in relation to the use of GMOs.We have to face the growing awareness of the population vis-à-vis GMOs and accordingly regulate their use in animal food.First, if an additive consists of genetically modified organisms where it contains such organizations, it can only be authorized if it presents no risk to human health and for the environment.Second, it is wise to enhance provisions for the additives genetically modified in the food of animals, like the rules of the law on the circulation of seeds, as the rapporteur has also mentioned.Thirdly, finally, to have a transparent consumer policy, we need a labeling for animal feed which is genetically modified.This explicit declaration as to the composition of animal feed therefore allows double freedom of decision, both for animal food users and for subsequent consumers.I find that the decision should be the responsibility of the citizen.We all talk about citizens who are shaken by scandals, who have lost confidence in food security.With coherent regulations on additives in animal feed, we can make an essential contribution to the restoration of confidence.I am therefore also very impatient to hear your answer with regard to our amendments.We will therefore naturally vote so that we can possibly send the proposal to the committee.Mr. President, dear colleagues, this proposal to modify the directive concerning additives in animal feed, which dates back to 1970, is the first of a whole series of proposals on the theme of animal food.In the coming months, we will therefore discuss a few here in Parliament.The major attention that the European public has paid dioxin scandals, antibiotics, purification sludge, etc.proves the crucial importance of this theme.It is therefore an important element in the protection of public health.This is why we are of the opinion that it is necessary to use article 152 as a legal basis, and not of article 37, as proposed by the Commission.The modification that the Commission proposed, namely an equal treatment of the additives which was authorized before and after December 31, 1987, is indisputable and has our full support.The Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development, however, has made some important changes to the commission proposal, unanimously.The regulations proposed by the Commission includes the risk of monopoly when marketing certain additives.The right of request is only granted to those who have received the initial authorization, but companies which later received an authorization are excluded.We should avoid such a monopoly, which could for example lead to an increase in animal feed prices, by granting provisional authorization to all companies that put a determined substance on April 1, 1998. This authorization is then valid until the re -evaluation procedure is concluded.The main change in relation to the commission's proposal concerns the adoption of provisions on genetically modified organizations in the additives directive, recommended by the rapporteur.He took as a starting point the compromise, negotiated between the Parliament and the Commission, on the authorization of the GMOs outside the directive relating to dissemination.This compromise already represents the base for the authorization of GMO.It is therefore logical to also provide provisions on the additives of genetically modified animal food in this case, in accordance with the regulations that we have already adopted in other areas - I will only cite the field of forest reproductive materials.	fr
I would like to notice that considerable progress in this area has been made in Italy;We were probably the first in Europe to prove a regulation to promote the withdrawal of old vehicles, but we also have a fairly outdated vehicle population in our country and are therefore seriously concerned with regard to the market problems that the available guideline could cause.In my opinion, the situation must be carefully analyzed.In Italy, about 80 % of the old vehicles are withdrawn and exploited, but we have a market problem that - since the Italian industry often uses short -time work and layoffs - lead to crisis -bearing phenomena in the employment sector and that workers in various parts of Italy could bring serious difficulties.Therefore, in my opinion you should try to reconcile the two requirements - I sometimes find a somewhat extremist attitude in this parliament.h.Either radically green or diametrically opposite points of view are represented - and to find a synthesis, as in my opinion, all in all the efforts of Mr. Florence and other MPs to somehow in accordance with both points of view.As a result, we now have the interesting amendments;In my opinion, a balanced solution for the problem can be found on the basis of the position that is represented here and the environmental issues can be reconciled with market and employment requirements.Mr. President, this guideline concerns the increasing but comparatively minor problem of scrap cars and the question of more systematic disposal of all vehicles when you have reached the end of your lifespan.For this reason, the guideline may seem desirable, even if it is not urgently required.Now the following key questions arise: Who pays the 262 euros per vehicle for the nine million vehicles that are disposed of every year?Who comes up for the recording, dismantling, disposal, etc.?And should the guideline apply retrospectively to all vehicles that have ever been made?As part of the common point of view, the Council suggests that the costs should be at the expense of the automobile manufacturers.That would be billions of pounds or euros that would come to the large manufacturers in the individual countries of the European Union.The costs would inevitably pass on the prices and thus to the buyers of new cars.Since the European automobile manufacturers have been in business much longer than the Japanese, Korean or other companies, the burden for older European companies would be much greater, which was the same for the competition for a significant competitive advantage.I support Mr. Florence, Mr. Lange and others, who tried to compromise on both sides of the political spectrum based on the cost section.I recommend that I and my colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Great Britain agree to agree to the reproach of the proposed measure.REFICIAL LATIONS are poor legal files, they are unfair and frequently impracticable.They are in principle rejected by the majority of democratically chosen parliaments in the free world, unless there is a predominant public interest, which is clearly not the case here.That is why I asked for a name in this matter.	de
This is the area on which the ideological struggle for Europe is concentrated.In my opinion, the debate made it clear.This evening it has become very clear where the political break runs, and it is therefore not surprising that this topic has polarized the debate in a house that is known for its consensus and his policy of compensation.And I am pleased that this difference in opinion comes into play so much, because we are dealing with a radical report.This report is supposed to shake Europe.This report contains radical measures that will ultimately make relief for the labor market.It's that simple. The unemployment rates in Europe are so terrifyingly high because in many cases it is too difficult to hire employees due to bureaucracy, the existing framework and the inflexibility of the labor markets.The only way is now shown.Social justice, and that is what we are all about here, can only be established in Europe if there are prosperity, opportunities and jobs.This report shows very clearly how these goals can be achieved most effectively, because Europe has to wake up.With government spending alone, you cannot create jobs.You cannot create jobs by reducing working hours by law, as if jobs were a cake that can be cut and divided among the citizens.The real world works differently.And if Europe should stay behind if it is supposed to remain in stagnation and unemployment, standing in standstill and the state order, then you will vote against this report tomorrow.But if you want Europe to develop further, so that the citizens of Europe benefit, I call them all to support this report, because it will create the required jobs and opportunities.There is no other option.President, dear colleagues!The great advantage of the original version of the report of Mr. Giorgos Katiforis was that important recommendations for a strategy of the European Union were derived from the concrete statements of the Commission about the EU economy, which could have been the perspective of sustainable development for all countries in our continent in 2000.These recommendations concerned the need for an effective coordination of economic policy at the Union level, i.e.h.The overcoming of the separate management of economic and social policy, which has so far seriously hindered the determination of a coherent strategy to combat unemployment.This vacuum of an administration of the economy at European level is, dear colleague from Wogau, which at least partially causes the weakening of the euro.The recommendations of the report also concerned the creation of a common European research space and the funding - in all Member States of the Union - corresponding measures in the field of research, lifelong learning and employment, whereby every form of unfair tax competence between the states should be overcome.Finally, the proposals of the Weißbuch by President Delor to promote a European project for the creation of a uniform infrastructure and service network were also updated.These recommendations, which largely match the orientations of the program document of the Portuguese Council presidency and are therefore treated at the summit in Lisbon, were rejected or distorted in the committee of the economy and currency of this parliament, namely by a majority that only and solely in the ideological dislocation against a European Union, which on the convergence of the national policy measuresInstead of just being based on one market structure, it was possible to find.	de
Many Member States have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests or made no commitment in this regard and, therefore, it was clear that something more radical had to be undertaken.We must take this responsibility seriously.We must be able to start prosecution against people who commit fraud to the detriment of the European Union.The question is as follows: Who begins the proceedings?This is where things really get bunched.Who is responsible when you have to do with a structure that crosses so many borders?We must also listen to the concerns of the Member States.The proposal to establish a European public prosecutor is very sensitive.We are all aware of the fact that a complete federal approach and a European judicial authority prevailing on national judicial authorities constitute an too premature step for certain people.However, the discussion must be started and we therefore invite the CIG to do so.The way of reacting vis-à-vis the personnel of the institutions of the European Union is of crucial importance for the Parliament, guardian of the budget of the European Union.At a time when we examine the entire reform process, it is essential that we issue the appropriate signal.People committing fraud must understand that they will be continued, which is not currently the case.Ms. Palacio stressed the question of whether we had the legal authority to do so.I would clearly say that my group will offer an amendment to eliminate details concerning how the commission should tackle this problem.We know it is a delicate debate.We know that the Commission may need the possibility of negotiating a situation that would be acceptable to all parties.Let me clearly say that there is no commitment here in favor of a corpus juris, nor in favor of a European prosecutor.However, there is a commitment resolved in favor of a modification of the status quo which is completely unacceptable.Mr. President, I will start by sending my congratulations to Ms. Theato for her report.I think it is an excellent quality report that will obtain the support of my group in its major.I only have the very clear impression that he would have liked to go even before.After hearing the debates of these last five or six months, it seems very possible to me.We all know that in 1995, it was agreed that it would be necessary to ensure better criminal protection of the financial interests of the European Union.Unfortunately, the Member States have not played the game. It is a purely political fact and, at the moment, we cannot do much, it seems to me.However, there remains the possibility that the Commission will take new initiatives on the basis of article 280 of the treaty and I would suggest that the Commission do so as quickly as possible.Unlike the previous speaker who has already left us, my group is very favorable to the institution of a European prosecutor.	fr
Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Solbes Mira.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Excessive deficits annexed to the Treaty establishing the EC The agenda calls for the A50013/2000 report by Mr. Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the proposal for the Council Regulation modifying the Regulation (EC) 3605/93 relating to the application of the Protocol on the procedure concerning excessive deficits annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM (99) 0444 - 0444 - 0444 -C5-0174/99 - 1999/0196 (CNS)) Mr. President, I also have the pleasure of greeting the Spanish Commissioner, M. Solbes, which I have several times congratulated, inside and outside the Parliament, for the excellent work he has done in the Kingdom of Spain in the field of European convergence.The proposal to modify these regulations, relating to the application of the protocol on the procedure concerning excessive deficits annexed to the treaty establishing the European Community, raises a fundamental question concerning adaptation to the European system of dry 95 accounts which, as you know, replaces the previous system of integrated accounts in 79 and above all a question concerning the appearance of new ranges of financial products, consistency in the proportionsGross in light of this European system of 1995 accounts and, finally, concerning taking into account the importance of calculating interest expenditure and their consistency with this new methodology.In my opinion, the proposal for a regulation aims to update the definitions and assessments of certain economic operations involved in the calculation of the deficit within the meaning of the Maastricht Treaty, which sets Maxima percentages for the deficit of public administrations compared to GDP at market prices in different states.Until now, the States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the SEC 79 methodology. The last estimate we have is that which was given in September 1999 and which referred to the 1998 accounting year. Also, if these regulations are approved, the estimate corresponding to March 2000, the first estimate of the 1999 accounting exercise deficit, will already be made in accordance with this new system.We know that the Member States have done - so to speak - their duties, they calculated and developed their national accounts in accordance with the 95 SEC 95, and their corresponding estimates are already published.This supposed, in addition to incorporating the new methodology, the nominal revision of most aggregates and accounting operations due to methodological changes and more refined statistical information incorporated into estimates.Naturally, these changes are likely to modify public deficits in terms of national accounts of the Member States.And very briefly, I will say what are the five areas that may be the subject of the most important changes.First, the adjustments in the delimitation of what we mean by institutional sector public administrations according to the SEC 95. This is important because the public deficit refers to what, in this case, all public administrations.	fr
Representatives of farmers have contacted a few members of the United Kingdom from the United Kingdom, as they are very concerned that the Waste Burning Directive is applied to all farm waste incineration plants in the UK. There are reportedly several thousands of these, and the overall impact of the controls presented in the Directive would increase the cost of each working waste incineration plant by approximately £ 200,000. Such waste incineration plants usually deal with animal waste and empty pesticides in the field of agriculture and have a capacity of less than 50 kg per hour. Both methods meet the basics of the best environmental practice and have been approved by the UK environmental inspectors. There is no exception to this in Article 2 (2), and the closure of waste incineration plants after the entry into force of the Directive would cause huge problems for the United Kingdom farmers in costs and the disposal of animal waste. I ask the Commission member the following question that I hope he can answer when he arrives: is this the first time the European Commission hears about this problem because we have not made an exception that takes into account such farm waste incineration plants? Has the Commission received any petition from the UK ministers? Can a Commission member tell when it is possible to check the Directive to introduce these exceptions - provided that Parliament sometimes accepts them - and is it likely that such animal waste and empty pesticide burning in farm waste incineration plants can be accepted? I have notified the Commission member of these questions. Mr President, waste handling and whole waste policy form an increasingly important part of the EU environmental policy. In order to do reasonably and correctly, we have to keep in mind what has already been said here, namely the hierarchy of waste, prevention of waste, recycling, energy use and final treatment. The proposal of the Commission does not fully meet this idea, it is rather that everything can and can burn everything. In the second handling of the environmental, the Public Health and Consumer Policy, the Committee on Public Health and Consumer Policy added to the joint position the necessary checks that promote the hierarchy of waste, and I hope that these perspectives will also be accepted in tomorrow's vote. I also hope for support for the proposal with widespread support in the committee to facilitate burning from the waste production site of the paper and cellulose industry. This waste is an important source of energy not only for the industrial plant itself but also to the surrounding community. Because the waste hierarchy is carried out in very different ways in different Member States and in most countries the same furnace burns both dangerous and harmless waste, quite strict rules are needed. However, in countries where waste recycling is reasonably well done, as in Finland and knowing what is being burned somewhere, stricter measurement obligations do not improve the state of the environment, but on the contrary may weaken it as waste burning in small burning plants and transport distances increase. However, in the absence of impurities, it would be necessary for exceptions to tight standards only when the waste burner can really show that no more emissions can be reached in the air than the permit conditions allow. Mr President, the purpose of the waste incineration directive is good, but I think the preparation has gone too far into the details. Above all, I have a concern for the so -called co -incineration of waste. Sorted municipal waste and, for example, the fibrous sludge generated in the forest industry processes are good fuel in addition to other fuels for many heating plants. However, the draft requires continuous, expensive, partly impossible and environmentally unnecessary measurements for plants engaged in parallel incineration. The end result is contrary to the original goals: harmless sorted waste, which is a fair fuel for heating plants, has to be used to increase methane emissions to the landfill, or have to be transported hundreds of kilometers of environmental fuel plants. There are many problematic checks in the report. In my opinion, the matter should be returned to the committee or in the general position of the Council.	fi
Of course, the question of where the amounts of alcoholic beverages that are not imported by travelers come from. The answer is that they are illegally introduced or that they are illegally produced by the residents of Sweden themselves, and as Mr. Andersson knows this situation is particularly dangerous and at the expense of public health. Perhaps, of course, Mr. Andersson believes that public health is the most important criterion for limiting alcohol beverages. In this case, however, not only Sweden, but also all the countries of the European Union, should ban any sale of alcoholic beverages. This was done by the United States in the past. Mr. Andersson will know what the so -called Prohibition means. It will also be aware of its consequences on mafia activities in the United States, which were eventually forced to decide to remove the ban. This means that of course public health should be protected, but not through the ban, because such a measure would be ineffective. Mr President, in fact this is the proceeds from the Swedish monopoly of alcoholic beverages and, if the Swedish government considers to cover health costs, then we have the proof that it is a distortion of competition as other states are funding themselves. My question is whether you know that there are studies that moderate consumption of high quality alcohol, e.g. Frankon's wine or Bavarian beer do good to health, and in this respect they could even bring about reliefs to the Swedish state budget. If I understood well, Mr. Posselt referred to the fiscal aspects of the problem. If I am not deceived, the high taxation on alcoholic beverages in Sweden dates back to 1638. Since then, the Swedish state has received a significant part of its tax revenue from the sale of these products. As is well known, there is a state monopoly at this time, which is not in line with Community law. Of course, with regard to the beneficial effects of alcohol - because I think Mr. Posselt has been mentioned - I totally agree with him: I believe that a bottle of good wine is extremely useful for health, but it helps in social interactions, and so we could have a Pos. Mr President, I heard with interest the Commissioner's response to the need for the laws of the single market. I wonder if he can say whether he considers his response compatible with the committee's failure to lead the French government to the Court of Justice of the European Communities regarding the implementation of the French Loi et vin, which in fact prevents the rules of the single market from being applied to the sale of alcoholic beverages. Can we now expect the European Commission to appeal to the European Court of Justice against the French Republic?((()) I would like to answer the question very soon as to the Honorable MP, as this issue is now examined by the Commission.	el
In addition, I wonder about the reduced directions in which the Commission wants to limit Leader +. Mr Commissioner, at a time when, after Seattle, we, the Europeans, are fighting for the multifunctionality of the rural development plans, why are we again trapped in some restrictive criteria with extremely inadequate means? One ecologist talks to you: the principle of precaution, sustainable development, require much more different and much more varied approaches. To this end, the Commission proposes to further reduce the actions of the cooperation of local action groups only in the candidates to be integrated. It would also be preferable, as the Regional Policy Committee also suggested, a greater coordination between Leader + and Community Cooperation and Corporate Relationships, such as Interreg, Phare, Sapard or Meda. Indeed, solidarity with Eastern Europe is beneficial, but it is not enough. We must not abandon the tradition already established by previous programs with the countries of the South, especially those on the Mediterranean coast. For this reason, once again, we can emphasize that what is missing in the agricultural sector and rural development is the co -operation, which would allow us to have the means to be able to promote such programs that require cooperation and have many areas. Mr President, I have some very short observations. We are discussing the new programming period and orientations of the 4 Community initiatives without having a substantial and comprehensive evaluation of the previous period. This is strongly negative. The programs and goals usually appear too ambitious, but the results are not always sufficient, and often the opacity and complexity of the designs leave a lot of scope for mismanagement, even deceit. The Community initiatives we are discussing can under certain conditions play a positive role. However, they need not to submit to the goals and aspirations of a more general negative economic and social policy, but to develop their own independent role. Adaptation, for example, of Equal to the goals of employability and elasticization of labor relationships turns the initiative into a new version of local employment consonants. The extension of the Leader initiative to all areas of the Union encompasses the risk of even greater marginalization of the disadvantaged areas, for the benefit of the most developed. The Interreg initiative is required to include eligible areas with particular emphasis on border, island, mountainous and non -mountainous areas, such as the Arta Prefecture in Greece, which is poorly excluded from Annex I of the Commission's announcement. Mr President, Rural Development has been designated by this parliament and the Commission as a Policy Sector, and I would like to welcome the Commissioner responsible here today, Commissioner Fischler. Our response to rural decline has been overly delayed, but I probably think that is good late than ever. Family agricultural businesses are now recognized as the central point of the European Agricultural Model, and this goal must be of course pursued within the context of the agenda of Agenda 2000. In my opinion, the next five years will be decisive for the future of thousands of family agricultural businesses.	el
In my opinion, in this area it is easy to find out what the Luxembourg process can be learned and declares it to be suitable for social protection. However, I am amazed why you should not talk about public health in this context. It is an important part of social protection, it also takes a lot of money and is a very important thing for many people. Public health is also to some extent in crisis, which is clearly not yet to speak. Mr President, Barón made me a little worried, saying that the program you presented is actually a Social Democratic program. Then I was still thinking about your speech in my mind, and I think that one point was actually very social democratic. It is the point where the macroeconomy is to be organized so that the result is an improvement in employment. Of course, if good macroeconomic policy is implemented, it will automatically result in improving employment. We have seen it. On the other hand, this healthy rule of macroeconomy must not be abused by separating it too much. In fact, in fact, a situation that has been and is still familiar in many socio -economically and social democratically derived households is the case. In the end, employment will eventually be the victim of the wrong macroeconomic policy. This must not happen. I hope that the Prime Minister does not suggest that the macroeconomic policy we have implemented in the past years and that has led to great success, to stop, or to change it somehow so that it would no longer be effective. Then, finally, the Mr President, I have one problem related to the Presidential State Portugal and, in a certain way, to a lesser extent, the Commission documents. The problem is the defensive nature. We have a few countries in Europe, such as Denmark, Netherlands and Ireland, which have been as successful in employment as the United States. So Europeans may be able to do the same. There are also other countries that have been much less successful in this matter. Therefore, it makes much sense to find out why some countries are doing so badly and why in some areas is doing as much as much as we say that we are doing much worse than in the United States. In my opinion, it is generally not fully correct, especially if we take into account that the internal market has not worked until January 1, 1993. It's a relatively short time. Mr President, Prime Minister Guterres spoke convincingly. The proposals made by the Presidential State are distinguished from the usual slang of the community. European citizens do not want theoretical debate, but are waiting for concrete actions. According to Professor Fitous, the biggest deficiency that is currently threatening European society is the lack of the future. Many of our compatriots are afraid of the future that they have been blackmailing for twenty years. Even the lowest accident is presented as an irreversible ecological disaster. Science is often considered to express evil. This has led to fewer and fewer young people focusing on scientific studies. People are required to have flexibility and unrestrained productivity. Europe has become very productive, otherwise its export would not be the largest in the world. However, the dominant speech is the moderation of wages, which still applies to workers. According to the current doctrine, wage increases must remain significantly lower than productivity, otherwise inflation would increase again. The overwhelming winnings in the global financial match apparently do not affect inflation. I'm not talking about stability policy and not necessary restructuring. The implementation of the internal market caused by the euro and the increase in transparency and thus competition still require many adjustments. New techniques change the nature of many professions. Electronic trading removes many intermediate stairs. Most people are ready to accept changes, unless they are always offered only more uncertainty and less social protection. However, Europe currently has all the strengths to restore sustainable growth, which gives an additional basis for include a more ambitious social aspiration for our financial and monetary economy targets.	fi
Therefore, it is important that Nice can make a decision on the Stars of Amsterdam. We have supported the attachment of the Fundamental Rights Book among matters to be dealt with in the inter -governmental conference, so that we can, among other things, ensure the rights of citizens in relation to EU institutions. The fundamental rights book is an indication that the EU is seeking to bring the EU to its citizens. Our starting point is that we must move forward in the work on the establishment of the establishment agreements after the summit in Nice, and that the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights must be part of this project..(DA) The European Parliament's report on the Charter of Charter is characterized by a characteristic: wishful of European Union citizenship in the context of supranational state formation, whether or not this expression should. This passage of thought is clearly different from the view we have from the European community. The Union must continue to be the Federation. Therefore, it is necessary to ensure that the fundamental rights book does not address the national constitutional laws of the Member States or similar systems on fundamental rights. The purpose of this is not to defend the position that authority can act within the borders of their states, but this is the view that human rights are universal and require protection for universal tools. In addition, we do not want the European continent to have two legal collections - one who would apply to EU citizens, the other, which would concern citizens of non -EU states. Therefore, it is very important that any fundamental book of the European Union does not deal with, but rather requires EU countries to sign existing international human rights conventions and declarations. Problems are increasing as the EU is gaining more and more credentials in the state without any obligation to impose on, for example, the European Convention on Human Rights. In our opinion, the matter cannot be resolved so that the EU is linked to the Human Rights Convention as a legal person because we do not believe that the EU has or should have a political identity. Nor do we support the constitutional process to which the acceptance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights is associated with. In our opinion, it would be better for the establishment of the EU authorities to respect the competence and decisions of the European Court of Human Rights. This case -law allows for the judgment of a criticism of a criticism in the law of the Community, which has been arranged when the Member State applied it. The power of the Court of European Communities may not extend to areas already covered by the jurisdiction of the Strasbourg Human Rights Court or other international bodies. If, in our opinion, existing conventions are not sufficient, for example due to the new problems caused by biotechnological development, this is an international problem for which an international solution needs to be found. This is not just the EU, and we must strive for international and global consensus in international forums. Therefore, we oppose the whole report..(FR) We are not refrain from voting on a book of fundamental rights because we would somehow oppose its European character. On the contrary, we are convinced that the future belongs to Europe, which has no borders and whose nations living across the continent are united. However, European institutions, such as national institutions, represent significantly more benefits of large capital than the interests of peoples in general and the interests of the working population, in particular. Democratic rights and freedoms, such as democracy itself, can only be seen only when they are not contrary to the interests of large industrial and financial groups. Whether or not the two institutional developments contained in implicitly included in the Charter of Charter were chosen, these groups can, in all peace, make catastrophic financial decisions for the entire nation, such as the closure of factory and the destruction or contamination of a whole area. For this reason, we consider that a true uniform and democratic Europe cannot exist unless it gets rid of the real power of large industrial and financial groups. This is a necessary condition for nations to be truly democratically supervised by their institutions.	fi
"The measures envisaged in this resolution are however derisory to stop the policy of large industrial groups which abolish jobs and aggravate unemployment.Furthermore, these are only words, because socialist governments, which are mostly in Europe, are just as incapable as right -wing governments to take the measures that are essential to prevent layoffs.The real problem is not to find legal modalities that complicate dismissal procedures a little more, but to prohibit them.The only way to stop this infernal mechanism which produces financial added value in one side and unemployment on the other is to prohibit layoffs in all large companies that achieve profit, under penalty of expropriation, and to make public accounts public and subject them to the control of their workers and the entire population.Company must have the means to impose its own priorities on large companies and their owners, including, in the first place, the eradication of unemployment.The sums necessary to create useful jobs in public services, as well as to finance the distribution of work among all, without reduction in salary, must be taken on the profits of large companies.It is infinitely more important for the majority of the company than waste in financial operations, or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.I cannot support this resolution, because we mention in point 8 the case of an Italian factory whose conservation we wish, whereas at the same time, the current management of the company is advised to try to sell the factory to a manufacturer of European tires.It does not return to the European Parliament to say which factories of the fifteen member states of the European Union it is advisable to keep or close, in which it is necessary to increase or reduce the workforce, whether to keep their current implantation or relocate them, sell or not sell, or, if necessary, to decide if they have to be sold inside or outside Europe.In the end, these are areas of competence in which the European Parliament and its members do not have the legal possibility of modifying a given decision, or even having an in -depth knowledge of the situation that the factory concerned.Swedish Christians repeat that it is important that the European Union and the European Parliament are dedicated to their fundamental mission and that they do not weaken the value of their action in these areas by going beyond their skills.Potential of tourism for employment The agenda calls in common discussion (A50030/2000) of Mr. Viceconte, on behalf of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on Commission Communication: ""Increase the potential for tourism for employment - Monitoring of the conclusions and recommendations of the high -level group on tourism and employment"" [COM (1999) 0205 - C5-01121999/2115 (COS)]., rapporteur."	fr
"We need a rationalized approach to tourism, which covers all policies.I am convinced that we will progress in this area in the future, when we have a good report from the high -level working group, the support of the report of your assembly and, also, when the tourism sector is emerging from business policy.Why is it so important in this sector?Because, in business policy, emphasis will mainly be placed on helping new businesses, how to help young people more easily create their own business.This is where the potential is.If we can eliminate obstacles and reduce the cost of creating a company, facilitate access to financing and modify the attitude of the company so that it has a more positive business spirit, I am sure that the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from it.It is a problem that I hesitate to mention today because I am new in this sector.I worked in all sectors of industry and services but when you examine the organizational structure of the tourism sector, this is almost impossible.It is very difficult for a commissioner to try to work in a sector with dozen organizations whose representativeness must each time be verified.To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, organizations should do what has been done in most economic sectors: seeking better convergence, better coordination and concentration of activities.We could then start a serious dialogue in our daily work.This is the main difficulty that we have to overcome.As for the treaty, the intergovernmental conference began this week and we do not yet know the results yet.I want to be very frank: I have not noted a great enthusiasm as to this conference or as to the proposal to expand the powers of the EU.Tourism is also on the list of subjects which are not among the new areas of competence of the EU.We will see what is going on, but for the time being, this does not seem to be the case.Finally, the Commission is delighted with the resolution that aligns the high -level group, the communication of the commission on the increase in the potential of tourism for employment and the conclusions of the related council.The general agreement concluded between the two institutions in this area should not prevent the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach to achieve our common objectives.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 am.(The session is lifted at 11:45 a.m.) Adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting The minutes of the session of yesterday was distributed.Are there observations?Mr. President, of course, the minutes of the yesterday session will have taken over the interventions on the said ""Strasbourg Declaration"" aimed at involving this European Parliament in considerations which, at the foot of the letter, come to the conclusion that this European deputy is a Nazi.The declaration - which, as I say, implies the European Parliament, although such a declaration has not been made before the European Parliament - is a completely inadmissible manipulation."	fr
Fundamental rights are recognized in our constitution. Member States of the European Union respect fundamental rights. There is a Convention on Rome, guaranteed by the Strasbourg Court, which constitutes the ultimate assurance when there is a violation. So why will this map be drawn up? I believe that the political message that parliament must give is clear: the map of fundamental rights is a plus in the rights that are guaranteed in our constitution. Being a European has an additional positive consequence. So with the map we want is to connect the European institutions to a framework of fundamental rights and the Member States with exactly these fundamental rights when they relocate or apply Community law. This is the political message we need to go through: being a European one is positive; it adds something to what we already have as citizens of national states. And I believe that the report we are discussing today and we will vote tomorrow also makes it clear what the political objectives of Parliament are. We want the map not to just constitute a proclamation. We believe that a proclamation is not enough. Because we want citizens of more rights and more guarantees to enjoy, we want the map to be incorporated into the conditions. Whether or not the map is incorporated in the circumstances, it is obviously dependent on the work that the meeting is able to do. Integration will only be achieved to the extent that the project is useful and can be integrated into the conditions. However, I find it important to take on this political objective at the map of the map. I also find it important to confirm, as it is in this report, that the protection of fundamental rights in relation to existing protection will in no way be degraded. There will be no double work for the Map of the Map of Strasbourg: this is clear. What we want - insist - is to provide European citizens with an additional guarantee when it comes to the application of Community law. In fact, I think by perpetuating the indivisible of fundamental rights, as is done in this resolution, and confirming their innovative character, we are making positive steps to improve the living conditions of European citizens. For this reason, Madam President, I would like to conclude my speech by congratulating both the rapporteurs on the substance and the authors of opinion. The parliament is about to congratulate them, but I want to do so from a political point of view and on behalf of my team, because I believe that Mr. Duff and Voggenhuber and all the authors of opinion were able to respond to the political response to what the parliament needed at this stage. Therefore, I hope, Mrs. President, that tomorrow the vote will ratify the positive work of the rapporteurs with the massive vote of this report. Madam President, Mr Council Representatives, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I think our current venture is taking place at the right time, and reality does not cease to remind us of the urgent need for this map of the European Union to be compiled daily.	el
If we want to fulfill our efforts in the field of foreign policy, the actual anticipation and preparation of all kinds of all kinds, especially humanitarian crises, is an absolute prerequisite. When the high representative Solan last talked to Parliament, I was very critical that he hardly mentioned the idea of ​​conflict prevention;And today he is here among us to talk a lot about the prevention of conflict, even though he has no suggestions for taking it seriously. We have heard praiseworthy that the 60,000 -man troops are ready for 60 days and available throughout the year, but we are currently in Europe, European and elsewhere, and the Union will not succeed in being missing, as such. We really need 60,000 civilian police to try to intervene in these situations. We have not received a high representative from Solani about how strongly the intention is for Russia and Tsetsenia to be taken. We have not heard of a high representative from Solan on what diplomatic measures he or the European Union intends to take seriously, with seriously taken diplomatic measures, to end the bloodwear that occur in Thasenia. At a level of principle, we have major credibility problems when talking about human rights. We gathered capacity to intervene in the situation of Kosovo, and Kosovo is currently slipping completely from our control because we have failed to send appropriate resources, staff and people to handle the situation and have shown our significant inability to prevent conflicts. So I would ask a high representative of Solana to explain to Parliament the position of the European Union on the situation in the Tsetsenia. What serious action are we going to take to stop this terrible situation? We have ways to put pressure on Russia if we just decide, but it seems we don't want to use them. Mr President, Mr President, Member of the Commission, I have two questions for you, a great high representative for you, how can you credibly continue to deepen defense and military cooperation if Member States are not ready to comply with common obligations? All honor to the meeting, but the result is decisive. In addition, I would like to know what kind of plan you have to get the governments to ensure that the 60,000 -man department is realized and will not remain on paper. In reality, Yutp threatens to remain just a speech. An example is the savings of German defense budget - they are not just the concern of the Minister of Defense Scharping, but also concern Europe as a whole. The goal and solidarity of my own domestic Sweden is to set 2,500 men to the EU. Due to the reduction of defense budgets, the Defense Forces would currently only bring together about 1,500 men. If the situation is similar in all EU states, which is not impossible if no re -evaluation is done, we do not have 60,000 men in 2003, but at best there are 35,000 to 40,000. Secondly, I would like to ask the following: A few weeks ago, you were apparently borrowed in German media. However, I would like to know the background of the events, namely, if you have considered the position of a high representative in general that you would handle Austria in some different ways, and if so, in whom, and in what framework would you act? I am very grateful that I had the opportunity to participate in this discussion from a high representative's statement. I'm not going to hold a parliament for a long time, but maybe I could deal with a couple of things and start by paying attention, which is sometimes quite dangerous to any parliament, to the relationship between rhetoric and reality. Member Pack raised the matter, and wherever he is ready to penetrate, I think the others should be so bold that we dare to follow. I would just like to say a few words on this particular subject.	fi
"This courageous position is opening a new page in European building. Return to the roots, in the end, to a community based on the willingness to distinguish a past stigmatized by hatred and exclusion and commitment to the humanitarian values ​​of open spirit and tolerance. Europe was able to raise its stature to condemn the unacceptable. But since it lacks the legal means of this political will - the sanctions provided for in Article 7 of the Treaties are almost inappropriate - will it be able to maintain the stature high against the threat of systematic involvement of all its institutional building? Today, its credibility is at stake before tomorrow's new, even fragile, democracies of the former Eastern Bloc. Europe must now translate its words into works to confirm the eyes of all the greatness of the lost ambitions it has found again. I vote in favor of a joint resolution against neo -Nazis participation in a European Union government, but at the same time I have to express my regret of a compromise that is particularly lagging in determination. I vote for it because I could not imagine that the European Parliament, after the very good political debate it held yesterday, would not take a stand on the issue. However, I personally continue to fight against the far right, gather signatures for a request that requires measures that reach Austria's dismissal and organize a large political demonstration this Saturday at 15.00 in Lili. Fascism and neo -Nazism are carcinomas! The graduate monster woke up! Personally, I think there is no way we can let them grow and flourish without fighting them dynamically. Europe was born from the will for peace, freedom and tolerance. There is no way to tolerate xenophobic, racist and anti -Semitic ministers. Let them not count that I will remain inactive and silent..(EN) During yesterday's debate in the European Parliament, some Members of this Parliament expressed concern about our internal affairs of a Member State. Such a concern is not justified. The European Parliament has always commented on immediate developments in a Member State with which it disagrees. We condemned the terrorism of the Basque and the Irish. We opposed racism and violating the rights of minorities. As a parliament we have the responsibility, especially as a democratically elected voice of the European Union, to comment on current political developments in Austria, which are contrary to the policies of this Parliament. By commenting and sharing our views, we do not prevent any party in Austria from forming a coalition government. It is, however, our right, as well as our responsibility, to tell them that if they go ahead there will be consequences for such a decision, and in reality we warn them. Others will argue that we must postpone our judgment until we look at the details of such an agreement. This view is not only out of place, but also undoubtedly dangerous. The Austrian Christian Democrats, concluding an agreement with JFRG Haider and his party, will confirm their political respect for the far -right and allow them to access power - both will use them as a means of ""launch"" for even greater electoral success."	el
The goal of the current regime was to eradicate the ISA as soon as possible.The reality looks in such a way that the policy of forced emanations could not contaminate the ISA and could not eradicate even less, and while the current regulation missed its goal, it had devastating economic effects for the industry without compensation or the possibility of commercial insurance.There are essentially two changes.The first concerns the approval of vaccinations as a weapon in this fight.This is a necessary change that should go hand in hand with efforts at European level to initiate and finance studies on the development of an effective vaccine.The second change proposal provides for a step -by -step arrangement of fish from epidemics, with the infestation of the individual farms.This strategy has proven to be very effective in Norway, where the number of new diseases has decreased to a handful of cases per year after the disease reached its peak in the early 1990s with 80 to 90 cases per year.I therefore support the changes and calls proposed by the Commission to immediately accept and implement them.I also refer to the problem of compensation and require a change in decision 90/424/EEC of the Council, according to which ISA expressly included in the attached list of diseases.This enables compensation that would be paid 50 % by the Member State in question and 50 % by the European Commission.I thank the colleagues in the committee for fishing for their overwhelming support for my report, and I would like to thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their valuable work.I reject change applications 7 to 13, which were also rejected by the fishing committee.They are either largely superfluous or already contained in my text.In particular, I referred to the need to examine the scope of a possible interaction between breeding salmon and wild salmon, to explore the causes of the ISA and to test the wild stocks more extensively on the virus.These amendments brought by the Greens in the Grünen/Freie European Alliance Group should provide the justification for amendment.This amendment to change is completely unacceptable and inappropriate, since it not only aims to maintain the immediate foreclosure of all fish, but also prevents fish from being sold by affected farms, regardless of whether it is affected or not, and I have to emphasize that no fish affected by the disease is sold.There is no proposal for a change in this, and according to the proposed new regulation, the sale of affected fish is completely out of the question.Change applications 7 to 13 completely ignore the reality that is expressed in the blatant contrast between the situation in Scotland and the situation in Norway.In Scotland there is a draconian regime that has missed its goal.In Norway, where you have much more experience, the 100%exhaustion was abolished years ago, and thanks to a series of measures, the situation has improved immensely.It is all of our interest that in Scotland we also manage to contain the ISA and prevent further spread.	de
During a recent visit to Brussels, the representatives of these fishermen, duly accredited, made the trip from Northern Ireland and were threatened to be excluded from the meeting when they sought to plead their cause from which they had prepared the defense very well.It's scandalous, you have to pay attention to their file.It must be declared it publicly and I want to declare it publicly.I assisted in Reunion during which scientists told us that the Églefins would disappear from the Sea of ​​Ireland and during this very period, the reproduction of the Églefin knew a particular and spectacular increase in the Sea of ​​Ireland.Scientists can therefore be wrong.As I said, all the parties of Northern Ireland agree on this issue and the persons responsible for these settlement on cod quotas should reconsider this decision, the consequence of which can only be the ruin of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland and not the conservation of fish, which will affect all the fishing industries of this union.Mr. President, the reports of our colleague, Ms. Attwooll, are of great importance, as well as being able to have a maximum of data on the fishing sectors of the Member States, all the more so when the obligation for the Commission is closer to developing a report on the revision of the common fishing policy, in 2002. However, the fact that these obligations of updating and sending are simply optional andVery different from each other can distort the final objective of the commission's proposal.Thus, - as we have already pointed out here - it has been highlighted that, within the framework of POPs, the countries which respected them to the letter and transmitted their data to the Commission were strongly injured compared to those who did not respect them or who simply did not provide this data.It should also be noted that the Member States do not all have the same number of data.Some have different sectors and, given the volume of data they must transmit, they could feel injured compared to those who have a less large volume if they are imposed on them the same deadlines.Consequently, in our opinion it is necessary to adjust these delivery times.As we have also already pointed out here, many of this data also have a confidential character because they concern the very competitiveness of the sectors involved and their companies.It is therefore necessary to act with great caution in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.Some of them are inappropriate, as has also been reported, especially those relating to business taxation.Anyway, Mr. President, and as I do not want to expand more, aware of time problems, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms. Attwooll, for the considerable work that she has shot in our committee.I would like to congratulate Ms. Attwooll in my turn and say that I approve of most of her words.I consider as a weakness of the proposal the fact that the establishment of reports is not compulsory within all the Member States.I cannot understand a proposal to establish a regulation that certain Member States could dodge without incurring a fine and I can not understand either within a European Union which is only self -sufficient in fishery matters only 50 %, there is highly sensitive information and that by establishing necessary reports, the national or regional interests of certain fishermen's states or communities are endangered.	fr
This is indispensable for a correct and reliable determination of the deficits.This adaptation will enable a more precise assessment of the deficits and debt levels in the Member States.This technical adaptation will have a very concrete effect on the actual position of the countries, since the data is automatically changed according to the public deficit.I also welcome the fact that the deficits for the 1999 accounting year, which is to be published in March 2000, will already be created according to the new ESVG, that is, that the analysis is based in an economic point of view relevant, consolidated aggregates.However, let me use this debate briefly to appeal to all governments and political parties to do everything so that the procedure in the event of an excessive deficit never has to be initiated.It is good that the procedure exists.The procedure is necessary because it gives our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.The citizens ask: What if the criteria are not fulfilled?With the procedures and other measures, we can prove that we are serious about the criteria and with ourselves.A second essential point is the question that we have to do everything we can not only prevent the excessive deficits, but also have public deficits.I know what I'm talking about and let me say at the end why I'm so happy that we are doing the debate!In my own country we have a debate about whether the information that the former finance minister has given the deficit corresponds to the actual reality.In my own country, in Austria, new elections were necessary in 1995 to fulfill the Maastricht criteria and to persuade the political partner to rethink.I also have to say that in 2000, since so much is said about us, the coalition negotiations with the SPÖ - I say, unfortunately - have failed because the negotiated savings and consolidation program was brought down by the socialist party.Not least because of this, the new government in Austria had to be formed because the ÖVP wants to continue to be a guarantee for the stability course, because the ÖVP continues to ensure compliance with the Maastricht criteria and the reduction of public deficit, as we have agreed here.President!It is gratifying if statistical data are not only reliable, but also comparable.This is particularly important for European integration and the completion of the internal market.That is why we have a politically substantial report here, for which we sincerely congratulate the rapporteur.The report also gives rise to some political comments.The stability pact is a fact in Europe.With this stability pact, all countries participating in the euro have undertaken to strive for a household in the medium term that is balanced or has a low surplus.Of course, this does not mean that in the event of an unfavorable course of the economy, it shouldn't be a little more or less, but a long and medium term must be a balance or an excess.The more solid the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.As a result, an exceeding of the three percent standard will rarely occur, not even under unfavorable economic conditions, at least the reasoning is.	de
The two closely related important resources of the Atlantic coast, fishing and tourism are both severely impaired.In all likelihood, the season will only bring in losses, which would result in a severe crisis at the end of the year.It is therefore completely justified that our parliament accepts a new resolution to which our faction made a very extensive contribution.In it, some points are put in the foreground, which are considered absolutely primarily on site.The first point is that the cause must be fully responsible.In our resolution, the application of two principles is required.Firstly, that of the principle that the polluter has to pay for the cleaning, because it is unacceptable that the cleansing of the coastal sections dirty by a tanker load does not take place at the expense of the owner of the load, but at the expense of the local authorities, i.h.the taxpayer, i.e. the injured party.Second, the application of the cause principle.The responsibility of the polluter is required in our resolution, must also extend to fishing, marine culture and aquaculture companies.This is of fundamental importance and includes that the cause of the compensation of those affected does not depend on the upper limit set by the FIPOL, i.e.h.can limit at the arbitrary discretion of the large oil companies.If the fipol upper limit is not sufficient -and it is obviously too low -it must be raised.This is also required in our resolution.If the raising is still not sufficient, the polluter must pay for the remaining damage himself.It would be extremely unfair if an oil company, which had won 10 billion francs this year, would refuse to pay their victims, who are in the excessive majority of small businesses and employees, 100%compensation.The suffering population, Mr. Commissioner, expects concrete signs of solidarity at community level.The Commission calls on our resolution to take the necessary measures in order to support the damage to the damage in the fishing sector affected by the effects of the catastrophe.Blue Europe, the GFP, today have to make it clear that in addition to the constraints they impose the fishermen, solidarity is not an empty word for them.The European Union must also contribute to the restoration of natural environmental conditions in the affected wetlands and coastal zones, which are of biological importance for the entire Union.Mr. Fischler has just explained that he will positively accept applications from France, which I can only welcome.We have to play a pioneering role in this important question of sea pollution.20 years after the amoco Cadix disaster, there is still negligence and irresponsibility with new oil pollution in Europe.This time the inertia has to be overcome.A general framework in the area of ​​marine safety must be determined immediately, which takes into account the principle of subsidiarity, and the vicious circle of generally widespread irresponsibility must be put to an end.Mr. President, the economy of the French Atlantic coast is badly damaged by the oil pollution due to the accident of Erika.The fishermen, mussel breeders, oyster breeders, tourist companies and the local and regional regional authorities are impatiently waiting for help and the elimination of the wreck, from which oil still exits and is therefore a real time bomb.	de
) Honorable Mr President, the purpose of the Waste Increased Directive is good, but I think that in preparing it we have excessively spent details. Personally, I am more concerned about the so -called waste component. Urban waste undergoing sorting process and layers of fibrous plant waste created, inter alia, by forest industry processes are good fuel for many power plants, always in combination with other fuels. However, this plan is requested to take continuous, expensive, partly impossible and environmental point of view of any necessary measurements for installations that carry out any environmental risks. The end result is contrary to the initial aspirations: the non -dangerous waste that has already been sorted and constitute an appropriate fuel for power plants will end up in the burial grounds, increasing methane emissions, or should be transported hundreds of kilometers away to large incineration facilities. There are many problematic amendments to the exhibition. In my opinion, either the matter should be addressed to the Commission or maintain the Council's common position in its basic principles. Mr President, gentlemen, it is a positive attempt to determine limits to the polluting substances resulting from the cremation of waste, as well as specific control procedures. Indeed, it is not permissible to carry air pollution to water and soil. The Directive is taking positive steps in this direction. However, the inherent problems of cremation remain, as the combustion process itself produces new toxic substances, including dioxins. This is even more true to household waste which contain negligible amounts of toxic substances before their burning. Thus, the single treatment of dangerous and non -waste makes the problem much greater. In addition, the cost of installing and operating the combustion plants remains multiple of the mechanical recycling and landfill units. In short, with the legislative proposal to be discussed the inherent problems of incineration as a method of waste management.) Honorable Mr President, I thank Mr Blokland for this report, whose mission was extremely difficult. The establishment of environmental legislation for the whole of Europe is a demanding venture, and this is because conditions in Member States diverge with each other significantly. I come from a country where the policy on the waste that had already been chosen in the past is in a striking degree with the EU's corresponding policy. As you heard tonight, only Finland has implemented all kinds of effective practice on the subject. For this reason, it is sad to observe that the same mechanisms necessary for the guidance of countries that manage the issue of waste are at the same time forcing other countries that have taken steps on the issue. Things should be different. My colleague Mrs. Paulsen was right: at this point we must adhere to the principle of proximity. If for the use of waste from waste is abusively stricter requirements in terms of emissions than for the rest of the fuel, then they will cease to be used as waste as a waste. There is no alternative use to the waste that by burning them with energy except for their funeral areas.	el
There is no freedom without rules.We have dismissed so-called Master-Feeder structures.These foster funds exist in the United States, but in a space knowing only a supervisory authority and a single jurisdictional system.In the still fragmented European market, such structures would not fail to create problems.Socialists, like the committee, of elsewhere, doubt the opportunity to authorize investment funds to also invest in so -called over the counter derivatives, negotiated programs over the overcrowding.As these operations generally do not fall under prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.In order to supervise the risks for investors, the socialist group has introduced amendments offering safeguard clauses, both quantitative and qualitative.By adopting these amendments, the Parliament will authorize the use of OTC derivatives, while limiting the risks for private investors.Mr. President, we are currently talking a lot about the principle of good governance.This principle should not only guide the public sector, but also the private sector, in particular financial companies.Mr. President, the objective we pursue by creating a framework for SICAVs and other UCITS is to ensure investors the best and as sure as possible.This is why I want to talk about the question of derivatives in my intervention.I am firmly convinced that used with caution, derivatives can make it more safe and higher yields.Despite the risk image they inspire, derivatives are usually used by portfolio managers as a shield.A contract which reports, for example, a large sum in the event of a decline in the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 stock index causes additional payment from the investor in the case of an increase.Is it speculation?Absolutely not.Imagine that you have taken several months to build a portfolio of actions of companies in which you trust: they have good management, good prospects and represent an interesting investment.Then, you fear the occurrence of a collapse of the stock market as a whole like that of 1987. You have the option of liquidating everything against species, but this would ruin the fruit of your research in favor of the winners.This would also imply all the transaction costs incurred by the sale of your shares, then by their repurchase after the stock market cracker.The solution consists in turning to a derivative which reports in the event of a fall of the Nasdaq or the CAC 40. But a custom-made derivative or an over-the-counter, cheaper and perhaps protecting you against a relative loss of your wallet compared to the index, still allows you to keep your wallet and actions, but also to protect yourself against the risks of collapse.In exchange, you also give up market increases.In this case, which is perhaps the one we most commonly meet with portfolio managers with derivatives, you reduce your potential gains but also your potential risks.This is the desirable development of a well -managed fund.Experience shows that investors take advantage of a liberal and flexible approach to regulation.	fr
In relation to this, I observe the amounts available for renewable energy sources, which are not only ecological but are intended to have significant economic boom. When we see the market share that small countries such as Denmark have been able to acquire in this area because they were the first to deal with it, I think this makes us think that in the long run we should really increase the budget for renewable actions. One last finding about the program: I think it is very important for renewable energy to consolidate in the regions in order to grow in the long run and contribute to the economy and the creation of jobs in these regions. In order to achieve 50% or more of all forms of energy to come from renewable energy, we cannot be sufficient in some individual points that will be more efficient in the short term. Mr President, I want to start congratulating Mr Langen on his work. Altener's activities will promote renewable energy sources, and I believe that such programs deserve financial support at the development stage as they offer huge trade potential for the future. For this reason, I find it very pleased that funding focuses on plans for small and medium -sized enterprises. The internationally agreed targets to reduce emissions cannot only be achieved with these programs. We must remember on the case that energy policy remains under the jurisdiction of the Member States. It is imperative for national governments to provide their full support for improving energy efficiency and the development of renewable energy sources. I welcome Ireland's recent announcement that it will spend 125 million pounds on the development of an environmentally sustainable energy sector. I hope Altener's contribution will lead to more initiatives. As stated in the final text, such actions can help to limit regional inequalities. I am able to assert that I already notice a significant interest in the Altener program in my own constituency, in Leinster, a significant part of which is included in the only Irish area that falls into target 1. I support all efforts to bridge the gap that characterizes economic growth in the infrastructure. In short, we are facing a major challenge for fulfilling the commitments we have in the context of the Kyoto Protocol to limit the greenhouse gas emissions of the energy sector, while enhancing the growth of our economies. Altener's contribution will be valuable to the combined efforts of Member States. Mr President, Mr rapporteur, dear colleagues, as our rapporteur recalled, we reach the end of a long and difficult conciliation with the Council on the Altener program. The rapporteur reminded us that the total funding initially proposed by the Council was 74m euros, while the Commission had proposed 81.1 million, an amount that the European Parliament had supported. The first conciliation meeting had failed, as the Council then accepted an increase of only € 1.9 million.	el
"In any event, the result of this inter -governmental conference will be politically strengthened by the European Parliament. There is a very simple reason for this: as agreed in Helsinki, this inter -governmental conference will deal with the fact that the issues that are currently unanimously will be decided will be decided by a qualified majority in the future. Therefore, the number of matters to be decided by a qualified majority will increase. The Community Code already stipulates that the matters that are decided by a qualified majority shall also apply a joint decision with Parliament. Therefore, as the qualified majority will be applied in a broader extent, the joint decision procedure will also be applied more widely with Parliament. However, Parliament would not fulfill its mission as a supranational institution for Europe unless it considered the political image of the Union. This is now the question. In our opinion, the political image of this Union requires that we also deal with other issues, such as those who concern the inclusion of security and defense questions in the Treaty. There has been a significant progress in these matters lately, but they should be included in the establishment agreement. Certainly, the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights must also be discussed, the work of which began yesterday, and I think it has begun in a very positive way. We are going to work seriously so that Europeans can see that there is added value in being European and that the European citizen has fundamental rights that bind the union's institutions. Thus, the Mr President, our proposals we clarify in another report, and the Commission's proposals that he has included in the excellent document and I am pleased to say it here to the Commission member Barnier will be the documents discussed at the conference. However, we sometimes talk about this. Today, we have to show the green light to convene this conference, the President, and the European People's Party is ready to show it. Mr President, I can say on behalf of the Socialist Group that we support the proposal for the statement made on behalf of the Committee on Basic, Rules of Procedure and Institutions of the rapporteurs. We welcome the convening of HVK, precisely because the attitude of Portugal, the Presidential State, has impressed us. It has taken into account our request that HVK's agenda be expanded.""Amsterdam's Ladies"" (Leftovers) is not a very good expression, because things that have not been solved in Amsterdam are very important in themselves. I would call them the first three issues of HVK. These first three things are very important, but they were looking at them in detail in the last hvk. They did not quite reach them, but they really do not need a nine -month extra review. They need a political agreement. Getting an agreement is rather nine minutes behind closed doors, perhaps nine hours if it is difficult, but not from nine months. In this situation, it would be stupid not to extend the agenda. There are other questions that should be successfully considered, especially before the Union expands to so many new countries. No one will ask for December. No one will ask for hundreds of different hvk, like Maastricht. However, there are six, seven, eight, or perhaps nine things that would be very appropriate and useful to look at. Yes, there is time. Remember HVK, who led to the European Unified Document. It only lasted five months. HVK, who led to a huge Maastricht agreement, lasted a year. Only HVK, which led to the Amsterdam agreement, lasted for a year and a half, and it was because everyone knew that getting the result from the HVK required the results of the UK election, so the reason was different. The year is long enough to deal with many questions, and it should certainly be enough to deal with a few key things we want to add to the agenda. I am pleased that the Commission agrees with us. The Commission has just published its statement and made exactly what Parliament requested - made a comprehensive proposal, which also contains the draft articles of the establishment agreement. I thank the Commission for that, though I do not agree with everything the Commission said."	fi
As for the questions and problems asked by the ladies and men and men, I have summarized them in four complexes.First, the expansion of the subject areas.There are four, as well as in the employment strategy, namely employment ability, entrepreneurial spirit, adaptability and equal opportunities.We agree to the expansion of these subject areas in accordance with the proposals submitted by the parliament.Furthermore, the fear was expressed that a country could possibly only use the entirety of the funds for one of the categories affected by discrimination.I would like to reply to the fact that the initiative clearly formulates that the Member States must propose a thematic action for each group affected by discrimination.The second point is flexibility and simplification.I agree with Ms. Lynne - the initiative is really composed in a very complicated and extremely bulky language.The services are therefore already in the process of checking the text, sharing it more clearly and making it easier to understand.As far as flexibility is concerned, we suggest development partnerships and cooperation, both at a geographical level, in which different groups work together in a certain geographical area to eliminate discrimination on the labor market, as well as thematic, that is, that can be cooperated, for example, in a specific business sector.Here the Member States have considerable scope to adapt the development partnerships to their special conditions.The prerequisite is, of course, that the cooperation between the Member States works and there is networking to promote the exchange of experiences.After all, I would like to go into technical support.We strive to ensure that four aspects can be financially promoted: firstly, the preparation, secondly the implementation, thirdly, the interoperability so that there is an exchange of experiences, and fourthly the technical support.Since there were numerous speeches in this regard and great interest in how the technical support is granted, I would like to point out that external offices are used.As Mr. Barnier explained, the Commission's employees cannot cope with the entire work that has previously been done by external employees.The goal is to create large promotional groups at national and European level that are advertised, and a complete description of the project for which external help is required, as well as a detailed description of the product that we expect from the BAT so that the work can be checked and evaluated.Let me underline that it is extremely important to drive this initiative as quickly as possible, both given the political circumstances and because we consider it essential that it starts as planned and that we are now equipped in the end of 2000.Thank you very much, Ms. Commissioner.I will send my colleagues in the Presidium and in the responsible committees to send their wish for a quick naming of the rapporteurs for the dossiers they mentioned.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.(The session is closed at 8.40 p.m.) Approval of the protocols of the two previous meetings The minutes of the session of Thursday, February 3, and Monday, February 14th, were distributed.The protocol of February 3 has already been distributed in Brussels.Maybe that's why some colleagues didn't have it yet.	de
To the extent that the change is possible, with all the tips and all our design capacity, I am sure we have established, or that we will establish a system that will provide complete security to the Union, its taxpayers and this body on the basis of your suggestions. Madam President, the evaluation of the reform process certainly had high criteria, which we need to recognize, though this may be a bit premature. My question is this: An important reason that made the reorganization necessary was to access new countries and the enlargement of the Union. How can we - the Commission, the Parliament, but also the national parliaments of the countries in the world - cope with this challenge with even greater efficiency by taking into account both the ideas and thoughts of the integration of countries? Delegations work actively - this is what I do in my Czech Republic Delegation - but it is found that our behavior is often a teacher. How can reform contribute to more effectively forming the relationship between the European Parliament, the national parliaments and their committee, their cooperation and their joint action? I owe gratitude to the honorable MP because he emphasized the fact that the restructuring, in addition to its inherent virtues, will become necessary due to integration and expanding, and in particular because of the type of expanding that our union will soon be involved. It is essential to have this restructuring, both for the good of the current Union and to facilitate the integration of new states. During the coming years, I will continue the practice I have already begun, apparently, with several of my colleagues, the highly detailed discussions with the administrations of the incoming new Member States. We do this to try to explain with complete fullness the system to which they will join. I would also like to see the enrichment of the training effort undertaken by both current Member States and the Union in general, to ensure that as new officials come to the Commission, and the officials and directors in the Member States will have to deal with the reality, the complexity of the union and the union. Such a level of processing and prediction I would like to see. All I can do now is to promise how to fight for it. Let me start wishing Commissioner Happy Birthday to St. David's Day. Thank you for the presentation. It is important that the Commission never overlooks the fact that the restructuring process will be completely waste of time unless it is reconnected with European citizens. This must really be the clear focus of the process all over. Restructuring must serve citizens, and of course the recommendations to reduce payments to payments I am sure will be very welcome, but the other big complaint that the people we represent about formal processes make.	el
"Third, we are delighted that the common position has introduced, for the first time, the development and regional planning of the coastal areas among the priorities of Life ""Environment"".However, Mr. President, Messrs deputies, despite all his merits, the LIFE III regulation fails in the field which is necessarily the most important for a financial instrument: his budget.By maintaining their proposal of 613 million euros as a reference amount for the period 2000-2004 and taking into account the European Parliament proposal of 850 million euros, the Commission and the Council make a decision which, in our opinion no longer meets the just and rational criteria that they had rightly introduced into the other provisions of Life III.As far as we are concerned, the Commission and the Council must know that we will not give up our intention to provide LIFE with the budget which it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that such an instrument aims to achieve.We justify our opinion on the basis of four very simple arguments.First, Life is the only direct financial instrument intended for the promotion of the environment in the European Union.There is no other.Second, Life is an instrument that has produced good results, which has enabled the development of innovative methods and techniques and its execution rate is excellent.Third, Life's budget has decreased in real terms and has not followed the dynamism and creativity of demand.Fourth, having regard to the credit it grants to Life, the European Parliament has provided more and more important allocations for this program in its annual budget.Also the approval of the proposal defended by the Commission and the Council would lead to an unacceptable reversal of this trend.However, our concern does not focus on the only budgetary question.Climate change and water policy are problems that are very concerned about European citizens and have been the subject of sustained attention from the European Parliament.This is why it is, in our opinion, essential to approve our amendments 5 and 6, which aim to erect the sustainable management of groundwater and surface, as well as the reduction of greenhouse gases to the rank of ""environment"" Life objectives.A final word to congratulate Ms. Lienemann for her report and tell her that we will vote in favor of her amendments on comitology, because, if we prefer, as he has clearly appeared within the Environment Commission, that LIFE's follow -up is ensured by an advisory committee, we do not wish to contribute to the adoption of the solution of the council, which is resolutely less good.Mr. President, dear colleagues, Life is the most important instrument, the only financial instrument, in fact, of the European Union which is exclusively devoted to the environment.This is to say if this tool should live up to our ambitions, ambitions that have a price, of course."	fr
The second way of approaching is to create a law from scratch, that is, to harmonize systems, to completely reshape all the concepts and legal systems in all states. This is not the road followed. The third road we took is ultimately advised to overcome existing systems, which we leave intact, a real fetus of Community law of collective processes and problematic businesses. It is positive and the result has probably exceeded the expectations of editors. But at this stage I would like to make an observation, which is not technique but rather philosophical and inspired by practice. The insolvency is therefore treated in the European Union, in most states, as an event completely decisive for the one who is experiencing it. And I think it is our obligation, in an economy that is moving forward, each one should have their own opportunity and really have it, we have to give a business the opportunity to try both a second and a third time if needed. Today, in many states, this is not possible. One of the reasons that justifies the difference in competitiveness between the European space and the United States, for example, is precisely this ability to bounce on the other side of the ocean and that we do not know. I think that if we have arrived here and if we continue on this course that is the course of creating a collective regulatory process of the uniform difference in the European Union, we must ensure that the allegorical form of the guillotine is not. Mr President, good friends, dear Commissioner, I really believe that it is probably due to the fact that there have been no disasters to date due to the lack of the rules mentioned by the previous speakers. When we look at the bright side of the inner market, that is, the creation of a common internal market, we must also consider its dark side, that is, bankruptcies. I believe we are in front of a historic moment. I congratulate the rapporteur on the rapid preparation of his report. I am also proud that my country has helped to present this regulation, which we now hope will soon be approved by the Council. I believe that the step we take is important, even if it does not particularly affect national systems. However, to the great regret of the rapporteur, I should announce that our team cannot support amendment 3. We specifically believe that it limits the legal status and legal protection of citizens. As for amendment 6, we have tabled a similar amendment under the Commission. I am a little surprised by the fact that the ESK team did not support it. We will support your own amendment 6, but I wonder, as I said, why you did not support ours in the committee. I also hope that transparency will be achieved in this context and that the fastest and better procedures will be compared to the various Member States. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission would first wish to point out that the proposal of the regulation that is under discussion tonight is simply, and primarily, a re -imprinting of the 1995 contract on insolvency.	el
So I ask the Council spokesman, he considers the Commission's chairman right and justified, and does the Council also want to limit the freedom of speech of the European Ombudsman to increase the publication of the documents? In short, Lord MPs: First of all, if this is what this parliament means, we could also answer not twenty, but to thirty questions that the main Members will ask. But I would provide answers in fifteen seconds, omitting the details that I think respond to the presidency's willingness to deepen the issues and offer, as far as possible, a comprehensive and specific answer to the issues that concern the main Members. However, we could, on the other hand, appeal to a bureaucratic, informal, brief and brief answer, an answer that would probably not satisfy. From a quantitative point of view, in the latter case, we could have a success on the issue of the answers we provide to this parliament. I am here through nine in the morning, and I do not think anyone could accuse the Council of not doing his job well and seriously about the answers he has to ask the questions of the main Members. Regarding your question about the controversy between Parliament and Commission, it is obvious that the Council will be the last institution to be involved in this controversy. It will freely allow the two institutions to resolve this potential difference on their own. To simply insist on Mr Newton Dunn's question about the decisions made secret in the Council, could the Minister potentially list the legislative bodies in the world, where the decisions were made secret? Mr. MPs, I would be grateful to you if you re -raised your question because I didn't understand. I apologize, but I would ask you to re -form your question. You said that the Council is not the only legislative body that secretly makes its decisions. I was simply wondering if you could give us examples of other similar rules that make these decisions in the same way. Mr MPs, if I am not deceived, most governments do not broadcast their meetings directly when performing their legislative duties. In all states of the world, the legislative power of governments is generally exercised in closed meetings and closed doors. I do not have the impression that there are governments that carry out their legislative work in public meetings. This is done only in the case of parliaments. And because we have legislative powers assigned to either parliaments or governments, there are therefore two different types of procedures related to the exercise of legislative power. Therefore, as far as I am able to know, in most countries around the world, governments exercise their duties in closed meetings where the public has no access. Mr Seixas da Costa had announced that he would have to retire at 7pm. He also told us that he is working with us from 9am. I believe that today he won his salary as a minister and as the Council's chairman. Therefore, we will close at the time of the questions by expressing our thanks for his presence.	el
I note, finally, that we had asked, since July, an energetic action on the part of the Council and the Commission for the release of the three thousand prisoners Kosovars, Mrs. Brovina, Mr. Kurti and Mr. Hoti.I note that the union is preparing to remove certain sanctions and that in return, we did not have a single release of these prisoners.For what ?Mr. President, the events that occur in Mitrovica, Kosovo, are atrocious and unacceptable.Violence generates violence and revenge causes revenge.The quota of the police forces sent is insufficient to prevent these massacres.The chief police commissioner, Mr. Svend Frederiksen, expressed his despair, specifying that he was always missing more than half of the promised workforce.He has less than 2,000 agents when he had been promised nearly 5,000. The police workforce must be such that it is seen in the landscape, that the population believes that it can stop the violations and it must be of a magnitude such that it is able to shed light on the crimes committed and to sanction the culprits, failing which the door is open to a carjustice.This is why it is necessary to train local police officers, and it was planned that 2,000 to 3,000 police officers will be formed, but the police force still have only 200 agents trained and capable of contributing to investigative work.We have already seen, a year ago, which happens when we do not respect the concluded agreements and the decisions made.I was in Kosovo on October 27, 1998 when the Serbs withdrawn.It had been agreed that 1,800 OSCE observers would be sent to guarantee peace.A month later, they were just a handful.At Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, in the spring, there was still only a tiny fraction of the workforce that had been promised.The violations could not even be noted.Then the war arrived and the observers withdrew.My question is therefore the following, Mr. Commissioner: Don't really do anything to prevent a rehearsal of our nonsense in Europe?Can you not guarantee a strong police contingent of 5,000 men as well as the training of local agents, who could obviously easily elucidate crimes than foreign agents?I will add another question: when do you think they are in place?And when will you delegate more responsibilities to local democratic forces?I ask this last question, because this is the solution that we must consider as quickly as possible so that peace has a chance to settle.Those who are in contact with the reality of Kosovo are of the same opinion: a tragic and desperate situation of democratic emptiness and impossibility of cohabitation between the various ethnic groups - Mitrovica is a tragic example.The policy led by Milosevic in Kosovo before the NATO military intervention was certainly condemnable and the demands for autonomy of the Kosovo regions emanating from non -violent forces of the time of Rugova were justified.	fr
In the future, the financing will no longer take place from three funds, but only from the EAGFL orientation.It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programs, because the EAGFL should be an effective financial instrument.Higher precision When selecting, will lead to a higher effectiveness, because the money should not be wasted without having a plan.I would particularly like to highlight the point that forms an approach to an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.In this area there is great employment potential for the future in rural areas, and we have to use it if we want to show people in the country a perspective.Therefore, politics for rural areas is more than one policy only for the farmers.Leader+ is intended to complement existing programs, avoid overlaps and double financing and thus contribute to the most extensive development.In this way, Leader+, together with the programs of Regulation 1257/99, can underline the second pillar of the GAP even better and have a best possible effect for the entire rural space.President!Dear colleagues!I am not always happy about such a hustle and bustle of parliament, but the Urban program is one of the best examples because it was created on the initiative of Parliament.The Commission would have hired Urban, but in this case the parliament had the longer arm.The continuation of the program is to be welcomed, as it has produced good results at the local level.The problems of the urban areas of Europe are increasing.Fortunately, we are now in agreement with the Commission.Much of the population of Europe lives in cities.The resulting problems are important questions of regional policy that go back to a variety of causes.The risk of infrastructural neglect is great.In many English and French cities there are already slums in which there are incredible abuses.None of us want South American favelas in Europe.We have to act now before it's too late.Cities are also of great importance for the European economy.We always encounter the same basic European problem: our economic life motivates the individual inadequate and is not dynamic enough.We need a strong economy so that we can take care of our fellow human beings and our environment.This is not about politics, but about the simple logic of life.When using the funds, it turns out to be positive to concentrate the means, because the distribution according to the watering can principle seeps away too much in the sand.We now have to accept the solution to the problems in the small and medium -sized cities, since they lack a sufficiently critical mass.This could also give the rural areas surrounding them more development pace.It is often forgotten that the problems of cities and rural regions are related to each other.One basis is always the task of promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, since the mass movement emanating from individuals renews a region from the inside.The granting of financial aid without an economy that is already on its own feet would mean pouring water into the fountain: drinking water would be there for the moment, but tomorrow the fountain will be dry again.	de
The conditions of democratic opposition groups are difficult and not only due to the suppression of the Serbian authorities, but also due to exploitation measures, which are the target of the entire population and also responsible for the international community: exploitation and circumstances that still create new conflicts and generate violence. Today, we want to express our solidarity to those journalists and democrats whose rights have been violated and declare that we oppose the suppression of freedom of press and expression, to which the Miloeviæ Government has been guilty of. The Serbian authorities are trying to suppress newspapers, as well as independent and opposition groups or parties linked. As an example, I would like to mention only Studio B employees who were subjected to under pressure of the authorities and paying hard fines, and in addition, the masked men, which were mastered, destroyed their premises. As a result of these matters, a petition has been made to the Serbian authorities in order to complete their investigations to punish criminal acts, stop growing suppression and change the current law that limits the freedom of the media. We wish the European Union a financial support for an independent press, as well as a grant plan for Serbia to help the entire discouraged population and promote that the Serbian people could finally live normally and choose a democratic government. Mr President, I believe today we are unanimous about this subject and the way the media is treated in Serbia. The situation of Yugoslavia gets worse day by day. It seems that Miloeviæ and his partners are playing a triple game where they try to make an impact wherever they are possible. The tension in Montenegro is increasing. The Kosovo border is very restless and the Belgrade government is creating an atmosphere where major accidents can occur. In recent weeks, independent media has been pressured in many ways. Pressure measures have varied from large fines to direct intimidation. In addition, it is about some kind of internal isolation. It is increasingly difficult to get to the country. I, too, had to be a victim of this politics as I tried to visit the congresses of Serbian opposition parties a few weeks ago. Therefore, I was not granted a visa for the weekend, although two weeks before that, many international guests were allowed to visit the fantastic congress organized by Miloeviæ themselves. This shows that the country strives to prevent external influences in every way. Telephone traffic and email traffic are also restricted and mail is monitored. The government seems to be seeking to expel opposition from local power centers, where it is still in power as a result of the result of the last municipal elections. The new government can win the new municipal elections, which are expected to be held in May only if the opposition is made incapacitated. I think this is a dangerous game. Therefore, we do not only require strict objections to this pressurizer, but demand that the EU is looking for opportunities to support Serbia's independent media directly. They form a very important route for the opposition, which will start working again this spring, and which, in that context, deserves our support, including support for the media. Mr President, it is clear that Miloeviæ has begun a new, multi -mannequinaries in the war against free media. It looks like a somewhat perverse way to launch an election campaign. The campaign has started and anyone who disagrees with Miloeviæ must be closed. Indeed, it is not acceptable that in a country where the opposition is exported from all opportunities to express itself, the elections, the so -called formally democratic elections, will soon be held. This is characterized by a totalitarian administration that knows quite well that free, independent media are difficult and threaten to governments such as the Miloeviæi government. EU Support - which we are likely to agree with two types of two;Supporting the media in the countries surrounding Yugoslavia, which mentioned Croatia and a few other countries, would be a good thing. I support it. However, it can never be an alternative to supporting Yugoslav's media in Serbia, the media that deserves its support.	fi
The common position, adopted by the Commission and then confirmed by the Environment Commission, but which was very difficult to accepted by the Council, satisfies environmental requirements so that I find very strange and incomprehensible that members of the Environment Commission have deposited amendments aimed at reducing environmental requirements and attenuating the responsibility of automakers.If these amendments are adopted, I believe that the credibility of the assembly in environmental issues will be seriously shaken.The Assembly has so far played a positive role as a catalyst in favor of environmental protection, but an adoption of the amendments by Mr. Florenz and Mr. Lange would constitute a negative factor for environmental protection in Europe.On the other hand, if we attenuate the responsibility of producers in this case, this will result from serious consequences in the cases that we will examine later in other areas, for example with regard to the future directive on electronic and computer scraps.This is why I warmly recommend that deputies ignore their membership in one or the other group and to vote against all the amendments to the common position which aim to weaken environmental standards and to restrict the responsibility of the manufacturers.This is how we will obtain a result valid in terms of the environment.Mr. President, this excellent directive will put an end to the discharge of old cars, will encourage recycling and, above all, will encourage manufacturers to design cars that can easily be recycled.The whole thing is to know who will pay costs.Whatever the system adopted, the price will ultimately be passed on to consumers.The best way to achieve our environmental objectives is to make manufacturers our instrument both for the collection of money and for elimination, as well as for recycling cars.The manufacturers brought, using subterfuges, Mr. Florenz and Mr. Lange to offer amendments that seriously weaken these proposals.Do not be abused by car manufacturers!If you want to fully benefit from this directive, make use of your vote to reject these amendments.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, this debate, contrary to what we could think, is not of a technical order.He became eminently political.Yesterday we honored our institution with a political debate.Today, if 314 deputies yielded to the power of the lobby of certain car manufacturers, we would dishonor ourselves.By asking consumers to ensure half of the cost of recovery of out of use vehicles, as stipulated in amendment 38, while the common position requires that the entire recovery is the responsibility of the producer, for the first time, the Parliament would not present itself as the guarantor of the defense of consumers and European citizens, it would in a way become a resonance fund of lobbies.We cannot accept it.It would be a precedent that would leave the door open to all pressures in many other areas.It would also be the first time that the European Parliament has weakened a position of the Council, while in general I believe that we mainly criticize a position of the council.	fr
This way of acting in order to involve all European institutions and citizens is transparent and effective.This white paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement poses to us.This obliges us to re -study the functioning of all our institutions, to re -study our policies -all our policies -, to re -examine especially what we will have to continue to do, at the level of the Union, when we count twenty -five or thirty member states, and what will be more appropriate to do at the national level, at the regional level and at the level of local administrations.But enlargement is not the only one to push us to this new reflection.As I have just said, the globalization of economics and politics itself also encourages us.We have to govern Europe so as to be more effective, closer to citizens, promoting everyone's participation, starting first with the great problem of female participation.One of the major differences that appeared in the comparison made during this period between Europe and the United States is not so much the mobility of workers or the risk problem at risk, but rather the participation of women in economic life, much stronger participation in the United States than with us.This is an area where Europe has always been at the forefront and we must lead to a deep, open reflection, and all institutions - commission, parliament, advice - will have to think of their own role, their own policies.We will therefore immediately get back to work on this white paper, even if we will have to wait for the results of the intergovernmental conference to complete it.It cannot therefore be presented before spring 2001. It will not be a book of philosophy, but a concrete book, rich in specific proposals.We - The Commission - are the first to know that we must completely review our organization.This is why we will do two things: we will employ ourselves and we are already fully employing internal reform, and we will re -study our policies in depth.I asked all the commissioners - and we will repeat this request in an even more analytical way - to define all the activities that can be abandoned.The Commission must determine what its basic activities are, those on which it must concentrate, and give others non -essential activities in order to identify new resources and have a more correct relationship and to achieve greater cooperation with countries, regions and local communities.We will therefore release other resources, but the moment will come - I fear it, and I want to say it here in front of you - where these resources that we are already identifying will no longer prove to be sufficient to allow us to face our new responsibilities.I am thinking of expanding, the new sector of justice and domestic affairs, health and environmental problems.When we have spent all our resources, I will not hesitate to come and ask you for others, but I say today that, we will not accept new tasks if the financial means to assume them do not follow because there would be no consistency between the missions to be accomplished and the resources available.	fr
We are definitely agreeing in the Commission's Community Community actions: Taxation of the sector, that is to say, taxable measures that we can provide to this industry - which, as we remember, is formed by 95 % of small and medium -sized enterprises, corresponding to 2 million tourism companies in the tourism industryqualification, in other words, invested in education;And finally, you have to commit to the openness of the labor market. The tourism market is definitively flexible;We would hope that this flexibility would not only be negatively understood and stumbled upon the misconception that seasonal nature means irregular work: we remember that 50 % of employment, above all, in the southern states of the European Union, have atypical work. We consider that the European Union and the Commission must strongly commit to sustainable tourism, which means creating a sustainable environmental strategy after the overtime of recent years, when private wealth accumulation was often not followed by an increase in employment. Competition must be followed first and foremost in terms of quality. Finally, we consider that tourism can be not only a growth factor but also a democracy factor, and we ask the Commission to act determined and systematically. Mr President, I want to talk about three things. The first is to include the legal basis in the establishment agreement. It's something I do, even though I currently represent a minority in my group. We are all fully aware of the importance of tourism for both the local economy and European integration. However, some of us consider the problem of not being legally founded and how it should be accurately proportional to the principle of subsidiarity is precisely defined. Secondly, there are similar issues to develop a multi -year program. The resolution has many excellent ideas on promoting new forms of tourism and its increasing professionalism. At the same time, however, the Commission is now considering how it could limit its mission to the most important issues. You have to ask whether some of the actions proposed in the resolution are more affected by its resources than desirable. Thirdly, there are several references to sustainable jobs in the resolution. Of course, promoting them is desirable, and sustainable jobs do not necessarily need to mean full -time work. However, there are always people looking for seasonal work. Students are a good example. We suspect that the resolution does not pay sufficient attention to them and how their interests could be particularly protected. Although we congratulate Viceconte for his report and even though we have found a lot of support to be supported in the resolution, we will therefore ask for more than one point voting so that all these aspects can be addressed.- (FR) Mr President, I also think that tourism will play a very important role not only in Europe, but throughout the world, because it is a significant asset of economic and social development. But it is also a very sensitive vulnerable industry, we once again stated this in the oil plate. For example, an ecological disaster of an oil board can destroy completely flourishing tourism. Thus, we can now do anything and anywhere in the field of tourism today. There are considerable protected areas and some areas, rural areas, so-called development-behind areas, which still have wild nature, together with nature reserves have been classified as areas with attractive tourism potential that could be called eco-tourism or green tourism. This could be developed and could be a very important source of new jobs. But these areas really need to take into account the positive and negative experiences gained in other tourism sectors. In fact, one should not kill the gold -like egg egg eggs. Tourism must respect nature if we want it to be the asset of the future and also remain. I think of several mountain areas, the situation of which is constantly impaired and thus cannot be developed in the tourism sector.	fi
Ireland supports the common point of view as well as many of the amendments to the European Parliament.A period of 25 years for the implementation of legal provisions is hardly acceptable.We have no problem with the enforcement of the pollutant principle to cover the costs for industrial, commercial and agricultural water use.Since life means life and access to clean drinking water is an elementary human right, I am firmly convinced that this guideline must enable free basic supply of private households with water, i.h.A certain contingent per household for water for drinking, cooking and sanitary purposes.Of course, we have to pay for waste and excessive consumption, and the cost recovery can be adjusted accordingly.In Ireland, where private households have not paid water fees since 1997 and therefore no more water meters are installed, you look at the introduction of water meters with great suspicion.The measurement of water consumption could be a very important instrument of water management as part of the new river area units and make a contribution to preventing water waste as well as the systematic planning of future needs.The purpose of the guideline is to promote the permanently environmentally friendly use of water in the EU.Water is a brief and valuable natural resource.It would be best for me if the application for change does not get through 45 tomorrow and the common point of view of Article 9 also applies to water fees.This would give the subsidiarity in the determination of water fees, and each Member State could set up their own system, provided the principles of this guideline in relation to incentives for permanently environmentally friendly and efficient water use remain comprehensively preserved.If change application does not fall 45 tomorrow, I have to bring in an oral amendment to ensure that the Member States have the opportunity to issue exceptional permits on the provisions of this article and thus enable the provision of a minimum amount to use in households before the cost recovery requires.All regulations must be enforceable and based on the general principle of political acceptance.I consider access to clean drinking water both in the developed and in developing countries for an elementary human right.Mr. President, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!At the current state of pronunciation, I would like to highlight some aspects that I consider from the perspective of agronomy and because of my origin from a southern country in this guideline for extremely serious.For example, the topics of the costs and transfers.As for the costs, I would have liked to know exactly what costs we speak of.Are we talking about the distribution and origin of the resources?Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?Are we talking about the type of structural conditions required for care?Or are we talking about the large hydraulic buildings and memory pool?Laving the entire costs back to the agricultural sector would be barbaric.As for the transfers, they are defined as the transmission of surface water between the different territorial areas.Is the commissioner known that we have a transfer system in our country that is one of the oldest of Europe?These transfers already existed in very early epochs: they already existed in the times of the Romans, they were only less.	de
"Meanwhile, we have to pronounce a vote of trust from the Commission.""Far -heavy"".I don't want to go into the scope of this report here.I do not know whether he breaks the record of all the resolutions presented here, but definitely and without any doubt with this type of resolutions.I do not believe that there has been a decision in the past - and keep in mind that we develop complex resolutions in this parliament - in which paragraphs of more than 16 lines were contained without one point.He is also ""unclear"".I don't want to come back to what was said about the analysis of the questions that affect the parliament.This should be the subject of another report that we have to work out, and it is necessary to think about it, but not in this report.And in the end, frankly, Mr. President, I don't want to give any examples, but there are many in which the legal language is used with an alarming inaccuracy.Therefore - and I summarize - I expect - we are many who are waiting - their report, Commissioner Kinnock, to express us, because this is the task of Parliament.President!The scope and detail flood of the suggestions for necessary reform steps indicate the importance of such a reform.In view of the events that triggered these efforts, the need is also obvious.Hopes and expectations were all the more awakened by the strong announcements of the Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in the plenary and in the budget control committee.The concept of transparency is particularly noticeable in the report.Ensuring this is a main concern.The importance of complete work can not be emphasized enough.But it is not just about a bureaucratic reform, but rather about the demonstration of good will towards the citizen.His trust in the EU policy must be recovered.The citizen raises the right to quick and open access to the institution and the readability of the regulations.He draws his understanding from it, and he wants a policy of success and at the same time sees this as a self -evident service in the responsible citizen.The success of the reform depends significantly on the commission's initiative.However, it irritates me when I hear today that the Commission now says that it only wants to discuss the interim report with the parliament.Her lecture, Mr. Kinnock, in the budget control committee next Tuesday, not only a one -way street can be, but we as a parliamentarian want and must help shape.And it also goes against my political understanding when a press conference takes place this week before we carefully discussed the template in the responsible budget control committee.I think Mr. Kinnock, despite all personal success: the Commission still has to do a lot to meet our legitimate high expectations.I can initially carry out for the protocol and as an explanation for Ms. Langenhagen that the decision that I will not speak in front of the whole parliament tomorrow and will therefore not be available for official inquiries about the report was not made by me or by the Commission - it was the decision of this parliament!"	de
First of all, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as well as its rapporteur, the President of the Commission, Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, for having examined the commission's proposal.The commission's proposal is, as some of you have pointed out, quite technical.However, the objective is quite simple: the harmonization of the procedures governing the authorization of additives in the food.At present today, there is a difference in processing of authorizations, which is a function of the moment when the requests were submitted, namely before or after January 1, 1988. The objective of the commission proposal is to harmonize these procedures in order to guarantee that such differences are no longer.The object of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.Five amendments were presented by Parliament.I regret that the Commission is unable to adopt these amendments despite the fact that I am well aware of the opinions and the commitment of the Parliament, the Commission of Agriculture and, more particularly, of the rapporteur, Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, as for these problems.I intend to review each of the amendments separately.The first amendment proposes to modify the legal basis of the proposal by substituting article 152 for article 37. I simply wish to point out that the commission's proposal does not refer to health and consumer protection.The technical nature of the proposed amendment does not allow it to be interpreted as the primary objective of the protection of public health.I note that the legal and internal market commission also considers that article 37 constitutes the appropriate legal basis.I remind parliament that the primary objective of article 152 is the protection of health.I recommend that you read the arguments set out in the letter emanating from the Legal Commission, which describes the situation, in my opinion, with precision, clarity and with commendable conciseness.Amendments 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission's proposal, given that they tend to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.I am the first to recognize that GMOs are a very important problem.I also recognize and concede that a certain number of initiatives are necessary in order to update the legislation of the EU in the field of GMOs.However, this technical amendment is not the right instrument for the introduction of such initiatives.The Commission is of the opinion that it is premature, at this stage, to amend the provisions currently established by Directive 70/524 concerning genetically modified additives.On the other hand, it is appropriate to wait for the developments relating to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently second reading in Parliament.The Commission plans to go much further than what is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.I can also guarantee in Parliament that I will ensure that the relevant provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal to reshape the 70/524 directive that the commission proposed in the white paper concerning food security and which will be presented in Parliament before July 2001. I can also ensure the Parliament that all the remarks made today will hold our attention.Amendments 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they grant an unjustified preference to copies of products by giving them the authorization to be put into circulation even before a request for authorization has been submitted.	fr
Now, however, it seems that the other issues, that is, the remaining twenty percent, are so difficult that the weather is going through and the negotiations have already been led to a deadlock. So I would like to ask that in fact the Chinese are not willing to recognize the same negotiating position as in US representatives or what is due to the fact that the balance - the queues - twenty percent do not end up unanimously. Good question. I claim the paternity of this expression: 80 to 20%. It is used to understand that much of the route indeed has already been crossed, since what is taken by someone who has negotiated before you, you receive it thanks to the clause of the rather favored state. However, there is a remuneration, a 20% remarkable lady for very simple reasons. In a bilateral negotiation, everyone tries to focus on the points where it is less competitive and it is understandable that it leaves the rest to others. For this reason, for a certain number of issues, the United States has entered into with the Chinese a bilateral agreement we also benefit from. But in some places this agreement is not as favorable to us as it would be if we had negotiated it ourselves. This is a first reason. It is for us, as far as possible - and with that I do - to act, so that what is a generally good agreement between Americans and Chinese is a good agreement for Europeans. Hence this 20% - it's only 20% - but you know that in a negotiation are often the last percentage units that make the whole difference, and we are at this point. There is another, more technical, reason that imposes some subtle differences. For similar names, there may be very different tariff classes. I take the example of alcohol: Bourbon and gin are not treated in the same way as whiskey and brandy. While all these alcoholic beverages are seemingly the same, there are cases where tariff classes are not the same. These are more technical issues, but which necessitates a detailed examination and negotiation of all these aspects. The case is not fully over. I noted that I would go to Beijing in the last week of March to try to regulate the true difficulties in my opinion in this negotiation. This is the political part of which the Chinese authorities expressed a series of reservations. I have the order to overcome these reservations for the time being, and I will try to do so.. Thank you very much, Mr. Lamy. We completely exhausted the time set for Mr Lamy. Consequently, question no.46 will be answered in writing. Questions to Mr Fischler. Since its author is absent, question no.47 becomes invalid. Question No.48 of K. (H-0173/00): Subject: The cost for agriculture from enlargement according to the latest studies and estimates what will be the cost and what are the consequences of the forthcoming European Union for agriculture?	el
Our additions, therefore, require practically applicable strategies of interruption of plans, so that not only can we have the necessary assurance against the ongoing costs that often burden the taxpayer, but also avoid the well -known syndrome of continuing unnecessary money. Finally, we are calling for a change in balance and method by which the credits are spent. There should be greater involvement of the private sector, which will introduce economic reality as a perspective in balancing credit. Also, the type of funded plan needs to be shifted from small -scale revenue -based plans, which are difficult to control, to capital plans where, in the majority of cases, the benefits are visible to everyone. In this way, the much -publicized need for transparency in the use of these credits and the temptation to move forward in the long run, without being necessary, to establish local tax in the areas where these plans are made will be reduced and the European Parliament will show how seriously it takes the need for such a reform. If the body today supports these changes in the report, I think they will push us to the next phase of achieving the historical goals that the credits have been planned to bring, that is, to assist - in a stable manner - those disadvantaged areas of the European Union, which need to go up to a decent, decent level. I urge the body to support these changes. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, gentlemen, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur on her report, which is a painstaking and serious work. There is no doubt that the structural policies and the policy of the cohesion of the European Union are the key tools in creating the conditions for the development and reduction of the economic and social inequalities of the regions that, despite the steps taken, remain at high levels of unemployment, at unacceptably high levels. For the highest degree of achievement of the goals of these policies, it is necessary to coordinate and organize them on the basis of well -processed, smart, guidelines. Let us not forget that these policies when they are effective are also visible to the beneficiary European citizen, who immediately sees the improvement of his quality of life. Let us also not forget that a particular emphasis should be placed on the remote and island areas of the European Union because they encounter key obstacles to their economic and social development due to their geographical location, unless the Commission intends to build bridges or underwater tunnels for their European tunnels. In conclusion, I would like to point out that structural policies as a whole need more flexibility to adapt to changing circumstances and thus respond to the new challenges and opportunities that appear with the arrival of the new millennium, for which we all wish the best. Mr President, no doubt Mrs Schroedter's report contains several important observations and I congratulate her on it. But I think we should worry even more about the orientations and results of the regional policy of the community.	el
"The question of women's presence in decision -making sites is above all a problem for democracy. All citizens, women and men, must be able to recognize themselves in the elected persons and the authorities and feel that they really represent them. Given that more than half of the population is women, but that their presence in these places is still significantly less than men, it is clear that we are far from real democracy. However, it is also a political agenda: in addition to the fact that women form the majority of the population, they are also the most dynamic part of society: they have most contributed to the creation of new companies in Europe in recent years;Most young women find work in so -called atypical employment;Many of them are characters from the development model of innovation, education, merit and flexibility. In one sample, 90 % of women who work in Milan, my hometown, in the area, have stated that they do not have enough time for everything they need to do during the day. Women work on average 60 hours a week, 20 % more than men. The price that women pay in order to hold on to their wishes and be key characters in all sectors is the scarce syndrome. If this is true and it is true in good politics to start to find this positive solutions to these problems. Thus, it is necessary to implement well -built, adapted and daring tools related to legislation, programming and participation in order to enable new dominant classes in culture, economy, society, institutions and politics, categories of the feminine characteristic of modernization. There have been a lot of issues in Europe for many questions, but we are still far away in the balance of representation. I agree with a member of the Commission that European politics in European politics is time to show signs of women and men, and that this field would thus be crucial. Mr President before I came here to the session I watched Finnish TV. There, the Finnish Army's honorary company greeted the new President of the Republic, saying, ""Good day, Mrs. President of the Republic.""You may know that in Finland the president is not only a director of opinion, but he is also the Chief of Defense, so this was quite an interesting and historical situation. During the Finnish Presidency, a report showed a picture of the entire decision -making picture, and based on this report, I hope that a member of the Commission will indeed propose legally binding ways to improve the position of women in decision -making. I urge you all, dignified right -wing women, to listen to Mrs. Lulling because she told why quotas are needed, and if she has enough experience of political life. Finally, I would like to say that it is now essential that we will also get this question to the inter -governmental conference. I appeal to you, dear colleagues, do not vote tomorrow for the proposal, which will relieve paragraph 4 so that gender democracy would not be dealt with at an inter -governmental conference. Mr President, Mr President, Mr. Member of the Commission, of the Gender and Due to the complaints of all the timely gender-based inequalities and discrimination, the reviews presented in the resolution still have the original causes of these problems, which are therefore necessary to change policies in many areas of operationsdecision -making. We know that it is this area that has proven to be the most difficult, whether it is because women's shoulders still fall for the main liability of family life, or the fact that there is still prejudice and front issues that make it difficult for women to participate in many areas of greater responsibility."	fi
"According to Oslo, a total of 17,400 hectares of land were expropriated by October 17, 1999, including 846.2 hectares under the new Barak government.Trees have been uprooted, other houses were destroyed, and in East Jerusalem, the use of water is restricted or it is denied, while the settlement activity continues and the number of settlements is constantly increasing.However, the election of the new government undoubtedly meant positive steps, at least the negotiations were resumed.In the Middle East, however, there will be no stable and permanent peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state and if they cannot move freely within their territorial area.The international community must simply meet the UN resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.We consider the suspension of relationships with Syria to be worrying, as well as Prime Minister Barak's decision to postpone the Israeli troop deduction and the implementation of the Agreement of Sharm El sheikh.In our opinion, the European Union must play a political role in the negotiations that corresponds to the economic aid it has achieved.We must not be content with an extras role, but have to appear as the main actors without getting into a conflict of interest with the United States, as Minister Gama said today.Mr President, I would like to thank Commission Member Patten for his current explanations, in particular for his report on the role of the European Union in Peace process and the assurance that this role is not only limited to that of the ""financier"" for the entire campaign.I was very disappointed when it became known this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria were interrupted.I very much hope that a compromise will be found with regard to the existing problems, so that the peace talks can be resumed as soon as possible.Nevertheless, positive political developments in the Middle East have recently emerged.The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister recently sat at the same table in their respective history at the talks in America shows that hatred and animosities, however old they may be, can be overcome.The responsible politicians have to raise a lot of courage to create a framework that can form the basis for a comprehensive peace solution in the Middle East.It is clear to me that even after an agreement between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will encounter strong resistance to any further agreement with Syria in future referendums.The settlers on the Golan heights will request compensation and security guarantees.If Syria were ready for concessions in the security question, the prospects for a successful solution to the problems between Israel and Syria would be good.As for the Palestinian question, there are still problems with the implementation of certain aspects of the WYE agreement.The key problems are currently the difficulties of troop deduction and returning areas.The fact that only a few Palestinian prisoners were released and the Israeli government obviously hesitates to stop the implementation of already placed building permits and to refuse to issue new permits.These problems clearly hinder the progress in negotiations on the final status, even if I do not believe that these conversations can be delayed endlessly."	de
"There are therefore two possible solutions: the guideline is not applicable in Denmark or the guideline is due to introduce Denmark to introduce generally binding contracts.Can the Commission reaffirm that the directive on the posting in Denmark is not applicable with regard to the ""collective agreement declared generally binding"" (see Article 3 paragraph 1), since there are no such generally binding contracts under Danish law?If not, I request information on how the guideline is to be applied on this point.The European Union's guideline on the posting of employees stipulates that the mandatory regulations in relation to the working and employment conditions in the recording country must also apply to employees who were sent to this country.According to this, two options are conceivable: either the legal provisions of the reception center or the collective agreements, which have been declared generally binding for a certain branch, apply.Because there is no system of the collective agreements declared generally binding in Denmark, the legal provisions for the implementation of the directive, in addition to the working conditions specified by the legislation, must also be provided that the generally binding and most representative organizations also apply to collective agreements that are sent.In short, Denmark has two options: either it introduces the corresponding legal provisions, or in turn it in turn selects a collective agreement in a legislative manner that is activated in a legal way.Talks are currently taking place between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the implementation of this directive in national law.The deadline for answering the Commission's questions expired on December 6, 1999.We have no answer.We are now waiting and seeing the next steps.Thank you for the clear answer, which - if correctly interpreted - amounts to the fact that the guideline on the posting of employees imposes a system of general contracts to the Danish state.This is a clear answer, but I would like to point out that a politically very difficult situation arises for the Danish organizations, the Danish government and the Danish parliament.As is well known, there are fundamental differences between the Danish system, which is largely based on collective collective agreements, and the continental system that is based on legal provisions.The disagreements and the correspondence they address, Ms. Commissioner, primarily refer to another guideline, namely to the working time directive.Now a new deadline for deadline and a contractual procedure is to be expected, since the Danish government does not intend to adopt laws and enable generally binding collective agreements or have expressly pointed out that it does not want to do so.At least there is the intention to change the system applicable in Denmark or any other country.As I have explained beforehand, there are always difficulties with the interpretation of the European Commission's guidelines because they only set one frame and are very general, but also because the individual systems are designed very differently from country to country.The problem mentioned in your request does not only affect Denmark.A few questions are not only open there.Five countries have already implemented the implementation in national law, in the rest of the discussion process.It is therefore true - this is our goal, and therefore the consultations and the pronunciation between the Commission and the Danish, but also the other governments take place - to be able to use what was decided by all countries at European level and to be able to apply to the employees sent to Denmark from other countries."	de
It is about the affirmation of a European cultural policy with regard to which I expect from us, Parliament, Commission and Council, which we are in agreement.Who says cultural policy says in particular defense of the role of creation, recognition of authors and production of a demanding culture.Even more, today where Europe must have a new policy for the rights of authors and neighboring rights, it is urgent - it has just been highlighted several times - to define and redefine what an author is.We are still too vague in this regard and new technologies now impose this clarification effort to us.Mr. President, the Commissioner, the advent of the WEPI Treaty was remarkable progress to a global information company.The heritage of copyrights, which is old, crystallized in the treaties which represent a balanced and well thought out solution for copyright and neighboring rights, is crystallized.In addition to these recommendations, the entry into force of the treatments and final form will however depend on the respective application of the parties.In the United States, the OMPI Treaty has already entered into force by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and this legislative measure made it possible to safeguard the delicate balance of the OMPI.The EU must also move forward in its legislative work in accordance with what has been agreed to the OMPI.It is therefore concerned that the positions of the previous parliament do not support the balanced organization of the OMPI.The first reading of the Copyright Directive was particularly aberrant and, moreover, we are changing the balance in a bad sense from a European point of view.The proposed recommendations will not improve the position of culture in Europe, quite the contrary.The modifications proposed by the Parliament would especially improve the possibilities of media companies, having a stable position on the markets, to transfer their old market share of more than 80 percent to a new environment using a rigid and excessive regulation of copyright.So I'm not talking about the recommendation of Ms. Charlotte Cederschiöld, which is an excellent document, but many themes related to copyright and which have been dealt with by the previous parliament.As an isolated remark, I would therefore like to thank Ms. Cederschiöld because she has clarified, for example, the concept of the said temporary copies in her opinion.In the OMPI Treaty, we did not consciously take a position on temporary copies.If these technical copies were part of the protection, data transmission - as it is clearly seen in the recommendation - would become without any expensive and complicated reason.It would be the same situation as if the factor had to pay copyright when it brings a book to the customer who will read it.The real advantage of culture is being able to transmit art and information, safely and without difficulty, directly from the artist to the user, to the consumer.The new framework of action is above all a huge possibility of creating and disseminating culture according to new methods.	fr
In addition, request can be placed directly between the responsible authorities, without the path to be necessary via central authorities.There are basically two types of provisions: those that justify an obligation to provide assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and monitoring telecommunications;And those who do not justify such an obligation, but only have a legal framework, for example, the provisions on common investigations, hidden investigations and the transfer of procedural documents.The Commission particularly welcomes the admission of provisions that relate to new or modern investigation techniques.When combating the form of crime, they are efficient that can most likely benefit from the opening of the limits of the organized crime.It is only too easy to guide you from the need to improve the efficiency of criminal investigations.However, an aspect must not be forgotten in all measures in connection with criminal proceedings.I very much welcome that the report by Mr. Di Pietro, whom I for his excellent work, in addition to this in such a short time, tend to be the greatest respect, contains the right to defense as one main point.At the moment it is only due to the Member States to ensure that these rights are respected under the examination of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Charter of Fundamental Rights in which the work has just started.We have to admit that Article 18 clearly deals with a controversial decision.The article was carefully developed in the Council in very long discussions to ensure that secret service activities remain efficient and that criminal investigations are covered.As far as the criminal investigations in my responsibility concerns, I take the request to take this point into account by various members of the European Parliament to the Commission and the Council and to deal with it on a common legal basis for reference to the relevance of monitoring telecommunications as a possible evidence in court.The Commission is completely aware that the present design is neither perfect nor ideal.But we have to be realistic.The text is the result of a mixture of institutional structures that are intended for the Justitial Cooperation in Criminal Matters according to the Maastricht Treaty or that of Amsterdam.This is now up to us, and practice alone will show us in detail whether and where there are defects and what further steps will be taken in the future.It is quite clear to me that the further development of mutual trust and the mutual reliability between the legal systems of the Member States will make it easier to advance on the way we have before us.Apart from that, the European Council in Tampere has specified the direction to be recorded by the Commission.The necessary steps will be the realization of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the euro justice project.The Commission sincerely hopes that its efforts to progress in these important areas will find the support of the European Parliament.	de
"It's a shame!This figure of 167 million euros for as many years, is a shame for the European Union!We are literally obliged to strip theatrical groups, young musicians, avant-garde activities in the field of arts and letters, we ridicule them and we accept a single project in the face of thirty other discussions, so that Europe is felt as a foreign, contrary, and adversary factor in any attempt at cultural accomplishment.The European Union must respond in this area, because the path we have chosen is not only that of the euro, or enlargement or that of geostrategic purposes.We must ensure that European unification also flourishes on a political level.It is a very sad situation.And as long as we continue to keep the unanimity system, and, as yesterday, the government of the Netherlands can impose these 167 million in a completely arbitrary way, and that, as tomorrow, Mr. Haider's government will tell us what our cultural activities will be, we will never be able to progress.For this reason, it is essential for the intergovernmental conference to make certain important decisions for the effort of the European Parliament to be released from the commitments of each government and can give a significant cultural impetus to the European space.Madam President, I fully share the opinions expressed by the rapporteur and also thank the president of the Culture Commission, Mr. Gargani, for laudable work shot in a substantially difficult mediation process.The requirement to simplify and strengthen the previous programs was made, of course, to feel, but we all wanted the culture program that could actually contribute to exalt, for example, the peculiarities of each cultural sector, even - and I would even say especially - less known sectors, or better, of these precisely.We hope that this will happen at least in the evaluation scale.We believe a lot in the validity of cultural actions, also in terms of contribution to the social and economic growth of a people.And Europe can rightly compete with the rest of the world by fully rediscovering its roots, highlighting the common cultural heritage, by valuing and recovering the cultural and linguistic islets so far little known.In the case of the great educational mission relating to the cultural dimension, a mission that the European Union must assume, one of the most obvious limits of the program lies in the quantification of financing - we have heard it on several occasions - which denounces an insufficient awareness - at least from the Council, not of the Commissioner - of the importance of the cultural operation.The document which puts the economic factor in a priority position in relation to social integration also testifies to this.With regard to the global growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens, we believe that the ""Culture 2000"" program, within the limits of its funding, can contribute to this great common objective.Madam President, I join the unanimous movement tonight and declare to support the adoption of the 2000 Culture program. In addition, I also thank the rapporteur, Mr. Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague, Nana Mouskouri."	fr
"However, after Cardiff and Luxembourg, an important merit of this summit is to show the political will to promote stronger social cohesion, in particular in favor of the 57 million who live in Europe, such as single mothers, large families and children, to which further socially excluded, namely those who will have no access to the new areas of knowledge, which will lead to new social inaccessions.A decidedly future-oriented economic and social policy is therefore required, so that no ditch between ""info-rich"" and ""info-arm"", that is, as one of my colleagues said earlier, no digital gap is created.For this reason, in my opinion, the new technologies will only assume strong integration impulses for our growth if they are learned from childhood, because by 2010 half of the jobs will belong to sectors that are directly related to information technologies.For this I recommend that three decisions are made on the Lisbon summit: first, a strategy of lifelong learning and the definition of an agenda to remove both the economic and intellectual poverty of children;second, design of European society with regard to the European research area;Third, determination of an open coordination procedure associated with our social and economic policies, supplemented by a coordinated procedure in the evaluation of the national action plans.President!My dear ladies and gentlemen!There is an idea in the explanation of the Portuguese Council Presidency, which I like extremely.This one idea is the idea that the strength of our European economy is in performance, imagination and creativity, simply in the knowledge of people in the European economic process.However, if we take this seriously, if the really political program is to be, a policy of social inclusion no longer requires any further justification because social participation as such would be the strongest productivity of our common economy.If so, Mr. Council President, we need common goals.We need fixed goals that we make measurable - in qualitative as in the quantitative sense - about increasing the employment rates, as has now also been proposed by the Commission.We need fixed, mutually agreed goals about the reduction of the unemployment rate - as has now also been proposed by the Commission - to 4 % in 2010. It must be concluded with the logic that the Ecofin Minister is celebrated at home for consolidation success, but the responsibility for the question of huge unemployment in Europe is in the fog.I wish you a lot of strength, the support of Parliament and the commitment to the fact that this parliament has more to say in the questions of economic and employment policy in the future, as is expected by the citizens in Europe.Then they would have another ally for their politics.President, Mr. Council President, Mr Commission!It is gratifying and promising when this plenary - as was the case here - is talking about the new strategic goal for the coming decade: to make the European Union most dynamic and competitive economic and social space in the world by being able to use new technologies, innovation and knowledge so that we are able to do the level of economic growth with more and better workplaces and larger social workplacesto increase."	de
But, on the other hand, unlike the Haarder report, which we voted for this morning, this is an entirely demagogic report that lacks legal power. And the parliament, which is a co -coomination, must be aware that any of its own opinion has legal value or, as in this case, quasi -legal value, and therefore should act with more care. Let me give you only one relevant example: paragraph 22, which is requested to give substance to European citizenship, granting the right to vote in European and local elections to third -country nationals residing in the community. Obviously, this paragraph is opposed to the treaty from the outset. Is not properly worded. And I could mention more examples like the one that justifies our abstention. Mr President, I would like to present a brief statement on behalf of the Austrian delegation of the Social Democrats. We have approved this report because we believe that despite some of her wording is a good report and I find the characteristic characterizations given here in some voting justification. In paragraph 10 we were abstained in the vote. We would prefer a statement that corresponds to exactly what the European Parliament has decided in its resolution on Austria. As long as this paragraph was approved, we also approved the report as a whole due to the generally positive tendency it expresses.(In) My team and I are pleased to vote in favor and supported the Ludford report on the important issue of combating racism and xenophobia. Those who voted against the family unity, the encouragement of ethnic minorities to participate in the elections, against a political force that reflects Europe's diversity and against the multinational nature of parliaments must be condemned and condemned. Members of the British Labor Party and the European Socialist Party team voted in favor of amendment no.2 For the deletion of paragraph 17, not because we are opposed to the specific feelings and intentions, but because it left room for possible misinterpretations or ambiguities. The fight against racists and xenophobes in our society, those who seek to divide Europe, is a battle in which we must defeat and defeat. We moderate support most measures against racism and xenophobia at the Ludford exhibition. However, we abstain from the final vote, because we believe, contrary to what paragraph 17 demands, that the law on the labor market is an area where the principle of auxiliaryity must be implemented. The Ludford report on the fight against racism and xenophobia, as well as the Haarder report, presented at the same time on human rights in the European Union, seem to have been occupied by a wicked spirit that, in addition to the legitimate protection of the rights associated with human dignity,Either the national or even the European. One has the impression that each other and the other are ambitious to defend the rights of an undifferentiated person who can reside anywhere on the planet, and not the rights of persons with the date and place of birth, heirs of a tradition, holders of their own values, and we are of our own values,	el
"Finally, let me thank the rapporteur, Mr Berger, for the special care of examining the various amendments, thus giving it a special value in its report. I am in the opinion that this report has taken another step towards the implementation of the internal market. Mr President, thank you for offering me the opportunity to be particularly involved in the various amendments. During my intervention I would also like to say something to Lord Inglewood on the occasion of the observation he made a while ago. As for the first proposal for employees from third countries, the Commission is willing to adopt amendments no.2, 11, 12, 15, 16 and 22. We consider acceptable amendments no.7 and 8, provided that the secondment in the Member State is found to be detected. The Commission also agrees with amendment no.11, except for the proposed period of previous employment for only three months. I explained this before. We also agree with amendment no.13 To the extent that it contributes to the expansion of the scope of the bulletin by one to all Member States. In terms of commissionology, amendments no.14 and 21 are accepted to the extent concerning the rights of parliament. After my regret I must say that amendment no.10 cannot be accepted by the Commission for the three -month period and the role of the Member State of destination. In this respect, the Commission supports amendment no.22, as I noticed before. The rest of the amendments cannot be accepted. I personally like the term ""EU Service Card""?proposed in amendment no.1, however, the Treaty of Amsterdam does not allow this. The amendment no.18 refers to Directive 96/71 on the basic salaries, which is already in force and as a result does not require any modification. If the Commission accepted the amendment no.17, this would mean that a simple reference obligation would be sufficient if no valid bulletin was issued. This is contrary to the interest of public order in the Member States. Based on my justification for amendment no.10, I find it non -admissible and the amendment no.19. The Commission has the same view of similar amendments to the second proposal. I would like to add that the amendment no.10 on this proposal is perfectly accepted. As I noted earlier, with regard to amendment no.15 For the definition of the concept of ""freelance""? The Commission will make sure to find a satisfactory solution to the objections raised. I am now coming to the observation of Lord Inglewood, who referred to border controls that still exist in the United Kingdom. I would like to tell him that no Member State - and therefore not even the United Kingdom - is obliged to abolish or modify controls at the existing border. As I said, this is true for the United Kingdom. Of course, it also applies to Belgium, where a problem has recently occurred. Regarding Mr Karas' observation, let me say that I have the impression that it is mentioned in the case of the possibility of working in Poles in his country."	el
Initially, I point out to you, Mr. Byrne, that Parliament has no right to initiative in legislation. But when you propose amending a directive or regulation, we claim our right and we consider precisely the entire regulation and not just the section you have chosen. In our amendments, we were nevertheless limited to formal harmonization with other instructions. We even omitted the content issues. We did not come out eg.on the issue of antibiotics. Therefore, the question is only to harmonize the legal provisions in the individual guidelines. My question, Mr. Byrne Commissioner, is as follows: At the recent UN Conference in Montreal it was accepted that international trade should be marked on genetically modified organizations. Do you really believe that it is possible for parliament to allow - when it now has this ability - not to impose this marking for additional feed on the European Union? Mr Commissioner byrne, you are aiming for a confrontation with parliament. We have negotiated for the circulation of seeds for two whole years. So I'm glad for the discussions we are going to have with you. I would like to emphasize that no GMOs have been approved in the context of this Directive only applies to additional materials. I would also like to mention the marking issues that this is a complex issue. It is examined and will continue to be examined extensively, especially in the context of Directive 90/220. This issue is at the present time, and there will be other instructions that will deal with these guidelines will also have as a legal basis for Article 152, which assigns to Parliament full competence in the fields of the Competition. I will assure Mr Graefe Zu Baringdorf that in no way do I intend or wish to conflict or clash with parliament on this issue. My intention, as always, is to work with parliament and to ensure that we achieve the best results. The best way to deal with this issue is through the legislative plans that have currently been submitted to Parliament, as well as through the legislation under elaboration rather than through this technical document and in conditions under which the issues set and will be discussed under Directive 90/220 may not be taken into account. It is better to wait for the conversation, which I think will take place very soon. All these issues will be examined under this legislation.. Thanks, Mr. Commissioner. Parliament keeps your observations under note. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.30. Terrible Disease The Daily provision provides for the discussion of the Report (A5-0023/2000) by Mr. WFGE, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal of the European Parliament's Directive and the Council concerning the amendment of Directive 91/68/EC of the Council on Terrorist Disease (1998).- 1998/0324 (COD)). Dear Mr President, Honorable Mr. Commissioner, Mr WFGE's report on measures to combat contagious sponge veraphics belongs to those issues based on the proposals submitted by the Temporary Inquiry Committee of the European Parliament for the sponges. In this committee, the rapporteur, Mr. WFGE, did a valuable work, and we feel relieved to see that the BSE Committee was entrusted to him within the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, because Mr Bfge has experience.	el
We will not fail to focus all our attention on this problem because all the credibility of the authorities and the representative structures of the Albanians in the field also depends on their ability to prove that they are capable of applying measures guaranteeing the multiethnic nature of the territory.I would like to thank Mr. President in office.I have in mind - like all of us, I think - that Portugal, his former president Mr. Soares and his government observed a circumspect and moderate attitude during bombings in the Balkans.Today's political declaration on this issue is very positive, I emphasize and congratulate myself.Despite everything, a concern arises, because if, on the side of the European Union, the intentions are good and sincere, the results are very thin.Unfortunately, lately, we have been witnessing the disappearance of all the minorities - Serbs, Roma, Turks, Croats, - Kosovo and we wonder what will happen.We note the failure of the United Nations mission and Mr. Kouchner in Kosovo.Because it is a failure that after a whole war waged to avoid an ethnic purification, there is a purification due to the other edge.This is why I repeat my question: does the Council intend to take more concrete initiatives to tackle these questions with Mr. Kouchner, on a very large part responsible for the situation that prevails today in Kosovo.Mr. Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you have just said, with your last sentence concerning the responsibilities of Mr. Kouchner and I would like to make a very important distinction: the structure installed in Kosovo is a structure under the supervision of the United Nations.The European Union gave it all the possible support and the countries of the European Union, as such, contributed to it in different ways.But it cannot be denied that Mr. Kouchner's efforts in order to normalize the inner situation of Kosovo are extremely positive.Regardless of the fact that you can estimate and that we too estimate that certain results of these efforts, for reasons which exceed Mr. Kouchner, could not be as effective as we would all wish it.It is necessary to make a distinction, on the one hand, between the question of the responsibility of the European Union and, in particular in this case, the possible action of the Council in this context and, on the other hand, the responsibility of the international community as such, which has the general supervision on the situation in Kosovo.The responsibility of the European Union is therefore part of a determined context.It is towards the international community as such, in particular the United Nations, that it is necessary to turn to the responsibilities of implementing resolution 12/99 and in particular as to the logic underlying this resolution and the compatibility of this resolution with reality.These are questions that we must ask ourselves, but it is within the framework of the United Nations that we must ask ourselves these questions.	fr
"(Ppe-de).(Es) Madam President, I would also like to applaud the Commission's initiative to present to us a report on its strategic goals for the next five years, although I hope that it intends to correct, in future documents, the excessive generalities and indefiniteness of the text we are considering today. Lady, Mrs. President, I am again intending to make a voice in the desert for the absence of a fishing policy. It is really surprising that the Commission does not set a strategic objective for the coming years the process of revising one of its common policies, in view of the reform to be carried out in 2002. This review process is undoubtedly the most important event of the impact on the fishing sector for many years. However, this is not the case for the Commission, which has undertaken to present to the Council and Parliament before the end of 2001 the report on the operation of common fishing policy in the last decade, on the basis of which the Council should make the appropriate amendment decisions. Indeed, the review process has already begun for many bodies and institutions, such asFor the European Parliament, which already in 1998 drafted and approved an exhibition, which highlighted all the problems and shortcomings currently facing common fishing policy. We have repeatedly asked for an elementary timetable for this review and we did not receive an answer. And less than two years is not a long time, even when we must remember that common fishing policy is facing an abnormal situation in terms of the rules of the internal market and these abnormalities should be resolved in the context of this reform process. Consequently, Mrs President, Mr President of the Commission, I ask this issue, vital to a very important European Union, to take into account this strategy and these strategic goals for the next five years. Madam President, I would also like to express my congratulations on the program of Commissioner Mr. Prodi. I particularly applaud the fact that it recognized this ""virtuous cycle"" of sustainable development. Information society in the expanding European market, along with a fully -operated single currency that will enable us to truly promote prosperity, innovative businesses, business spirit and, yes - most important of all - to promote sustainable jobs for all of Europeans. I would like to make an observation, and not criticism, of the statement by Commissioner Prodi this morning: this statement seemed a little weak in terms of the actual content of economic policy. We must not consider anything given the way we can achieve the restructuring of the European economy. Why in the end, what does social justice mean if there is no full employment? Full employment is the best way to have social justice for our citizens. This is the key priority in which we need to focus our attention."	el
But let me start with the first one. In Mr. Poettering I would like to say that we are not trying to double anything. This question was raised by many parliamentary MPs. We are not trying to double anything. We are trying to do as much as possible so that the European Union has the potential to act in case of need and at the same time the overall security of the European Union, the countries belonging to our alliance, to be maintained and secured. We do not attempt to create a European army. Anyone who said that is wrong. We do not attempt to create a European army. We try to create the potential which, when concentrated in case of need, will be able to prevent tragedies like the ones we have recently experienced. It is very important to talk about prevention. It is very important. I can tell you, and you know, that the prevention potential already exists in the Union. We don't have to devise it, it already exists. Isn't echo a prevention service? Is our ability to act diplomatically is not a prevention capacity? What we did not have at all was the ability to act at the other end of the crisis management spectrum. In the end, the European Union will be the most important group of countries that will be able to deal with problems related to crisis issues, from humanitarian crises to the development of military forces. Either in Mozambique or in European countries if needed. In a few days, the European Corps formed by European countries will grow in Kosovo, not to wander around, but to prevent people from being killed. And I would like to tell my friend Mr. Cohn -Bendit that at this moment, 45,000 troops from our country - not from any other country - the majority from our country - are growing in Kosovo - to do what? To prevent people from being killed. Do you really believe that because we are lining up soldiers we are going to change the minds of people who have been suffering for centuries? Do you even imagine for a moment that because we are lining up soldiers, is it going to change the psychosynthesis and minds of people? How many centuries will it take to change the mentality of the countries that fight with each other in moral, psychological, even on a natural, level for years? Do you really think that by lining troops on the ground, people's minds are going to change? Soldiers can prevent people from being killed, but they cannot guarantee that people will love each other. It would be fantastic, and really for me the most important gift would be to be able to develop European powers and make people love where they were killed before each other. Unfortunately, even with the potential I have, even with all the jobs I have supposed to have, even with the little sleep, this is impossible to achieve. However, let me also tell you something. Even if we handed out police officers, as you requested, this would not solve the problem at all. Do you honestly believe that EU countries' police officers would solve the problem in Mitrovica?	el
I want to approach another fundamental democratic question without eyeshadow.As a member of the Assembly who has just started his work on the Charter of fundamental rights, I mean in complete clarity that, for my group and I, a solemn proclamation of the Charter is not enough.What would the citizens say if they are solemn rights but that they cannot assert them individually?No, I think that would only more like the credibility crisis from which the Union suffers.For all of us, low participation in the European elections should be a sufficient alarm signal.What we need are perceptible rights by all, the charter of fundamental rights must take on a legally binding character for all those who live in the Union, for all citizens.In the interest of the latter, we should work in concert at this objective and I expect from the intergovernmental conference that it reviews the Cologne decision in the matter at the end of the year.Naturally, there is also talk of the effectiveness of decisions and the functioning of institutions in a union expanded to 27 members and more.We will not succeed by a mini-reform such as that envisaged by the Council and that is why it would be necessary to submit all the institutions to the test bench.We must undertake courageous changes while attaching the greatest attention to the balance between large and small member states.I particularly insist as a representative of a large Member State.I thank the commission for the proposals it has advanced and I am convinced that there will be, within this Parliament also, in -depth discussions with the citizens on all the questions they will have raised.I would still like to tackle a last question.The opinion of the Parliament expressly claims changes to the treaty in the field of economic policy.Indeed, economic globalization and above all the introduction of the euro and the supporting stability pact make it necessary to probe the decision -making processes.But that's not all.It is above all necessary to have the courage to carry out a critical examination of the policies carried out so far by the Union.It is a Europe full of social justice.A Europe full of social justice remains more than ever because it is above all a question of placing the fight against mass unemployment and poverty at the center of the policy of the Union.To do this, it is also necessary to have the courage, in my opinion, to modify article 4 of the treaty which defines the Union, in the classic line of neoliberalism, as an open market economy where competition is free as well as article 105 of the CE Treaty, because the European Central Bank must finally respect the mission assigned by the Treaty and which consists in promoting, by its monetary policy, sustainable growth and employment.Mr. President, the Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference, as defined by the Helsinki Council, that is to say strictly centered on issues of decision-making in an enlarged Europe, must be respected.	fr
The Mr President, how political decisions are made, is certainly a very important thing. Yesterday, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and his Foreign Minister told how they view the Council's voting system. They pointed out that the UK, France and Germany currently have a much higher population than in other European Union countries. On this basis, they concluded that the size of the population should be taken into account in the voting system and that the United Kingdom would not give up its traction right. Does the Council deal with this issue? Is it ready to preserve the democratic traction of the population, or is it continuing to move towards a simple majority voting based on the number of council membership instead of a voting method that reflects the Democratically represented European population? Have the representatives of the United Kingdom inform the Council about their decision and proposal, and has it been treated in any way? Since this voting issue is vital for the Democratic Future of the Union, it should of course be discussed primarily. How to make decisions is essential. Mr President, this morning's conversation is quite important. That is why I would like to thank the Commission and the Council for making a statement on the consistency of community policies in development cooperation, as it is a demonstration of a desire to enhance policy in this field. However, this is completely frustrating for us and, in addition, negative, if we only map the inconsistencies of our policies. As in the natural laws that are studied in the basics of physics, there is no mind to launch each other opposing policies. The result of such an insane game is not zero, but has a negative effect due to the waste of material, economic and human resources due to useless effort. In politics, such a negative outcome is multiplied by the results that have not been achieved, whenever one action is invalidated by another action. In the current world of global worlds, such reality is even more obvious. There are also no limits to community policies either. That is why I am pleased that the Commission and the Council are once again interested in the consistency of community policies and, with these policies, seek to guide European Union development policies with national and community policies and coordination between the Commission units. Both the Commission and the President of the Council Portugal include their work plans a desire to gain consistency in policies that have a significant impact in developing countries, but do not explain more detailed the concrete measures to achieve this consistency. Both institutions have identified the most important areas to which this aspiration must be applied. For example, in its long -term guidelines, the Commission mentions that the goal of sustainable development must become a strong solidarity that is supported by a trade policy that takes into account common interests. The Commission refers to a very important field, that is, trade policy. In the Parliament, we want to add the following policies on development aid, agriculture, fishing, migration, the role of international monetary institutions, common foreign and security policy and structural support. This morning, the Council has already spoken to the mouth of Minister Luis Amado for the last time in November 1999, but also at other events such as May 1999 and June 1997 on Development Co -operation meetings, but no concrete results have been achieved. As we agree with him about where he or the Council who was considering development cooperation ended, which is quite important, otherwise, as the member who had previously held his speech. On the other hand, we want to propose as a parliament, as well as said and presented in the resolution, the establishment of a working group of units, which would consist of all the persons responsible for all of the above policies, and the establishment of a monitoring center on the consistency of different community policies that could predict the impact of each policy in developing countries. However, in reality, we want to be realists and we know quite well that the achievement of these cooperation and complementary goals, as well as the most intermittent goal we are currently dealing with, that is to say, consistency, requires more advanced policies in the European Union today.	fi
Namely, if the forests continue to harm the forests until now, the local people will be the first to suffer and then all of us on the whole globe, as there can already be dramatic climate changes. It is now also very important to us that the projects can proceed without interruption. For example, what we demand from the Council is not about any requirements for wind, and I believe that skillfully negotiating can progress, as the conditions can be met. Otherwise, we can only agree with the colleague Fernández Martín's report;What has also said that the colleague Scheele and others have said is entirely in line with our line. Many thanks to other members of Parliament for this great timeout. Mr President, good colleagues, the state of tropical forests must be worried in two ways. The impoverishment is not only quantitative but also qualitative. The contribution is the biodiversity of our planet. Thus, the Commission acted at the appropriate time by making a proposal for a new Tropical forests for the Council Regulation, and I fully support the reviews proposed by the rapporteur, the rapporteur whose proper and sharp work I am recognizing. He opens up interesting views and would like to deal with them a little more for a few points. I think it is of paramount importance to consider the scope of the regulation. First of all, projects must be better focused on the renovation of tropical forests. However, the 1995 Council decree may have focused too one -sided on the protection of tropical forests and did not emphasize their potential productivity. In addition, future activities of the community must take into account all aspects of sustainable forestry. This requires respect for indigenous peoples dependent on forest ecosystems. The intention is to remember that the essential participation of these vulnerable peoples encounters significant obstacles: these forest areas often have unrest and conflicts, too often, in these areas, have unexpected consequences in these areas, and are also obstructed by local forest laws that are not subject to situations. Although there are forests that are protected from all production activities, but there are also forests that are kept in financial activities. This is the case of the European Union's forests, and I ask you, good colleagues: Where was community support for European forests when the storm destroyed them last December? Of course, the challenge presented in this report must be accepted, but it is also necessary to draw up a real policy of communal forests and sustainable care..(EN) I hardly need to emphasize how important the tropical forests are worldwide, as they affect climate conditions, most of the world's biological diversity, and millions of people in developing countries also make a living - firewood is a good example of this. For these and other reasons, European citizens are reasonable to expect the community to support the preservation and sustainable care of tropical forests. I talk about tropical forests, but in fact, this regulation is new compared to the previous regulation that it now covers all developing countries and thus such as South Africa, China and the Mediterranean and Middle East. In addition, the regulation refers, in particular, to the needs of indigenous peoples and the forest -dependent population and the need to take into account gender -related aspects. We have just discussed the Environmental Regulation, and the remarks I made at the time of some sectoral issues are also largely suitable for the forest regulation. For this reason, I speak very briefly. As regards the reviews in Fernández Martín's report, the Commission has the following position on key sectoral issues. Guidance: The Commission approves a compromise of EUR 249 million proposed in the review for seven years. Commitology: In principle, the Commission supports 11, 14, 14 and 15 of the verification of the checks. The revision proposes a dividing commitology procedure in which an administrative procedure would apply to annual guidelines and primary objectives, while the Council would investigate projects of more than EUR 2 million in the advisory procedure.	fi
"This is therefore at least one step forward.The second criticism that we formulate is that the system was too restrictive vis-à-vis the commission.We adopt legislation in the European Union.We expect the commission that it applies them.And from that moment, a system intervenes to hinder the commission and make its work more difficult - in particular, that was the case of the so -called ""counter -filet"" system, thanks to which the Council could block the Commission through a simple majority, even if the council was unable to find an alternative to the execution measure concerned.In this area also, we are progressing at least somewhat.The Council will no longer be able to block execution measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period, unless a qualified majority has been reached to block the measure, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States within the Council.It is a more reasonable system.This is also a step forward.However, with regard to the other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.The first criticism relates to the system by which the Commission is monitored, examined, controlled if you want, by a single committee appointed by the Member States or the Council and not by Parliament.The legislative authorities, namely the Council and the Parliament, should be equal.We confer executive powers to the Commission but only an body appointed by the Council or the Member States can put the off, say no to the Commission and put an end to an execution measure.Parliament does not have equivalent power.It is true that we now see ourselves granting the sketch of such power in this new system.We are supposed to receive all the projects of execution measures sent to a commission at the same time that they are sent to this commission.We will have the opportunity to examine it, debate it and ask questions.However, we will only have the right to challenge the Commission if we believe that it exceeds the powers that we have given it in the legislation.In other words, we can contest the measure in case it exceeds skills but for its content.And in a democracy, parliament should be able to contest the content.I’m not saying that we’re doing so every week.We are not trying to immerse ourselves in execution decisions but the fact that we should have the opportunity to do so the rare times that it is necessary constitutes a democratic safeguard.This is what is missing in this system or, at least, which is only present in an embryonic form.Finally, our fourth criticism is as follows: if an execution measure is blocked through the comitology system, it is returned, not to the two branches of the legislative authority but only towards the council which has the right to take, possibly, an alternative measure.It is not correct.The two branches - Council and Parliament - adopt the legislation which gives execution powers to the Commission.If such execution measures are returned, they should be to both branches and not to one.In general, we have a system that has improved somewhat.The additional aspects arising from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council."	fr
I believe that if this is accepted in Lisbon as such, the Lisbon Summit will be a success. If this is not accepted, the Lisbon Summit does not really say much more than before. As far as this is concerned, this report is actually part and perhaps the most important part of the Lisbon Summit, because it is really new, while many other things are just beautifully re -heated things that we have brought up before. Above all, I would like to warmly thank the rapporteur and also the Commission for this report. I hope that Europe will take a step forward in the area of ​​social protection, following the principle of the subsidiary, because without it it will not succeed. Dear Member of the Commission and Mr In Merry Colleagues, I would like to thank the Commission, like my colleague Bartho Pronk, and thank our rapporteur for his work for this report. The fact that this report is no longer controversial to Parliament does not mean that it is not very important. I have experienced many times that such discussions about social protection have actually been difficult in this Parliament. The conversation also begins at the right moment - Pronk said it just recently - that is, at the moment when we are fully preparing for the Lisbon Summit, where we need to look at how we can take economic growth, employment and social cohesion on the agenda in Europe through the information society. It is self -evident to my group that social protection is an important part of social cohesion and that it must also be taken on the agenda in Lisbon. My group is delighted that at the end of last year the Social Affairs Council showed a better collaborative strategy than the green light, and that in addition, a group of high -level officials has already been tasked with presenting the first report to the Council by June 2000. However, as a parliamentary group, and in particular as a group of the European Social Democratic Party, we would like to go to Lisbon. It is very important that the European Parliament requires this colleague's report to a genuine community strategy for social approximation, according to what has been implemented through the so -called Luxembourg strategy through employment through common goals, guidelines, national action plans and performance. In our opinion, this goal is ambitious but still accessible. Of course, it is clear that the harmonization of social security at the community level is not a feasible idea. Financial systems and other systems are too different for it, which is also an important reason why social protection has barely been on the European agenda and why the prospects for the future, such as Danny Peters' 13th Member State or European Social Slang, have really hardly been realized. However, this new goal is particularly interesting. The employment strategy has shown that it can work and that social approximation is also necessary, as our social security systems are facing the same challenges, and because during EMU, social security systems are otherwise threatened with part of social competition. I would like to say one thing in the name of my group: strategies for social approximation must not be an alternative to social legislation. They can only act as a very useful supplement to what we develop and what we expect from the Commission on social legislation. In my opinion, it is also good that the European Parliament also tries to convince the Council that a common strategy should have its shape already in Lisbon and that it should be launched by an annual procedure in early 2001 to reduce poverty. I am delighted that the European Parliament supports this idea of ​​my group, and we hope, the consignment member of the Commission that we can also receive your support. Then, finally, we demand that the European Parliament, the social partners and the social organizations of the social sector be closely included in this process.	fi
Member of the Commission Wulf-Mathies and Bjerregaard, due to a letter sent to Member States on June 23, 1999, requires that the design documents of the 2000-2006 season shall provide a stable and irreversible commitment to ensure that the programs comply with the rules for the protection of the Natura 2000 areas. Member States are required to report the areas within the agreed time if they have not already done it and to officially confirm that they will not take any action to damage any Natura 2000 areas. The Commission will then take advantage of all the means available to ensure that the commitments presented in the design documents are fully followed. It intends to monitor the situation of the Member States, including the inspections on site. In the Committee on Monitoring of each program, the Commission's representative also seeks to ensure that the commitments of the Member States on the Natura 2000 program are fully followed. In addition, if the Member State does not respect its commitment to submit lists under the Habitat and Bird Directives within the time specified in the design documents, the Commission shall immediately take action. Such measures are, in particular, - with the exception of certain specific situations and, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity - a possible resort to the provisions of the regulations on structural and cohesion funds for the suspension of fees. Of course, all of these actions will complement the ongoing violations of the Member States who have not implemented these directives. In summary, today, at the Commission, we decided to demand that Member States provide us with their Natura 2000 list: they should have already been submitted, as stated several years ago. We resort to the means available to us to ensure that they respect their commitments. Without these lists, it is impossible for both Member States and the Commission to ensure that we protect important wild areas in the context of structural fund actions for the simple reason that we do not know where these areas are located. A few more words about the habitat directive. The Commission does not agree that this Directive would not be clear enough. The Directive is intended to introduce a framework for the detailed implementation of the Member States in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. The Commission has no plans to review the directive, but its units are willing to provide Member States guidance on its implementation and we are finally getting started. The only areas that the Commission considers under the Hanoration Directive are those reported by the Member States' authorities. The so -called shadow lists can only help to identify the areas within the Member States. At the community level, they can promote the creation of scientific reference material by mapping wild habitats and existing species. I thank you for investigating us, but we are very disappointed with what you just said, because we had given the impression that the starting point of the previous Commission was a simple principle: no lists, no funding. Now you are rolting this principle, you turn to the Member States again and ask them to submit lists. They are really late. They completely neglect the Community directives. It is still unknown whether you are going to introduce the technical, legal and political means to help Member States comply with the Community Directives. Therefore, I can well imagine how Member States keep this new position as a mockery, as they have had more time, while nature conservation is increasingly harmful. As we look at the studies prepared by the European Union, the European Environment Center, we find that the environmental degeneration continues. So I ask the following question: When you accept a community project today to support Portugal, have you demanded a list of protection areas under the Directive? Mr President, my first report on the parliamentary was exactly what today in the center: the environment and the Structural Funds. Of course, I ended up with the basic management decision that the actions funded by the Structural Funds should by no means concern the environment of the Member States and that for this purpose, the importance of the environmental dimension must be strengthened at all levels of program planning and implementation of the Union.	fi
So what do we have to do now? I don't want to go back to the past at all. I want to look into the future. What do we need to do now? I would like to tell you one thing we have to do. Of course, we need dual -caught ships. Obviously, but it is something that affects the situation only in the medium and long term. So what do we need right away? We need technical control of ships, namely the binding technical control of ships every other year, which no ship may be operated without any ship. This is what we need at European level and we need it internationally, such as Tüv (German instance corresponding to Suomen Autokstus Oy) and motor vehicles, which must be done every other year in Germany. If the car owners do not have a test certificate, they will not be allowed to drive their car. This is what we need for ships. Thirdly, we need the control of this inspection certificate and insurance certificate in the ports, namely in every port of the European Union. If there are no certificates, the ship will be stopped and may no longer leave the port despite all port fees. We must be unanimous in all the ports of the European Union from Marseille via Rotterdam to Wilhelmshaven and Cuxhaven, and where the ships ever differ in the port. Fourth, we need the liability of shipowners, not only a ridiculous $ 12 million sum, but at least $ 400 million, which the shipowner must place per insurance certificate. Then we need the obligation of the country that the ship operates under the flag. We need the assurance that the country under which the ship operates under the flag will take responsibility in the case of an unclear case. This is going to be excellent control! I can guarantee you that then the countries that grant the right to use their flag to ships also make sure that they are not held accountable. Fifth, we need a guarantee that this is required of all ships in the ports and regional waters of the European Union, otherwise in the applicant states. This means that these requirements I mentioned apply to all water bodies. Finally, we need the most important thing: we need a good memory as we will talk more often about legislation here in Parliament soon. We will talk more and more about environmental standards. I don't want someone to come here and say: These requirements lead to we lose marine jobs. Trade organizations come and industry is coming. We need good memory, good colleagues. Here I look at many of you who have not so far represented the top of the environmental movement. Once upon a time, go home and say, we haven't worried about the standards so far. We need good memory when it comes to what is required in ports. We need good memory when saying: We are unanimous about port fees and port requirements and we do not play in the European Union against each other. When we do this, things may be better in a couple of years! Mr President Roth-Behrendt, a member of the Parliament, highlighted several of my thoughts. We have now received a complete list of different actions. But how do we use the crisis awareness that this ecological disaster has created? I compare this to the previous generation introduced a Plimsoll brand to avoid insurance fraud associated with unworthy ships. Where has the crisis awareness of previous generations? In my opinion, we have to introduce the certification mentioned by the Parliament Roth-Behrendt, that is, a tank vessel marking on green brands, which some of the ports of Europe have been presented. Besides, we need to critically look at classification institutions. I think we cannot accept their procedure. We need independent and controlled procedures. Finally, I would like to say that some Commission units consider as a prohibited dock support that my country grants environmental support to shipowners who want to improve the level of the environment. The Commission does not know what's going on inside.	fi
This is, Mr President, dear colleagues, in my opinion an approach that corresponds to what we voted for two years ago. He certainly contradicts the joint position of the Council, but I think that the role of parliament is to actively participate in the process of co -fascination and not to submit to the decisions of the Council, even though they were the result of a very long -term pregnancy, which lasted two years. Mr President, chocolate was the subject of intense discussions at first reading. It was right, and it even produced results. Right, because the original proposal was only intended for the internal market. The quality of the product seems to be a secondary care and moral and legislative obligations to the developing countries are not taken into account by the Commission. The discussion has produced results. Anyone who seriously analyzes the common position can accept that democracy is working. We did not stay aside protesting and observing a passive attitude, but we reacted strongly and submitted amendments. Should we allow other vegetable fats? Yes, if this has to be done, but under our terms. We only wanted tropical vegetable fats, and the common position is restrictive in this case. We wanted a double marking, and the common position imposes it, only the additional marking should be on the main side of the package. We demanded a study to evaluate the impact, which will be prepared 2.5 years after the initiation of the Directive. We asked the Commission to possibly submit a proposal for amendment. Of course, she has to do so and we can possibly modify it again. We did not wish for commissionology for substantial modifications. We have succeeded in co -opinion. We were asking for more precise measuring methods I think the ISPRA Research Foundation did well. Many in this parliament were not satisfied with the committee's proposal. Other vegetable fats other than cocoa could not be avoided, but we used all means to put conditions in their use so that developing countries would argue that the text, as it is currently formed, is truly acceptable and that quality chocolates containing only cocoa can be distinguished by the rest. Mr President, as a shadow rapporteur for the European People's Party team, I am proud of the fact that almost all amendments at first reading, which have greatly influenced the common position, are the product of our work. On behalf of the European People's Party team we will not propose other amendments, but some colleagues are going to support others' amendments, much more because our amendments were accepted at first reading. Even though no amendment is accepted anymore, it is possible to make the outcome. I would like to complete with the following observation. The chocolate discussion has repeatedly referred to ethics. For me, moral behavior involves the fact that if this parliament achieves something, it can declare it and boast it. If one achieves a victory, one should enjoy it, and this may be, colleagues, to find out.	el
In any case, as with the banking guarantees, the Commission does not consider it appropriate to address such issues through specific provisions in specific regulations, but prefers the horizontal approach. We are opposed to amendment no.15 concerning the creation of an Environmental Monitoring Unit, as this is, in our opinion, the issue of internal organization of the Commission, which should not be addressed through a regulation. Such a unit actually works already, although we intend to further strengthen it. Finally, we do not support amendment no.17, as it does not comply with the usual rules or the usual formulation of regulations and is considered unnecessary. Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00. Please the main rapporteur, if he wishes to postpone, to ask for it at the time of the vote. Our services tell us that this application can be made then. Conservation and Sustainable Forest Management The Daily provision provides for the establishment for Mr. Bouwman's second reading (A5-0043/2000) on behalf of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee; (Mr. Bouwman interrupts the President.) Bouman.(De) Mr President, I think there was a mistake. There is a report before mine. I would gladly take the floor now, but there is a preceding report. Chairman. Thank you very much, sir, I knew certainly from the very beginning of the discussion because it made me so happy that I was seeing you here in the body. I apologize, but my papers have been mixed a bit. This sometimes happens in the rush of the evening meeting. Forget what I said so far. We start again from the beginning. The Daily provision provides for the establishment for the second reading (A5-0048/2000) of the Council of Development and Cooperation Committee on the Council of Common Location [12487/1/1999 - C5-0014/2000 - 1999/0015 (COD)] in view of the approvalManagement of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries (rapporteur: Mr Fernandez Martnn). Mr President, we are inaugurating with this debate - as Commissioner Nielson said - the new responsibilities exercised by the Committee for Development and Cooperation on Components. The regulation we are discussing today is to establish measures with the aim of promoting the maintenance and subordinate management of tropical forests in developing countries, so that the necessary funding can be ensured to maintain and promote the actions and plans that, for this purpose, have been in the process of being implemented by the implementation phase of 1999. The financial instrument by which the Union can fulfill the obligations arising from the biodiversity contract, the framework contract for climatic changes and the contract for the fight against degradation. All of these contracts note that it is necessary to support developing countries to find solutions to the problems of their forest resources. Between 1990 and 1995, more than 56 million hectares of forests were lost in an uneven -mannered way, but of course with implications specifically for developing countries, as a result of the increase in arable agricultural land, infrastructure manufacturing or natural disasters or due to fires.	el
"So the ""Grappa War"" is over.There is peace and we are looking forward to cooperation with South Africa according to the common dreams and values ​​that should have determined our relationship for a long time.I think this is a nice conclusion of the debate, which was quite positive overall, and I would like to thank me again with the rapporteur and the parliament for the cooperation, which in this context in relation to the countries of the Third World.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Stabilization and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia According to the agenda, the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr. Swoboda follows on behalf of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Joint Security and Defense Policy on the recommendation of the Commission for a decision to authorize the Commission, a stabilization and association agreement with the formerto negotiate Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC (1999) 1279 -C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121 (COS)).President, dear Commissioner Patten, dear colleagues!Today it is about a country that has truly difficult times, a country that has taken a very good development with its own will and certainly also with the support of the international community.Therefore, if the European Union, Council and Commission suggest - and Parliament is going to make this proposal, tomorrow, a stabilization and association agreement first in Southeast Europe, in the Balkan area - I dare to use this term - then this is primarily a thank you or the recognition that Fyrom/Macedonia has developed a good position, but of course economically, but of courseEspecially politically, in view of the war in the neighborhood and also in relation to your own minority.Because having a minority of 33 or 35 % in your own country is not a little thing in view of the surrounding area in which this country is located.The country and its politicians - certainly different here and there - have always done a very good job, and that should be recognized.The Commission suggests that we with the Council to conclude an agreement.I would like to make a few comments, namely regarding those areas in which there may be a little more differentiated views, although in this context I would also like to cut out the work and interest of the Commissioner Patten for Fyrom/Macedonia and for the entire region to a special extent and also mention it appreciatively.First, the regional approach.I think the regional approach is important and necessary if it is understood correctly.There must be the willingness to cooperate.If he is not understood as a compulsion, but as a willingness, as a possibility that should be used by every country, then this approach is correct.Only when we look at Fyrom/Macedonia, then we see that in the neighborhood there are some countries with which this cooperation z.B. is very difficult from an economic point of view, as is difficult with Kosovo and Albania, or politically difficult, such as Yugoslavia.On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, especially those with Greece, has developed positively, which should also be recognized."	de
These NGOs will face the most urgent needs, namely the movement of people at risk in safer areas, as well as the provision of health, water and hygiene services. ECHO is currently preparing a second decision to further grant 2m euros. This decision will be implemented through UNICEF, Action Contre La Faim, COSV, Nuova Frontera and Vireaid, of course, is of course assigned to take and examine their final proposals. These NGOs will focus on the fields of waters and hygiene, shelter, plastic scenes, buns, blankets and other species. They will focus on reinstalling people who have left their homes, further prevention of malaria, cholera and other contagious diseases, the provision of supplementary foods to those who do not feed well and in the children at risk, in the provision of seeds and tools, to the safety of theThe flocks are promoted to the villages. In the light of the Nielson Commissioner's mission, a third decision may be made. The Commission is also preparing a medium -term response from the Community, which will combine NGO co -financing with European Development Fund businesses, so that Mozambique can react to the crisis situation, re -establishing the rapid growth rates for which it has worked hard to achieve. This response may link the current phase of the emergency situation to the reconstruction within three to four years. At such times, we all realize how much we need to do to prevent disasters and to quickly deal with the disasters that we cannot prevent. I'm not sure if I can add more to this stage in terms of analyzing the mistakes that happened and what we can do better. Obviously, we have to learn from any lessons from this tragic disaster. I repeat that Commissioner Nielson will be happy to reference to parliament when he returns from Mozambique and the scene of the disaster. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, dear colleagues, Mozambique is a new African country that has made superhuman efforts to regain the lost time of the two decades of civil war and adapt to the Republic. Mozambique's success is the result of an effort that belongs to the government, the opposition, but especially to its people. But all the efforts made in recent years, after all the difficulties of the peace agreements that we all know are at risk of being lost with the thing that nature has fired against Mozambique in recent weeks. The latest figures arriving about the dimensions of the disaster are scary. As the Commissioner already said, we are talking about about a million people who have left their homes, more than a hundred people on the roofs of their homes, or on trees and waiting for a helicopter to come to save them. And there are also some hundreds of dead. The European Union and the various Member States, including my country, have already provided financial support for emergency, perhaps a bit late, but they did so, as well as the United States, as well as various countries in the region, and in particular South Africa.	el
"Nowadays, no one can disregard the fact that new digital techniques and systems with tops of the Internet, mobile phones and digital television, are radically changing the entire tourism and its structures and business models. The introduction of new techniques is not a threat to tourism, but an opportunity because it provides the opportunity to provide new innovations in tourism products and services that tourism needs during the prolonged tourist season to attract new customers and offer new alternative forms of tourism. In addition, new techniques allow new markets to be opened in areas that have traditionally been in poor position and have not attracted tourism and can now develop into tourist centers and significant investments. Tourism training programs and business training programs and training and rehabilitation programs for the unemployed must respond to these new labor markets. The Committee on Women's Rights and Equality has focused on the issue of education in particular because 53 % of the tourism service workers are women -these are official numbers -and at the same time forming the majority of employees who are susceptible to social and economic changes. It should not be forgotten that tourism workers, and especially women, have special problems, such as seasonal work, need to re -enter into contracts year after year, lack of social protection, lack of interest in education and poor development. So we ask the Commission to take special action and to connect the principle of equal opportunities to all tourism programs and corporate development programs. Mr President, Mr Members of the Commission, I would like to initially make an optimistic note that a high -level group stated in a report by October 1998, which on the first page read: ""By the end of the next decade, the Union offers the opportunity to create 2,200,000 - 3,300,000 new jobs in the fields of travel.""In my opinion, the task of the Commission and Parliament is to answer two questions: what are the right circumstances and what can be the role of the European Union in this matter? The Commission and Parliament can help us understand what we are first and foremost, for even the concept of ""tourism"", as stated in the Viceconte report, still has a diversified concept, a kind of variable whose interpretation depends on the latitude, the climate, many opportunities and interpretive things, it may be a sinful of the holiday.the possibility of employment. We lack information: we have no information on the financial impact, it is still a full mystery. We have completely contradictory methods of collecting and interpreting statistics, despite the 1995 Directive, the Commission and Parliament. In order to develop a strategy, I think it would be of paramount importance to develop a consistent and most accurate reading method for this information, including that tourism could really create employment. In this respect, there is no automation: often in the past, the growth of tourism has led to significant accrual of wealth without having to grow in employment. There is no legal basis, and we think this is a significant restriction, at the moment, for any tourism industry. The legal basis means the ability to coordinate and develop programs and strategies that are invaluable to the fact that the European Union's tourism sector can compete with other markets. The legal basis would allow for the possibility of avoiding compulsion, as before, to the Structural Funds, which are a kind of pocket money, and besides, there are very few these funds available: we remember that the Commission's announcement mentioned the amount of EUR 4,700,000,000 in the last five years. We do not have the opportunity to convey a strong message to the Member State: recognizing the legal legal basis would give the states the opportunity to give the European Union a jurisdiction that is currently completely random."	fi
How should one call the rapes, looting, fire trucks and the deportations declared as cleansing that are reminiscent of the darkest Middle Ages in Europe?How should one denote the isolation of the Russian and international journalists and the exile of humanitarian organizations and every international investigation commission from the places of the massacre?If this is real policy, if we really have no means in our hands, then I ask you, Mr. Hoher representative, Mr. Commissioner, we should at least use the means we have, the aid programs for Russia.The Chechen War proves - if that was still necessary - that the obligation to interference or the right to interference ends at the limit of the large powers.So we ensure that in the future every euro issued in the Russian Federation will be used for nothing other than solving the sufferings of the population affected by the war.Mr. Hoher representative, you have spoken of the previous progress in the implementation of Helsinki's decisions.Some of us are very decided to create a purely European security organization to protect peace in the world.Of course, we recognize the importance of the Security Council for the preservation of peace and international security, which is also anchored in the decisions of Helsinki.However, you have noted that this should also have been questioned in Helsinki, which was also considered in Helsinki, in the recent past.The jumping point is: does the political will exist that this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg resolutions, receives really independent skills?What about the infrastructures?Is it planned in any form to ensure this independent skills of the entire system?Second, what should become of the European Defense Industry, which is ultimately integrated into all activities related to the system?Are the current programs continued?If finally, a change in the contract is necessary, how should it be implemented in your opinion, which is presented in Feira, implemented and included in the general process of reforming the institutional framework of the contract?In what context is this in your opinion on the possible introduction of the qualified majority?Are there such considerations?Is this question discussed?To what extent did the cooperation between you and the responsible commissioner have concrete results and a framework strategy how this system can be really efficiently designed in your opinion?Mr President, from my studies in European history, I believe that the Sintra agreement was a controversial peace agreement in 1809, which resulted in an extension than a shortening of the Napoleonic wars and almost cost the Duke of Wellington.I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra agreement.Now I would like to congratulate the high representative for the advances achieved so far.However, it should be noted that in the most part of his explanations about progress in institutional matters, and the true examination for European defense identity will be their ability to produce competence and performance instead of founding facilities with nicely formulated designations.And as far as this is concerned, I am not aware of how far our heavy -duty transport capacities have been developed to bring these 60,000 men to their locations, or what progress we can show in view of an autonomous information service, in particular in view of the announcements of the Americans not to provide the Europeans with no clarification data unless they dominate security.	de
However, I believe that the reference to the actual convergence of the average regional levels of growth in Europe offers a somewhat incomplete picture of the situation, and unfortunately, this message is often repeated in the press and in some speeches. The Commission's report greatly mitigates this finding, especially when it comes to the social and economic situation of certain Union regions, for which I have particular interest: I am referring to overseas French apartments and more generally to the excessive districts. In this respect, I am glad that the Regional Policy Committee has adopted one of my amendments, which calls on the Commission to devote a special chapter to its next report on cohesion, regarding the particular case of the out -of -the -art regions, and more specifically, to analyze the impact of its impacts,Amsterdam. Finally, it seems to me that the sixth periodic exhibition offers interesting arguments for the prospect of a real sustainable and balanced development plan of European territory, especially when it is confronted with the importance of the relationship between the center of Europe and its region. Although the Commission is still hesitant to declare it unequivocally, its periodic report demonstrates the urgent need to encourage a multicenter development of the Community space, through the structural policies of the Union and in the context of the actions introduced by the European system of integrated financial accounts. Mr President, the party of the European Socialist Party of Parliament agrees with the report just presented by Mr Berend and congratulates its author, both on the quality of his conclusions and his flexibility, which allowed the amendment to the Committee of Amendments. It should be reminded that today the total competitiveness of the European Union amounts to 81% of the competitiveness of the United States of America and that this number will only improve if the number of our competitive units, which are regions, is improved; this is also the case at a time when technological evolution and globalization,For regions, but also for businesses and for individuals, a greater competitive effort. The sixth exposure of the European Commission offers valuable conclusions. I summarize two of them, which the rapporteur has already reminded us of, a positive and one negative. The first is that significant progress in territorial and social cohesion have been made throughout the territory of the Union and that Community Funds were an important, though not decisive, factor in alleviating regional inequalities. The downside is that this important effort made was more effective in approaching the GDP and the productivity of Europe's regions than to approach their employment levels. Therefore, it is important to link more structural funding to job creation. It is, Mr. Commissioner, the first mandate for the next period. Therefore, Mr President, I ask my dear colleagues to approve this report and ask the Commission, as other colleagues did, to maintain the conclusions of its sixth periodic report, in view of the planning for the period 2000-2006.	el
In particular, I would emphasize the energy review, which I consider very important as a presenter. Mr. Member of the Commission, I would like to decide on this presentation by emphasizing a worrying issue of one of the members of our committee on the one hand and on one of the requirements of our committee. The concern is to develop pre-development of Central and Eastern European countries from the perspective of competition policy and state aid. This is, of course, a multidimensional issue that we would like a report from the Commission to look at the ability of economies preparing for membership in particular to comply with competition rules and the obvious need to create special rules on state subsidies to facilitate structural reform in these countries. And finally, I decide to do so, the requirement applies to the future competence of the European Parliament in the fields we have to deal with, in the competition policy and in the field of government aid, for the inter -governmental conference. As you know, a consignment member of the Commission, our report is of the opinion that the joint decision procedure must apply when deciding on the basic legislation of state aid. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, Mr Magnian Women and Lords, my share in today's debate applies to the rules of steel support. These are European public subsidies granted on the basis of these rules and revised by the Commission. In 1998 there were a total of 27 such cases. Of these cases, the Commission has given its own report. The time of the establishment of the European Coal and Steel Community (EHTD) will soon expire. Therefore, today we need to deal with how steel support will be processed in the future. The European Parliament considers the decisions set out in the Commission's report, including the decision to claim the funds granted in one concrete case and thus apply Article 88 of the Treaty of EHY. The competitiveness of the European steel industry is also content in the latest Commission, which we have not yet dealt with in Parliament. Like other sectors, the iron and steel industries are subject to a general support ban in Article 87 (1) of the EC establishment agreement. According to this article, state aid is in principle inconsistent with joint markets. Exceptions are only allowed in precisely defined cases. According to Article 88, the Commission is obliged to supervise state subsidies. In 1998, the largest case was the directing of EUR 540 million to the German PruSAG Stahl. In addition, Member States shall notify the Commission in advance of their aid. The valid rules for the steel industry were drawn up on 18 December 1996. According to them, support for the steel industry can only be granted for certain carefully defined cases. These include research and development, environmental protection, social security to promote the closure of steel factories, and to completely close the least competitive companies. In addition, there is an exception arrangement for Greece, which allows for a maximum of EUR 50 million. However, in recent years, there were obvious problems in implementing steel support rules that are not fully covered in the report. From the Parliament's point of view, it is important that we are already talking about the regulation following the expiration of these steel rules. There is no decision to reinforce the current basic lines of steel support rules. Nobody wants a unbridled support racing in Europe. It would also significantly damage the internal market after the stability of the steel industry in recent years. Therefore, the Parliament considers it necessary to change the rules of steel support by taking into account industry allegations of unequal treatment, and the Commission is preparing the next proposal for the Council. It is known that the Council has so far refused to decide that regulation. It is also due to the belief that when the validity of the steel support rules ends, it can be done again without the annoying control of the European Commission. We demand that the rules of steel support must be regulated by a Council decree in accordance with Article 94 after the termination of the agreement, since it is only the necessary legal binding and clarity. Only in this way can the strict prohibition of all the aid outside the rules of steel support. Regional governments must also comply with the Council Regulation, which is immediately valid. Damage to the competitive conditions and serious disturbances in market balance should also be avoided in the future. In addition, it is necessary to criticize the Commission's practice of adopting several subsidies to steel companies who, in its view, are not covered by the aid rules, even though the Court of Justice of the European Communities has accepted this unequal treatment in individual decisions.	fi
On the other hand, how do we find that these principles have been realized? At the World Trade Organization level, this regulation and these standards have led to an increase in the amount of trade in merchandise, in other words, the growth of wealth, but unfortunately, we must say that we have to deepen the shafts between trade groups and the richest countries and the world's richest countries and the most underdeveloped countries in the world. Therefore, it is justified and necessary to ask yourself: for what purpose the current common standards and rules are needed? What is the need for current negotiation activities and current activities of the World Trade Organization, if it increases the exchange of merchants, but at the same time causes dysfunction and, above all, expands this gap between rich and poor countries? For this reason, we have said that our strategy for the Commission, which it has announced here that it will follow in Seattle's negotiations and onwards. Above all, this strategic view is made, but now we need courage and courage. On the one hand, because of a strong demand for the link between social rights, environmental rights and consumer protection in these immediate negotiations. But most of all, because we have an ambitious and bold long -term view of renewal, not only the WTO but also joy, the united nations, and, above all, financial institutions, more precisely the IMF and the World Bank. We should not look at globalization as a partial phenomenon, but we must have the courage to see a more universal point of view so that wealth would not actually benefit more advanced countries and trade groups, but progress and harmonious development would take place in every region of the world. Mr President, I also thank the Commission for taking the initiative and presented us with a report of his strategic goals for the next five -year term, even though I hope that in later documents, it would try to avoid over -the -notch and vague expressions in the text we discuss today. Mr President, however, I'm once again a screaming voice in the wilderness because the document does not mention fishing policy. It is indeed amazing that the Commission does not consider one of the strategic aims of the following years, with the aim of the process of reforming its common policy in 2002. This re -review process is undoubtedly the most important of events that affect the fishing industry in many years. However, it seems that it is not important for the Commission, whose task is to give the Council and Parliament before the end of 2001 a report on the activities of a common fishing policy over the last decade. Based on this report, the Council must decide on the amendment of a common fishing policy. In fact, the re -review process has already begun in many organs and institutions, such as the European Parliament, which already prepared and approved a report that identified all the current problems and shortcomings of the common fishing policy. We have been asking for a minimum schedule for this re -review many times and we have not received an answer. And less than two years is not a long time to remember that fishing policy is in an exceptional situation for internal market rules and that these exceptions should be resolved in the context of the reform process. The Mr President, the Mr President of the Commission, therefore ask that this vital topic in this very important field of the European Union should be taken into account in this strategy and in the strategic objectives of the next five years. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the chairman prod for his program. I am particularly positive about recognizing sustainable growth in self -feeding development: in the expanding European market of the information society, as well as a fully functional cohesive currency that gives us the opportunity to really promote well -being, innovation, entrepreneurship and - the most important thing - very high quality and sustainable jobs for European citizens. I would express one attention, not to reproach, President Prod of this morning's statement, namely that it was a bit weak in terms of the actual content of economic policy. We must not take anything for granted in the restructuring of the European economy.	fi
"There have been several examples in Spain: Michelin, Abb-Alstom, and there are examples in Italy that my colleagues will give you.There is also another disguised method of dismissal, which, for example, uses, in Spain the company Ericsson under the name ""outsourcing"" (behind this beautiful word hides that of ""dismissal"").The outsourcing of services, that is to say the subcontracting of services, amounts to transforming a stable and fixed employment in precarious employment, without union rights or social rights.It is indeed a disguised method of dismissal.Mr. Commissioner, the European institutions, if they believe in that they claim and they speak of full employment, will have to take clear measures: review the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations, review the directive relating to collective layoffs, reduce working time, condition European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social clauses and work in international agreementsthe European Union.Mr. President, this Parliament again discusses business restructuring in Europe and I deplore it.Once again, workers may lose their jobs.Today, we are alluding to the workers of Goodyear from Cisterna Di Latina.As we have already recalled, these are some 600 people and as many families who could, within a month, be deprived of their only source of income.These workers - despite the availability they have shown towards the company and despite their great professionalism thanks to which the Cisterna factory is one of the most productive in Europe - may be excluded from the production circuit.On the other hand, Goodyear, who has benefited, for years, from national and European subsidies, can, quietly and freely, close its doors.I believe that this attitude is not correct: it is not correct with regard to the workers of the Cisterna factory, it is not correct with regard to all Italian and European citizens who allowed Goodyear, even indirectly by the taxes they pay, to benefit from the state aid which I have spoken previously.The European Commission and the Council must assume all the responsibilities linked to this case, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on information and the consultation of workers as well as community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies which undertake to sign long -term agreements in order to protect employment.Today, we ask the Commission to defend, above all, the workers of Goodyear de Cisterna and to exercise all possible pressures on the company in order to reach an agreement, as soon as possible, aimed at ensuring that the Cisterna factory continues to exist and turn.Finally, I would like to remind you, Mr. President and the Commissioner, that the time we have is really limited.Consequently, all the measures - including those already cited by the Commissioner in his introductory report - that we would like to adopt, must be immediately and fall into the subject.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, in terms of restructuring, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt to better face the new challenges, under penalty of having to disappear."	fr
"It is therefore time to flatten all the elements of the chain that participate in the manufacture of yield animal food.Note in passing, and it is a shame, that the problem is much less serious for the food of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.Is it because of the wild and globalized competition that manufacturers of this sector are engaged in the industry that it has transformed into a recycling sector of all waste in the food industry?Such a serious subject cannot be limited to a technical debate, even if it is already the directive which limits the authorization of antibiotics and other growth factors.The precautions that we are preparing to take for animal feed must also be applied for the food of farm animals, the very ones that we will find on our plate.As this relationship with force points out, labeling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer, in his exploitation, know all the ingredients that enter into the composition of the food he intends to his cattle.He must know, moreover, if GMOs have made their intrusion into his bag of protein pellets.These components can potentially represent a risk to public health.In any case, the precautionary principle imposes the requirement of a traceability clearly displayed at all levels of the marketing of these products.But before labeling, it is necessary to set up clear rules.You have to ask yourself simple questions, such as that of the real purpose of using animal flours.If we look at all the problems they have posed to us, from an ethical point of view and from a health point of view, it is on their very use that we must question themselves today.To do this, the chapter of the White Paper on Food Safety which deals with animal feed must serve us as a workplace to go far beyond the simple commercial questions.The commission has taken this example several times: ""from the fork to the fork"".Our colleague from the PPE highlighted this earlier.It is a good formula, it is still necessary to give it meaning.And to give it meaning, we have to deal with both animal problems and those related to consumer's health.This is why it is important to accept amendment 2 to considering 4, which avoids the risk of monopoly if companies which have already been the first authorized to put an additive on the market remained the only ones who could exploit it during the re -evaluation period.But above all, we must accept amendments 4 and 5 to the new article 2bis, which will clearly designate the genetically modified additives in order to allow users to make a decision with full knowledge of the facts.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the presence of high -tech additives in the animal feeding sector requires actors - and everyone knows that they are very numerous - the provision of detailed information on their use, to put an end to practices contrary to Community law.The directive in question, on the additives in animal feeding, cannot be enough.Other directives will follow and I think they are in good hands at the Agriculture Commission.The food and the additives are structured, mixed, cut, cut and transported several times until the sale of meat, milk, bread and other products in stores."	fr
"As far as the former is concerned, the Commission gave us a number of proposals that are contained in two guidelines and an action plan, with which the following decision, which the heads of government put into tampers in tampers, is to be implemented: ""A fair treatment of third -country nationals, which are legitimate in the territory of its Member States.To recognize obligations such as EU citizens "".Exactly the opposite of what we have seen and found in El Ejido these days: a world of violations, work exploitation and miserable living conditions that have already been charged.I hope for an early implementation of the measures to integrate, and I also hope that the governments that found such beautiful words in Tampere - among them the government of Spain - are also comprehensive for their implementation.I have less hope in developing an effective and just European politics, which is coherent with the explanations of the Council in the field of immigration.The only proposal received is the guideline for family reunification, a key topic - we saw many single men in El Ejido these days in the media - but we do not know whether it has already been accepted by the governments.Outside the common area, some governments make efforts to redesign their immigration policy.This is done in my country, regardless of the government;The ruling party is the only one who fails the new foreigners law.The goal of combating racism and xenophobia mentioned in the contracts should adopt all institutions and all the politically responsible for the Union.On February 28, 1998, the European political parties signed the Charter of Political Parties for Europe for a society without racism.The People's Party also did it.This commits you to a coherent behavior, but local leaders of this party still pour oil into the sparked fire by boycotting the extinguishing tests of other institutions.The party, which the mayor of El Ejido belongs, should act consistently.Only in great unity, as Mr. Hernández said Mollar, El Ejido, and with him all of Spain and Europe, can manage facts that are deeply shaped by us today.President!In view of the scenes of a real lynch justice against Moroccan workers, as they have played in El Ejido, one can only feel disgust and outrage.To what extent the racist right -wing extremist commands are responsible or the simple people who are careless and thoughtlessly the same as these commands.We would like to express our unrestricted solidarity with these Moroccan employees, who are not only exploited by unscrupulous employers, but are also victims of such attacks.If there are members of the simple referendum among the aggressors, we can only tell you that you shovel your own grave with your actions.When they wage war against people who are as poor as they are, they only do a service to their own exploiters and prepare a future of oppression for themselves.An even greater responsibility than the rackets armed with knives and iron rods bear those who operate racist, xenophobic agitation, those who keep in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, and even here in this meeting room, demagogical xenophobic speeches.They are no better than those who take this reactionary absurd demagogy for bare coin."	de
"We have all instruments, all instruments we need, but we have to bundle them much more effectively than before, and that is the challenge that the high representative and I will face in the next four to five years.Now I hope that when we master these challenges, we will receive support in the form of adequate middle equipment as well as brilliant rhetoric.We all know that there are a number of reasons to build a common foreign and security policy.I would like to give you three of them: Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.These are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy, and we will be measured by how successfully the common foreign and security policy we developed will be, especially how we deal with the events in the Balkans.We must not lose sight of the fact that quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians and quite a few senators and congress members ask: ""How should we take them seriously when developing a common foreign and security policy if they don't even get the problems at your own doorstep?"" So the big test for us will be the Balkans.I hope that all those heads of government, all the prominent politicians in our Member States, who promised the blue from heaven for the Balkans, have promised the Marshall plans and gave the Balkans all the other promises that they are there if the household authority makes their decision, how much we have to spend on the Balkans.My great hope would be that we all live on a planet, whose inhabitants also include the European Council, the Council General Affairs and the Council of Economic and Financial Questions.Everyone lives together on the same political planet and ensure that there is a certain agreement between what we have promised to the world and what we can indeed realize.In the past few months of my activity, I have heard assurance that we will be more involved in Latin America, I have heard promise that we will pay for it in the event of an agreement in the Frieden process in the Middle East.I also heard of our project to build a stability pact in the South Caucasus.And I heard the promise that we want to ensure democracy in Indonesia by supporting this country more.How do we get the cow off the ice?And this should not be alluded to one of the political disputes of the recent past.In my opinion, we should always turn to this question in the coming weeks and months.One of the reasons, which is why I am so passionate about the implementation of an effective reform of our foreign assistance programs, is that I do not want to get into a situation again where someone is asking a question of how those to deep gap between rhetoric and reality, and the answer is: ""Oh, we know that they do not work very effectively, we know that they have not kept all their obligations, we know that there is still some money in theirPantry "".I want us to be able to say: ""It is no longer."	de
Preparation of the Lisbon Summit will show that in Europe we are not working enough, and that if we are to become the most dynamic in the world, then not only should we work more but we should have more information and more ability to use it. In order to increase the rate of employment and finance social security systems, we must work for a longer time, throughout our lives, and in particular there should be more working women with a higher level of knowledge. We hope, therefore, that this Lisbon Summit will help to change the current women's work model. Mr President, I would like to ask you if you are predicting that there will be conclusions from this summit that will allow specific measures to be taken with a specific timetable so that there are more women not only in the workplace, but mainly in the new knowledge economy. Thank you very much, Mr. President of the Commission, thank you very much, Mr. President of the Council, for your important contribution to the very interesting and important discussion. I announce to you that I have received six proposals for resolution, in accordance with Article 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure. The vote will take place on Wednesday, at 12.00 the discussion ended.(The meeting is interrupted at 20:15 and continues at 9pm) Before we continue the meeting, I would like to make an observation, which I always do during the evening meetings, but since the faces are changing in the room, there will be many here who do not know it yet. I would like to ask you to contribute to the seamless conduct of the meetings by observing the speech time that is attributable to each of you. And this for three reasons. The former has to do with the well -known rule in the parties: The more time goes by, the more cheerful the guests are - this is not the case for the plenary. The second reason is: The people who sit behind the glass partitions - the interpreters - want to return to their homes for a while. The third reason is that in addition to interpreters there are many other people in the backstage, who must work each time until the end of the session, so that, for example, summary minutes will be ready tomorrow. For these reasons, keep, please, the talk times and then the meeting will proceed without delay! Environmental Dimension in Development Process The Daily provision provides for the establishment for the second reading (A5-0051/2000) of the Development and Cooperation Committee on the Common Location of the Council [12485/1/1999 - C50013/2000 - 1999/0020 (COD) for the approvalIntegration of the environmental dimension into the process of developing developing countries (rapporteur: Mr. Wijkman). Mr President, since 1987 when the Brundtland exhibition was presented, it has been clear that that policy that is unilaterally emphasized economic growth cannot be sustainable in the long run. The challenge for all of us consists of integrating social and environmental concern. Among other things, this implies that environmental care cannot be treated as a subject of a sector, but, in the planning phase, clarified and minimized by various measures possible negative effects on the environment in relation to production, transport, building activity, etc.	el
In view of the attitude that we took in Seattle, I am surprised to implement the silence of the failure of the EU to implement the calibration of trade, which had already been decided for developing countries in the GATT negotiations, including the extremely important textile sector.With regard to the common agricultural policy, the greatest culprit, the developmental effects of the GAP reforms were not assessed as part of the Agenda 2000.The scandal about the system of export refunds is generally known: 54,000 tons of excess, subsidized beef were exported to the West African markets at dumping prices, and this resulted in a burglary of the producer prices for the local cattle breeders by 50 %.300,000 tons of beef are currently stored.Who will be the next victim?I welcome the explanation of Mr. Amado, in which he pointed out the problems in connection with the lack of inclusion of the EEF in the budget this morning, and in which a more active role in the development council and the consideration of development priorities as a central element of the new common foreign and security policy are required.I also welcome the explanation of the 1992 Council, its resolution of 1997 and the subsequent changes in the contract of the European Union.So far, the necessary measures have not been initiated.For this reason, we demand annual reports that we are calling for a cross -departmental working group that meets once a year, and we call for a lawsuit to ensure that the corresponding measures really take place.I ask Mr. Nielson to comment directly on these points of the resolution.President!I just want to say something about the connection between development cooperation and agriculture.In recent years, a significant part of the funds has flowed into the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in developing countries, especially in the Lomé countries.The results certainly do not meet our expectations.What could that be due to?I think the cause is mainly in the lack of consistent agricultural policy in certain developing countries, even if this certainly does not apply to everyone.The Commission has an important role in developing such a policy.No farmer, wherever in the world, will create something if the prices are too low.Governments in developing countries always face a difficult decision: Who should they support, the farmers or the people in the big cities who want to buy inexpensive food?This sensitive balance must be found together with the Commission and not by it: in most countries in which the Commission is active, development aid is also provided by the Member States.Member States' policy must not contradict the Commission's Politics.The commission delegations in developing countries are responsible for playing a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and ensuring that all countries control the same course.Particular attention must also be paid to the means of production.Far too often, artificial fertilizers, animal medication and many other things are made available free of charge.If the project has expired after five years, this policy of gifts also ends.In this respect, the cost element should be developed from the start in the politics of all projects.As far as I know, this is far from the case.	de
"My second question refers to Africa, which, in contrast to all other continents, is also not mentioned in Shaping the New Europe.In Africa we have most refugees in the world, the greatest poverty and a devastating AIDSepidemia.I know that Commissioner Nielson and others do a good job in this area, but the entire commission must, even in its strategic goals, focus more on this continent.Finally, I can be underlined that I welcome the commission to explain the first time that the EU is ready to take one -sided measures in order to grant developing countries more access to our markets.My question is: When will this be done?President, Mr President of the Commission, venerated colleagues, lies a document in front of us that is of crucial importance for the future and fate of Europe.For us, however, an immediate challenge mean two aspects under all the points mentioned that are closely interwoven: peace and stability in Europe and outside of Europe.These goals must primarily be pursued, which has long been our common endeavor, but we also have to make it clear that they cannot be achieved without the expansion - may they also cause costs.We are called today to choose between one less enough for the coming decades, but for the entire planet a lamp of peace and civilization Europe and a perhaps richer Europe without future visions.However, these goals can only be realized if, in the end of the government conference that ended in one year, a constitutional reform takes shape in the context of which the commission, which may not be an executor of the decisions of the council or the co -decisions of the parliament, but must also take on the role of a real government of Europe, adequate and real powers are transferred.Parliament would have to be the first proponent of this reform if it really wants to expand its role as the mouthpiece of the Union citizens' will and take over the central function of how it stands for a really democratic and strongly integrated Union.In addition, the Commission can only stand within the framework of the powers actually transferred to it for the obligations taken over.Without these perspectives, Europe would look forward to a hopeless future.President, Mr, Mr President, we can only welcome the announced ambitious goals that are in line with the challenges before Europe.As I state, the fall of the Berlin Wall is the most important event for you at the end of this century.This event forms the basis for the expansion.However, I would prefer this word ""extension"" and rather speak of reunification, because this seems to me to have much stronger political importance.They take up the idea of ​​concentrating their work more on the core tasks, and make this a goal of their reforms.Basically, it is about the use of the principle of subsidiarity.The clear application of this principle can only increase the measures carried out and convey a clear idea of ​​any level of responsibility to the citizens.Yes, Mr. Prodi, to announce this is one thing to carry out it completely different!"	de
More and more wars are taking place under conditions of anarchy without the existence of stable structures, without any government that controls the areas affected by conflicts. The world was witnessed by a growing number of wars, where weapons were without a doubt against the citizens and where the aim of the war was to extinction of specific social groups. In such situations, humanitarian aid to victims, of course, is of course welcome, which leaves the rest of the world in a horrible dilemma. The problem is that Geneva's contracts do not adequately cover the activities of the humanitarian bodies. Although Geneva's contracts contain provisions on the right to provide humanitarian aid under crisis conditions, they also determine that this right presupposes the approval of its government's ratio. This is especially true when it comes to civil strife. The principle of humanitarian aid access or the right of the international community to support and protect the distressed, if a state is unable - or not willing - to do so alone, do not find ecumenical application. It is a serious violation of the humanitarian authority and, in some cases, is a fatal lack of responsibility for many victims of war. It was precisely the issue of the right to uninterrupted access to humanitarian organizations was the main point of my meeting in Chechnya at the beginning of February. In my opinion, it is a serious issue today to what extent the circumstances require a revision of Geneva contracts and how. I believe we have two options that are not interconnected. The first is to modify the contracts so that they can better deal with today's complex judgments, such as the establishment of the right to provide humanitarian aid to distressed. The other possibility is to ensure that the humanitarian authorities are actually implemented, as defined in Geneva Conventions, for example by improving their enforcement mechanisms. The first choice we have, the revision and reassessment of the content of the contracts, in order to fill in all gaps, is complex and risky. Complex because wars are continuing to change character and risky because it cannot be ruled out that the issue of revising contracts is not excluded that new negotiations may not lead to a new agreement. Let me, however, say, with all clarity, that, I have a whole, I support the establishment of the principle of humanitarian access to all circumstances and to strengthen the right of distressed to receive humanitarian aid. Regarding the second option, that is, ensuring the best implementation of existing authorities, I am of the view that the prosecution of criminal proceedings against the lawsuit of the law is one of the many promising opportunities to be implemented. The obligation of states to prosecute war criminals is determined in Geneva's conventions, but not with sufficient clarity. So I signify the requirement for a rapid ratification of the ICC statutes of the International Criminal Court. The issue was reported today during the discussion. On behalf of the Commission I will agree that we must work together in order to find a solution to this project, a solution that will also become a legal reality.	el
It should be remembered that during the Conference on Rural Development which was held in Cork from November 7 to 9, 1996, rural development was defined as one of the priorities of the European Union, insofar as it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole of the rural fabric (infrastructure, public and private services ....).In this context, we have deplored in commission of credits devoted to rural development and supported the amendments requesting an increase in the budget for this community initiative, so that it is in line with the previous leaders leader I and Leader II.Compared to this latest initiative which had a period limited to 6 years, the budget allocated to leader +, for a period of 7 years, is 50 %.This is not eligible with regard to the importance of rural development and the consequences, for farmers, the fall in prices and aids such as it is planned in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.Finally, among the priority parameters which will be introduced on the European scale to allow local inscriptions, special attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been carried out by GAL within the framework of Leader II initiative, but which could not succeed due to the calendar and the heaviness of the planned management devices.(The session, suspended at 1:40 p.m., is resumed at 3 p.m.) Additives in animal feed The agenda calls for the report (A5-0015/2000) of Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, in the name of the Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a directive of the Council modifying the 70/524/EEC directive in the additives in the food of animals (1999) 388 -388 -C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168 (CNS)).Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner byrne, Directive 70/524 currently provides for different treatments for high -tech additives in the replacement of existing authorizations.The Commission now proposes to harmonize the procedures of authorization, so that the substances which have been authorized before 1988 are set up with equality with that which is authorized now.In this regard, the Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development is in agreement.However, the directive also includes the authorization of antibiotics, other drug substances, growth factors and genetically modified organisms.It is about health here and not a simple harmonization of legislation.The Agriculture Commission is therefore of the opinion that the legal basis - Article 37 - is not eligible here and that the Commission must rather offer us a legal basis based on article 152, which provides for the codecision of Parliament.We asked for the advice of our legal committee, which indicated, concerning this harmonization of legislation, that article 37 would suffice in this case.We, the Commission for Agriculture,, however, were not limited to the treatment of this harmonization of legislation;We have filed another amendment, given the fact that this proposal also relates to genetically modified organizations, and this amendment addresses the question of content and also, therefore, the health of the population.We have negotiated two years with the Commission for the seed directive and we found a compromise that governs the dissemination of genetically modified organizations in this directive.To do this, we started from the basic text for this 70/524 directive.Mr. Byrne, we do not understand why the commission undertakes harmonizations and does not also provide for the harmonization of the text concerning genetically modified organisms.	fr
"Why shouldn't one put a kind of technological convergence criterion in Lisbon, according to which the Member States should increase their research and development effort to at least 2.5 % of their GDP within five years, which would still be below the current proportion of the United States?In this context, I would also like to welcome the initiative of Commission member Philippe Busquin to create a European research area.Better living conditions, employment and the quality of employment will continue to depend to a large extent on our ability to stimulate European research.This would also be a real European patent, the development of risk capital, the support of young companies of decisive importance.President Predi received my execution about the future deficit in Europe last night.However, I think he misunderstood me, because I did not charge the Portuguese chair or the Commission that they lack a long time, but spoke of the fear of the future that many of our fellow citizens grasped in a strongly changing world.We are all aware that the development of the information society means a paradigm shift.But in a world in which 1.5 billion people still live without electrical streams, the inclusion of all people in the world in the internet society cannot be realized in the immediate future.The biggest challenge for humanity is to avoid the division into ""info-rich"" and ""low-info"" countries, to prevent the origin of companies in which the digital breaks are the new social breaks after the apt expression of my friend Claude Desama.The annual legislative program is the most concrete expression of the constitutional and political key powers of the European Commission, thanks to which it has the sole right of initiative.Such powers must always be right and clearly justified.As in all previous years, this year's work program remains a detailed justification for each of the numerous newly proposed measures.The 15-page general summary of the 500 initiatives, which are listed in the appendix, really does not do justice.In future, the ELDR will therefore insist on a clear reason for all measures announced in the work program and a corresponding special parliamentary debate.Above all, we are concerned with evidence that every new proposal has been examined in detail whether it withstands the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.Furthermore, we will be concerned with sector -specific debates in the special committees of the European Parliament.In other words, it is high time that the somewhat antiquated procedure according to which this decisive program document is developed and discussed is subjected to general overhaul.Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for talking to us twice within 24 hours.Yesterday evening he clearly and clearly stated that the prospects for the European economy are very positive for the next two to three years and that the unexpectedly above -average growth rates will make it easier for us to achieve the goals of this annual legislative program.In his contribution from this morning, the Commission President appeals three problems that make me worry.The first concerns the subsidiarity, in which our faction exists very much, and the liberals have already referred to the fact that it must be demonstrated for each individual proposal that it is in the interests of Europe."	de
"I do not know whether this information is correct, but we as an EPP ED faction would be grateful if this point were discontinued because the parliament has already dealt with this question several times.There are also resolutions against such a tax.That is why my parliamentary group requests that this point be deducted from the agenda.Thank you very much, Mr. Poettering.We are now coming to Mr. Wurz, who speaks against the application.Ms. President, I would like to point out that what Mr. Poettering says is not quite logical.On the one hand, he teaches the social democratic faction because it questions a very clear and clear decision by the President's conference.And now it does exactly the same.We discussed, we agreed, only the EPP faction and the liberals.And I had also pointed out that the other presidential colleagues will remember that it is not about whether one is for or against Tobin tax, but whether we are willing to listen to what the Commission and the Council think of it.That is not too much required.So I repeat the proposal to maintain this oral request to the Commission and the Council in order to experience the opinion of these two institutions for this relatively modest proposal, which would be an important signal for the public, especially after the excitement of the failure of the Seattle conference.We are now coordinating the PPE/DE faction's request to deduct the oral request for capital tax from the agenda.(The parliament rejects the application with 164 yes votes, 166 no votes and 7 abstentions.) Mrs. President, I would like to thank Mr. Poettering for stirring the advertising drum in favor of this pronunciation.Thank you.Mrs. President!Has my voice counted?I couldn't hand it over electronically because I didn't have the card.I voted ""for that"".In fact, if you add the two members who have registered, then result as a result ... Ms. President!The presidency announced the result of the vote.Changes are not possible.Mrs. President, in the earlier vote on the question of the commission's strategy plan - are not afraid that I will adhere to her decision in this matter - I asked to be able to speak in the name of my parliamentary group before voting.This did not happen.I would welcome it if I had the opportunity to end this business point to give an explanation for voting on behalf of my faction.That is an important matter.Perhaps it would make sense to keep in which what we just did is accepted by the individual against the background of their own political analysis.Mrs. President!I don't want to resume the debate, but I also reported to comment on Mr. Barón Crespo's application.You didn't call me either.I regret that, but the vote has been carried out, the decision has been made, so we leave things.I'm sorry, Mr. Hänsch and Mr. Cox.I hadn't seen them asked for the word.But the positions have become clear and are included in the protocol."	de
"The deputy rightly refers to the strategic importance of these regions.We take part in programs in the region that also affect the environment.There is a direct connection between our food programs and structural reforms in agriculture and the relief of poverty.These programs themselves are intended to help agriculture to receive a more solid basis and to stop predatory construction.We should continue to grant this ecological aspect priority in the future.We also take note of the fact that the MP who wrote the request has applauded the answer of the Commissioner.This is not common.In addition, the Lord has not cited a bibliography in this case.Thank you very much, Mr. Patten, for your today's contributions.Inquiry No. 35 of (H-0778/99): Concerns: Greek Action Plan for Employment According to the results of the evaluation of the action plans for employment, Greece and Italy are the most affected countries of critical comments from the Commission, both with regard to the inconsistency of plans as well as the measures and policies to support employment.The report indicates that in Greece and Italy the goals to improve the ""employment ability"" have not been achieved and it is uncertain whether the politics to be carried out are sufficient to prevent and combat long -term unemployment.With regard to Greece, it is also pointed out that there is no program for medium and long-term measures to reduce tax burdens and social security contributions in the area of ​​employment and for the satisfactory use of the ESF to support employment policy, and that there are also no exact employment figures.Can the Commission report whether the Greek government has adopted concrete obligations b and which B with regard to the way the problem of youth unemployment and long -term unemployment can be managed and whether it has set and implemented a suitable system for localization, registration and control of the fluctuation of unemployment or whether most measures are still limited to listing unemployment?To the request of Mr. Papayannakis: As part of the 1999 package of measures, the Commission has directed certain recommendations to Greece in order to make the measures to promote employment more efficient.These recommendations essentially suggest that more intensive efforts to reform public services in problem areas to improve the system of statistical recording and to apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the employment package.In the course of its employment policy, the Greek government announced two concrete programs in 1999: ""Yes to professional life"" and ""Back in Work"".Since there are no final results for these programs, we cannot first make a statement about whether the quantitative goals have been achieved.The Greek government now admits that there is a problem in that it is not possible to grasp the fluctuation of unemployment.It has therefore committed itself to, firstly, to restructure the state employment offices, secondly to create efficient centers for employment promotion - a corresponding program has started, but has not yet been completed - and thirdly, to introduce electronic employment cards and use suitable computer systems in order to be able to pursue the implementation of all of these policies."	de
It is about strengthening banking supervision.It is about clarifying liability for transactions.It is about a regulatory framework at the international level.It is about a review of national laws whether they correspond to the rules of the Basel Committee and how they can be spread more.In the present resolution, I have a major problem in a central point, which we cannot accept.This is point 9. If we have now listened to the Commissioner, we know that the commission's expertise will lead to a no to Tobin Tax.If the expertise and this debate and the arguments are as we do and how I think it is right, but then the Commission is also responsible for a further six months and thus an uncertainty of the financial and capital market.The capital market does not need uncertainty from us, the capital market needs clarity from us.Therefore, we reject point 9 and call for a separate vote.Mrs. President!The debate about taxing short -term financial transactions is not new.We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years, and yet this question is always up to date, because we need really concrete and honest answers on the basis of careful studies.We need to know how desirable and how feasible a taxation of short -term financial transactions is actually.This question is indeed in a different dimension today when $ 1,500 billion around the world vagabonds for 24 hours a day in search of attractive systems, and at most 3% of them are associated with the real economy.We worry about the stability of the financial markets, not for the sake of financial markets, but because it is also about our own growth, our own investments, our own jobs in the European Union.Here we have to ask which instruments we can use in order to actually create a certain order here that has been missing so far.We have contributed to the liberalization of the financial transactions, but we still have no functioning set of rules, and we have had to experience the bitterly in the effects of the Asia crisis and the Latin America crisis.It is therefore high time that on the one hand we think of supervisory rules and on the other hand of transparency on the financial markets and their information.It is important that we know which actors exist and what credit ratings they have.We also have to ask ourselves whether there is a commandment of tax justice.At a time when the tax burden on the factor work across Europe, but also internationally, we have to consider which forms we come to efficient taxation of capital gains in, and we also have to ask ourselves the question about the taxation of short -term financial transactions.I really think it is necessary that we will receive a careful report and a conclusion from the Commission so that we as a European Parliament can see whether we do not have to ensure that the European Union, together with the USA and Japan, really gets international solidarity in order to make the economy and the financial markets more stable and safer.	de
"Consequently, without such an active role in the ""development"" council in the global coordination of political decisions that develop on the sidelines of its decision -making center and directly affect the development policy of the European Union, it will certainly be difficult to develop a more coherent policy of the European Union compared to the development objectives.The speech and reflection of the European Parliament will certainly be appropriate and welcome here too.Let me start by saying a few words about the negotiations between the EU and the ACP countries that have successfully concluded.I would like to point out that participating in these negotiations was a very positive experience.I saw member states working as a team, a great experience indeed.The two parties were deeply satisfied at the end of the negotiations, not only because they had ended, but also because we all knew that we had accomplished something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.The world needs this and the signal sent is very positive as part of the general discussion on globalization.I will highlight some of the new features contained in this new agreement.We explicitly approach the question of corruption;We establish a framework in order to deal with the problem of immigration, for the very first time.We encourage participatory approaches, we ensure that civil society is consulted on the reforms and policies that the EU must support.We again focus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.We are not only based on the allocation of funds on an evaluation of the needs of each country, but also on an assessment of their performance in terms of policy.We create an investment system to support the development of the private sector.We rationalize the instruments and introduce a new rotating programming system that allows the community and beneficiary countries to regularly adjust their cooperation program.We decentralize administrative and sometimes financial responsibilities at local levels in order to improve cooperation.We improve the political framework for the development of trade and investments.We are strengthening cooperation in all sectors that are of commercial importance, including new points such as labor standards and links between the environment and trade.After Seattle, I am sure you will realize the meaning of these agreements.I now go to some of the more important points.First, the agreement concerning political issues.The new agreement will imply a firm commitment on the part of the two parties in terms of good management of the government as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject having to be the subject of a regular dialogue in a sector which benefits from the active support of the community.Second, a new procedure has been conceived in the event of human rights violations, democratic principles and the rule of law.In comparison with the current procedure, the new procedure puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and it allows greater flexibility in the consultation process, in order to carry out a productive dialogue leading to measures to be taken in order to redress the situation.In the event of a particular emergency, namely serious violations of one of these fundamental elements, measures will be taken immediately and notification will be made to the other party."	fr
Since I am chairman of the committee, which will apparently be treated almost exclusively in the next three years, but I have to ask: If Europe has the safest food control system, as you have said, why do we need 24 new Directives and Regulations and 20 new Change Directives? Secondly, does this not aggravate the problem of excessive regulation in Brussels and too little enforcement in Member States? We hope for a fruitful dialogue on this issue. In terms of expansion: How does the Commission intend to bring the applicant states in the debate on these new laws, given that the Commission obviously hopes that the laws planned in the White Book will be part of the Community Code by 2003? Mr President, I would like to first thank the member of Parliament Ahern, Roth-Behrendt and Jackson for supporting the white book. I consider it encouraging and I look forward to discussing more with them and other members of the Parliament. Ahern, a member of the Parliament, raised the issue of responsibility. In particular, the White Book does not address, with the exception of mentioning that we introduce the provisions - and some provisions already exist - which concerns traceability. After that, questions such as liability may be addressed. In spite of my background, I have not dealt with thoroughly or detailed issues related to liability, but it seems that this may well be related to subsidiary issues. However, I have noticed your proposal and will look at it later. Member of the Parliament Roth-Behrendt asked me about the prevailing list of substances. This is one of the issues we deal with in the Annex to the legislation and intend to draw up a list of substances allowed in the feed. The list is currently a list of prohibited substances and is supplemented as needed. The preparation of a list of permitted substances is one of the issues discussed in the Annex to which the time limit has been set, in fact, 2002. There is a quick alarm system for food but not for feed. It is regrettable and it is wrong, and we think it is important to detect it and create legislation to remedy the deficiency, and so do it. In the Member States, work on BSE disease is currently being done and plugs are being prepared to determine the level of infection. I know that Member of the Parliament Roth-Behrendt has asked me this before, and I said that it was progressing quickly, but I understand that this is now in the Commission in the inter-unit consultation phase and work is done all the time. I hope that the next time you ask me, I will be able to provide you with more detailed information. Jackson, a member of Parliament, focused on having 24 new and 20 previous laws and asked if he would aggravate over -regulation. I would say that the laws we mentioned are intended to replace the gaps in current legislation. It is not so much about the introduction of new systems or new regulations, even though it is part of it, but about finding out and patching the openings and loopholes in the chain in the chain. The speech mentioned the applicant states, and we have thought about this. The level of food safety as well as other security issues is of course very important for expansion, and I have brought this matter to the attention of the Commission Vehiaugen. Mr. Member of the Commission, the indifference of a few Member States, has driven us in a major food crisis in Europe, and I am, the Lord, again, once again annoyed that the Council is not present at all now that you present this interesting communication. I would very much like to know from you how you are going to make sure that the new agency, which is the official name ever, will also have the influence over the Council who has a say in this agency and who to share tasks.	fi
Madam President, I would also like to applaud the initiative that the Commission had to present a report to us on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends to correct, in subsequent documents, the excess of generalities and the imprecision of the text that we analyze today.That said, the president, I will again denounce the absence of the fishing policy, even if I am hardly listening to me.It is really surprising that the Commission does not place among its strategic objectives for the coming years the process of revising one of its common policies for the reform which must take place in 2002. This revision process is, without the shadow of a doubt, the most important event of those who will affect the fishing sector for many years.But, at first glance, this is not the opinion of the Commission, which is responsible for presenting to the Council and Parliament, before the end of 2001, the report on the functioning of the common fishing policy in the last decade, on the basis of which the Council will have to make the adequate decisions to modify it.In fact, the revision process has already started for many groups and institutions, as for the European Parliament which, in 1998, had already dictated and approved a report incorporating all the problems and faults that the common fishing policy currently includes.We have repeatedly asked for a minimum calendar for this revision but we did not obtain an answer.Less than two years, it is not much if we recall more that the fishing policy is experiencing an anomal situation with regard to internal market standards and that a solution should be found in these anomalies within the framework of the reform procedure.Consequently, the president, Mr. Chairman of the Commission, I request that this point, which is of paramount importance for such an important sector of the European Union, is taken into consideration in this strategy and in these strategic objectives for the next five years.Madam President, I also wish to address my congratulations to the Prodi Commissioner for her program.I am particularly delighted that it has recognized this virtuous circle that constitutes sustained growth: the information company within a European expansion market with, moreover, an effective single currency will give us the opportunity to really develop prosperity, the spirit of innovation, the business spirit and, yes - the most important element - of sustainable jobs with very high added value for European citizens.I have an observation, not a criticism, to formulate with regard to the declaration of this morning of the prodist commissioner, namely that she was a little weak on the real content of economic policy.We must not consider anything acquired with regard to the way of achieving the restructuring of the European economy.After all, what is social justice without full employment?Full employment is the best way to achieve social justice for our citizens.It is for us a fundamental priority on which we must concentrate our efforts.	fr
This is the proof, if it was still necessary, that an immature diplomacy, which defends no interest, except undoubtedly particular interests, stuck between the theology of free trade, the pressure groups and the NGOs more or less friendly, is not only effective, but dangerous.Finally, a word on the general inspiration of the Corrie report.Today the joint assembly is considered, do not hide it, as an obstacle to international free trade by theologians of Geneva and Washington.This was an opportunity to recall that our mode of cooperation with the countries of the South, original and exemplary, was to be developed, reinforced.This opportunity is an opportunity missed by the Corrie report and, with regret, we must sanction the fact that it has been lost to this point.Mr. President, as a conclusion and synthesis, I would like to highlight three essential aspects of this debate.First, the idea that emerges very firmly from all interventions is that globalization accentuates regional imbalances and social inequalities, that it increases poverty.It is therefore necessary to do something, under penalty of aggravating tensions and bringing out mechanisms triggering conflicts that call into question international peace and stability.Second, in this perspective, it would be important to give another dimension to development policies by valuing their role in the correction of imbalances, attenuation of inequalities.I think everyone agrees with the capital importance of the European Union role in development policies on an international scale.Everyone recognizes, such was the theme of today's debate, that the European Union assumes a more active and advanced role in development policies on an international scale, it will necessarily have to strengthen the coherence of its various policies which participate in development objectives.I think that certain interventions have also insisted that this responsibility vis-à-vis the coherence of European Union policies does not include exclusively on the Council, the Commission or the Parliament;On the contrary, it will have to be the subject of a consultation of the work of reflection and legislative and institutional preparation, both at the level of the Commission and at the level of the Council, as well as at the level of the European Parliament itself.Some deputies have also presented suggestions, such as that of the creation of an observatory or a working group to support the action of the various policies in the specific field of development.As was one of the priorities of the Portuguese presidency program, I would finally like to emphasize that it is also important to record the assertion that it is necessary to enhance the development policy in the context of European Union policies and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.We think it is absolutely essential;Otherwise, it will not be possible to develop a substantial action in terms of coherence of policies, if we are not able to give a leading role to development policies as an instrument for the affirmation of principles and values ​​that model Europe's assertion in the international system.	fr
We in the community, in the European Union have an important role here.Save is the only community -wide program dedicated to promoting rational energy use.It is based on non -technical elements and contributes to building an infrastructure for energy efficiency.The aim of the program is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency are promoted.At this point we also have to make ourselves aware that there is a market potential for energy saving in industry.We have heard a lot of competitive difficulties in renewable energy sources, but energy savings can be saved in the company, actually anywhere, money, so that this should not be a problem.This is something we can support.I have to say that, like motherhood, we all support this, but sometimes do very little to really help the mothers or those who are committed to saving energy.We could actually do more if we consider what major commitments we have received when reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases as well as when reducing the dependence on energy imports.We do not take the kind of measures that citizens want to see.We do not establish the necessary connection so that the citizens can actually do something at home or in the office or in the company to support the measures directed against climate change.If we could pass on this message, it would be a very exciting thing.I would like to thank everyone who has participated in this mediation procedure again.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!I would like to thank Ms. Ahern again for her work as a rapporteur, because with the participation of the other parliamentary members, she contributed to the fact that in the end there is a very reasonable result that in some aspects even improves one or the other proposal of the Commission itself and of course what the advice had initially accepted from the point of view of the household.As Ms. Ahern said correctly, both the budget for the Save program and the most symbolic budgets for the programs for the program are, because the weight bears the countries, the states of the Union, the regions or in some cases even the municipal administrations.But in any case, despite the relatively low volume, the programs have an important symbolic value that shows that there is a will in the community to support these types of measures that contribute to the fact that we really fulfill our commitments from Kyoto and also achieve more diversification in our energy sources, a stronger supply of supply and, if necessary, reduce consumption and higher efficiency in energy consumptionachieve a contribution to achieving the goals made.In addition, a technological challenge of the highest importance results in connection with the SAVE program SAVE higher efficiency and energy saving and with the program of old renewable energies, which can bring significant opportunities for industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and consequently throughout the Union.	de
But there are two points that I would like to mention here. On the one hand, I would like to emphasize the need to develop the concept of European citizenship due to residence in the map. Today it is more imperative that there is an urgent need to avoid coexistence in Europe of various categories of people with different rights. How it is e.g. Is it possible to accept for an Algerian who has been working and paying taxes in France for thirty years that he cannot vote in European municipal and community elections, when a European who has been living in another European Union country for six months can participate in them? This map must use every means to develop our definition of European citizenship based on the concept of residence. The rights we define must, in order to be fundamental, apply to everyone. On the other hand, I would like to insist on the urgent nature of importing on the map of an effective protection for automated personal data processing. The European Parliament actually voted for last month an amendment calling for a European Committee on Information and Freedom, which, in order to exist substantially, needs to be based on solid legal rules. The map must therefore ensure that the restrictions on the content of the files, the means allowed to collect information and ways of access to be determined. In addition, when some communication and espionage systems are condemned, we must guarantee citizens' rights to new European authorities who are being developed as well as their rights through parliamentary control, as well as consumer rights against new internet marketing techniques. There is a very serious serious issue for the guarantee of 21st century fundamental freedoms. Madam President, my speech will be very different from the previous speakers, since I would like to prove to you that the map of the fundamental rights of the European Union citizens, as presented in the European Parliament's Duff/Voggenhuber report, will actually limit fundamental rights. In essence, this report is proposed to include the rights of citizens who have been nationally set at a unified, detailed and binding European Charter, whose implementation will be controlled, and therefore interpreted by the Court of Justice of the European Communities. Before I go further, I must emphasize that I am not sure whether the body set by the Cologne European Council for the preparation of the map plan all other participants representing the heads of state and governments and national parliaments agree with this position. Therefore, what I will tell you only is the Duff/VoggenHuber exhibition. It is obvious that for supporters of the map, the defendant of fundamental rights, which are clearly protected today in Europe, whatever they say, is but a pretext that conceals another, purely ideological, goal: to set the basis for a European Constitution as a sealing of one of the European Constitution.	el
"In any case, if the Commission keeps an open three -year delay in the back gate, why do we have to do our duties then? Of course, we have also said that we want to be involved in this. We have submitted a revision proposal aimed at reducing this time for two years, and discussions with the Commission revealed that this is also in favor of this review. We have then found out as a phenomenon that you have provided us with extensive explanations on this commitology decision as extensive prose texts, even though you have long agreed with the Council that references to the articles must be made in a more scarce form. Thus, we have followed this invitation and this practice that you practice with the Council, and we are now, for our own behalf, after submitting a reference proposal in my name, in favor of accepting this new act. There is a special feature that you are, because Articles 37 and 152 are here as a legal basis, not only provided us with Article 17 (Article 17a), and has justified it by the fact that this is a consultation and a joint decision. Pursuant to this commitology decision, Article 8 shall apply, although not under Article 37. We believe that these two different proposals are not needed, and we have now submitted a single proposal for a review that I will now be informed of you. We support the removal of Article 17a. The proposal for the revision is to be as follows: ""When referring to this Article, the regulation procedure under Articles 5 and 7 and, where appropriate, in the joint decision procedure under Article 251 of the Convention, Article 99/468/EC shall apply. I hope the Commission can accept this review. We use the joint decision procedure. If the Commission and the Council may accept our review, we may use the abbreviated procedure, which may make sense, given the fact that since 1 July 1999 we have been in a slightly uncertain area of ​​uncertain. After all, we have already had vigorous discussions. I look forward to the result of your statement. I hope that you accept our thoughts that we have expressed in discussions, especially when we do not disagree. Mr President, we are dealing with checks presented here for a directive of internal cattle and pig trade. I would like to start by congratulating the rapporteur for his report and stating that I strongly agree with his recent observations. During the committee phase, I presented one review of which the committee approved and according to which Member States must establish appropriate plug -in tests, inspections and control system to ensure effective implementation of these regulations. In my review, the Commission is urging the Member States to make the necessary inspections provided for in these regulations, as if we want to organize a successful campaign to stop and eliminate tuberculosis and creation disease, it is necessary to ensure proper implementation of these regulations. I would also like to say that unfortunately, these regulations are currently mainly theoretical in the Member State I represent, because for four years we have not been able to export live cattle from the United Kingdom. In fact, even the exports of dead cattle are still blocked to certain countries, because even though the export ban from the United Kingdom was removed on 1 August 1999, France and Germany have been unlawful to this day, as we all know. Pork export stores also suffer because the pig industry has been in great trouble for the last two years. In my own country Scotland, the country's swine stock has decreased by 25 % over the last 12 months. Unless the United Kingdom's government will take action, it will decrease again by 25 % in the coming months. There have been several reasons for this terrible situation, such as the strength of the pound, the welfare and hygiene standards imposed by the United Kingdom Government, and the additional costs of the BSE crisis. These factors drive the UK swine breeders to the backup while the country's retail salesmen and supermarkets are increasingly acquiring cheap import products."	fi
Mr. President, the question asked by Mr. Karamanou is an extremely serious question, it must be said.We are fully aware of the humanitarian situation, difficult and dramatic, of Kosovo as well as from the problem of people displaced in the region, which come from Kosovo, with the repercussions that this leads in particular to the health of children and mortality rates.It is obvious to me that the European Union has clearly contributed to the efforts of humanitarian aid in the international community.As you know, the European Community has brought a total of 378 million euros only to the province of Kosovo, to which the national contributions of the various Member States must be added.This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and the health system, as well as in that of water sanitation.In addition, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which amounted to 66.3 million euros in 1999. I think that the honorable deputy knows that given the necessary division of labor between international donors, the health sector in Kosovo returns to the World Health Organization.This organization is fully aware, according to the reports it has written, of the alarming situation concerning the health of children.She focused her efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and hospitals.However, we are aware that this situation is far from being satisfactorily resolved;that it has a dynamic and a dimension which also affects other areas of health, which is more of the health of children.It is a situation of a political nature, it is not a simply technical situation, it concerns the solution of the political situation because there are dimensions here, which should not be hidden, which are reflected according to what is, until today, the inability of the international community to put into practice the functioning of a multi -thnical society in Kosovo, which has had harmful effects on the improvement of the health system in this region.Thank you, Mr. Chairman of the Council, for your answer which completes the remarks that he said yesterday on the subject of Commissioner Patten.However, Mr. President, the amount of 378 million euros, which you say he was allocated in 1999, proved to be completely insufficient for the creation of elementary human conditions in Kosovo, in particular with regard to the granting of health services.Do you not think, Mr. Chairman of the Council, that the mere fact that infantile mortality has increased constitutes for the European continent a withered, a shame which should all mobilize us, so that the aid that we bring is more effective and generous?Admittedly, the situation was not idyllic before the bombings, so much need, but it has been very clearly degraded since NATO intervention with regard to the natural environment and the human environment.Under these conditions, Mr. Chairman of the Council, is it not a question of moral order to strive to create human conditions for the residents so proven in Kosovo, and especially to hold all the promises we have made?	fr
Mr President, Mr Member of the Commission, Good Members of the Parliament, Member of the European Parliament, but basically Andalusia, one of the most tolerant and multi -racial regions of the Union and who has been receiving all those who have decided to stay there, and have not been born, and have not been born andAs a resident, all I can do is feel pain, fight and judge those anti -alien and racist events that are so foreign to the people of Andalusia. However, I would like to show how worrying the reality is: all decisions made or not made, all agreements that agree or omit the Community institutions and relate to the economic areas of the sub -production sectors such as Andalusia, may have an indirect impact on these such serious situations. For example, I refer to the fact that Morocco did not reach an agreement or a solution to the fishing industry, which is why some of the fishing ships stand in Almeria;I refer to the random way in which the Union handles the import arrangements of horticultural products and that a decisive influence on the relationship between Almeria and Morocco;And I refer to the immigration policy of the regions, the Member States and the Union, where measures or inactivity only causes areas such as Almeria to bear the pressures caused by the immigration of the magreb. For all these things that, unfortunately, have gathered in time and place, insensitive, intolerant and racist people, and hooligans found in the corner of all of us, and that the Creator, thanks to the minority, are able to raise alienation into the revelations of the alien. Good parliamentary members, all residents, whether they are European or not, are Andalusians if they live and work in Andalusia, and deserve our respect and values. The Union has to do a lot and it can do a lot. The southern is andalus for you, but for us Andalusians it is Africa, and our duty is to make sure that the Union uses all its potential resources for the southern economy to flourish and bring about social development that is more tolerant and more consideration. This has not been achieved with the proposed solutions so far, simply based on seeing only the other party. Mr President, Mr Member of the Commission, Good Members of the Parliament, I talk about my own experience that I have acquired many times in Ejido many times, and because I know how the situation has evolved there. Here in the European Parliament, as in many other institutions, we have followed the situation as worried, because we have groaned because we really felt the problem, because it is about our problem when we learned about what happened. Indeed, El ejido is a serious social and integration and division of labor, and what has been the most shocking, including a serious problem for citizens' safety. This has also knocked our conscience. Here in the European Parliament, Spain, and many other countries, we have all followed the events of the El ejido, but in fact what we are doing here or what we are talking about here is of no use, it is of no use, if we do not really get a more profound attitude, so that we can know the truth about what is going on, but Eljidon. We all agree that intolerance is unacceptable, but also that we have to look forward, and that we do not have to look for the culprits here in Parliament, and not many other places: El Ejido's events were guilty of the minority that has targeted his revenge on migrants.	fi
This does not interest the large groups of this Parliament, nor the major part of the unions, which in theory have in the defense of the European public service but which, in practice, focus on the corporate protection of their own registrants, using in questionable way the great powers which are granted to them.Union representatives are part of the disciplinary council and the status committee, so that the unfaithful civil servant risks nothing and to freeze the status.Union representatives are also part, and it is incomprehensible, juries of competition, and I would not be surprised if members of the union were already part of the Olaf, which would seriously harm this institution which should, at least formally, offer the guarantee of being super parts.So I understand why we meet at this hour, which is usually intended for other activities and not for debate, confrontation and information.Mr. President, when it comes to internal reform, the European Commission is in embarrassment.After the cases that prompted the previous commission to resign, the expectations are enormous.I sometimes have the impression that the proposals made within this assembly are all the more applauded as they are radical.On the other hand, the circumstances cannot be modified by a pen of the day overnight.As soon as it is a question of putting things to work, as soon as we must discuss on a few points of detail, we quickly see the difficulties arise.This is undoubtedly the reason why the budget control commission had to face more difficulties than expected on this point.However, we do not have to be ashamed of the result as it presents itself to you today.On this occasion, I would like to thank the colleague Van Hulten for the work he has accomplished on this report.If this report manages not to be once again watered down by the adoption of several amendments, it will make it possible to send the Commission for clear instructions and without detours on several determining points.Let's start with the most important education.We do not want to remove financial control.The financial controller must still have the possibility of doing his job before payments are done, not in all circumstances but in cases where uncertainties and risks exist.The Commission is launching a bad signal when it renames the Directorate General for Financial Control in general audit direction.The commission organization chart can easily be changed, but the task becomes more difficult when it is necessary to stick to the laws and, in this specific case, to the financial regulations.I did not carry out an exhaustive census, but the financial regulations of the community and the execution provisions which relate to it evoke in more hundred different passages the financial controller, its independence and the tasks assigned to it.These regulations cannot be ignored or bypassed, not even via a so-called soft law, as evoked by a colleague during a session in committee.	fr
It is obvious that some presidents do not pay attention to the hand signal, but immediately turn to the electronic voting system.I wonder if this is the correct approach.I know it takes longer, but shouldn't we in any case vote in any case with a hand signal?I assure you, awester colleague, that I will pay very close attention to how many hands get up.I hope that this is many at the time of the vote.Proposal for a guideline of the European Parliament and the Council on the adjustment of the legal provisions of the Member States on the labeling and presentation of food as well as the advertising for this (Kodified version) (KOM (1999) 0113 - C4-0212/1999/0090 (COD)) (Committee on Law and Inland Market) (Parliament accepts the commission.Proposal for a regulation (EC, Euratom) of the Council for the implementation of the decision 94/728/EC, Euratom on the system of own funds of the communities (Kodified version) (KOM (1997) 0652 - C4-0018/98 - 1997/0352 (CNS)) (Committee on Law and Innenmarkt) (the parliament is proposed by the Commission.)(A5-0106/1999) by Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on behalf of the fishing committee on the proposal for a prescription for the Council on the conclusion of the protocol to determine the catch options and the financial consideration according to the agreement between the European community and the government of the Democratic Republicfor the period from June 1, 1999 to May 31, 2002 (KOM (1999) 0550 - C5-0305/1999 - 1999/0228 (CNS)) (Parliament accepts the draft of legislative resolution.)

The environment is in a very, very serious condition.As I think, I would also like to respond to the economic problem and the financing of projects that, in my opinion, should be consistently in the public interest.To finance: 613 million euros are not enough, Ms. Commissioner.850 million euros are also not sufficient.At the end of August I took part in a meeting of the committee for environmental issues, public health and consumer policy, where even 2 million euros, which corresponds to 4,000 billion lire, for the removal or at least containment of the problem of nicotine addiction.Nevertheless, the environment is a much more serious, much more important problem than nicotine addiction.I assure you, Ms. Commissioner, 850 million euros - provided that this financial framework is actually approved - are not sufficient to advance any start of project in practice.In many places, protected areas have been set up that are a particularly important component of the Life program.But protected areas that with scarce financial means, i.e.h.Without signage, being set up are ineffective and pointless.Hence my request to Parliament and the Commission to pay great attention to this question.President, Dear MPs!Since the beginning of 1999 there have been talks between the individual organs about the proposed regulation for a third phase of the financing instrument for the environment.I would like to thank the environmental committee and Ms. Lienemann again for the good and constructive cooperation on this matter.As a result, I can say that the commission in principle is in good spirits nine of the fourteen proposals in the environment.The Commission primarily welcomes the amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, to the committee proceedings.In this case, the parliament reacted to the commission's objections to a common point of view.In principle, the Commission can also accept amendment 4, which should appear in the text in another place.As for change applications 5 and 6, I would like to emphasize that the projects for the sustainable management of groundwater and surface waters as well as the projects for reducing climate -relevant air pollutants are highly contained in life.However, the Commission is of the opinion that its separate performance is opposed to the original decision to concentrate the proposal on a few areas that are given priority.There is also a risk of overlap with other community campaign programs, such as the fifth supporting program for research, technological development and demonstration.The central measures of this program - water quality, city of the future and innovative products and processes - sometimes refer to the same questions.Regarding the budget question, I am happy about the trust shown by the environmental committee.A larger financial framework is required in amendment application than proposed in the common point of view.I am also convinced of Life's great potential.This instrument should be able to finance good projects with a larger amount than the proposed financial framework.However, the amount listed in amendment 12 does not match the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.Also let me mention that an extended financial framework also places higher demands on the direction of the environment, which then has to look after a larger number of projects.In addition, other programs must also be taken into account that is decided in the context of the co -decision process.	de
These countries want to together together 50 tonnes of C restramid. We urgently call on the Commission and the Member States not to agree with this proposal. The list of areas where illegal hunting hunting is so wide that the legalization of hunting will only exacerbate the problem, while the total population of African elephants has fallen to 20 years from 1.3 million to 625,000 animals. As is well known, we have now reached a critical limit. A second danger I would like to point out is that Norway and Japan's proposal will again be allowed to hunt the Minke Whale in the North Atlantic and the South Pacific. We are opposed to this proposal, even because both of these two countries are already hunting for these beautiful animals. If we accept the proposal we will only reward their bad behavior. In addition, the rhetoric is a threatened species, so it is preferable to comply with the agreement on the protection of whales. Finally, I come to the third example. Cuba requested that the Hawksbill Turtle be transferred to Annex II. This proposal is the result of a very short -sighted visa of an animal that is generally threatened with extinction. Because this species goes mainly to Cuba to give birth, people believe that its population is sufficient and want to kill 500 turtles a year and you know why, to sell them to expensive restaurants in Japan. This act would be a very important impetus for the illegal hunting. Cuba should be ashamed of the proposal she has not even harmonized with the ideology she is defending, with which I by the way disagree. These are shortly three examples from a series of suggestions that raise particular concerns in Nairobi. We call on the Commission and the Member States not to support these kinds of proposals, but to maintain the CITES contract as it is. Let's start this century in a good and not bad way, and let's take care not to threaten the existence of more plants and animals.(Gue/ngl).(Es) Mr President, as the previous speaker said, with this resolution we are addressing the Contracting Parties of the CITES Convention, which will meet in Nairobi in April. And we are addressing them, to try to protect the endangered species, such as the Asian Peddle, the Congo Gorillas, the elephants - due to the sale of ivory - and other species mentioned in the resolution. I will briefly refer to three necessary measures that should be taken in Nairobi in the coming days. The first concerns the information and awareness of public opinion, buyers and sellers. The second concerns sanctions mechanisms for those who have not yet adopted legal measures that prohibit non -imposition of penalty, especially to poachers. And the third concerns cooperation with developing countries, in the rural areas of which there are sometimes other means of living by smuggling and the movement of endangered species. NL) Mr President, the protection of endangered species of fauna and flora is more than protecting natural wealth.	el
All of this corresponds to the principles that we have always defended.Thank you very much, Mr. Segni, I would like to do that.This is in the spirit of the position that we have always represented as a parliament.Mrs. President!I would like to draw your attention to a case with which this parliament has repeatedly dealt with.That is the case of Alexander Nikitin.We are all pleased here that the court has acquitted it and made it clear that access to environmental information in Russia is also a constitutional right.Now it is the case that he should be charged again because the prosecutor is in appeal.We know and we have found it in really many decisions - especially during the last plenary conference of the past year - that this is not just a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin Nikitin crime and betrayal because we, as those affected, have a benefit from his results.These results are the basis for the European programs to protect the Barentsee, and that's why I ask you to examine a draft letter that describes the most important facts for you and make this position clear in the sense of the decisions of the parliament in Russia.Ms. Schroedter, I am happy to check the related facts if you have your letter.Ms. President, first of all, thank you for having a say and now the range of television programs in our offices is actually enormously expanded in the first period of the new year.Nevertheless, Ms. President, my wish was not met.We can now receive two Finnish and one Portuguese, but still no Dutch broadcaster.However, I had asked you for a Dutch program, because we Dutch, too, would like to follow the news if we are sent here every month.So I would like to ask you again to ensure that a Dutch broadcaster is also fed in.Ms. Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this point is on the agenda of the Quärtors on Wednesday.I hope that you will be decided there in your sense.Ms. President, can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the occupational safety regulations that it has said goodbye?Why hasn't the air quality in this building have been checked once?Why hasn't the occupational safety committee come together since 1998?Why did a fire protection exercise not take place in the Brussels or in the Strasbourg parliament building?Why don't fire protection instructions take place?Why was nothing done after my accident to make the stairs safer?Why is the smoking ban not enforced in the non -smoking zones?It is a shame that we say goodbye to the rules that we do not stick to ourselves.Ms. Lynne, you are absolutely right and I will check whether all of this is really that way.I will also submit the question to the Quärtors.I am sure that this great emphasis attaches great importance to the legal provisions that we say goodbye to ourselves.Mrs. President!Ms. Díez González and I had made some inquiries about the vice president, Ms. de Palacio, which was reproduced in a Spanish newspaper.	de
We obviously talk about the matter mentioned by a valuable member. We have heard that this has been a concern and I make sure that it is taken up. The potential threat to the area's archaeological heritage has also raised a lot of concern. We will talk about it as we make objections. Other hydropower projects that have been carried out in Turkey in the last 30 years have highlighted concerns, such as farmers' displacements. All in all, these concerns have apparently been solved quite satisfactorily, and I hope that the same goes for this project that I just want to make this clear - the Commission does not participate in any way. We thank the Commission member Pattenia for answering these questions on behalf of the Commission. Question No. 39 (H-0036/00): Subject: I want to express my satisfaction on behalf of the civil society due to the preparation of a fundamental rights book and the wish that the fundamental rights book can meet the challenges of the 21st century Europe, and ask the Commission: What is its position on the content of the Charter? Is the Fundamental Rights Book intended for EU citizens or for all European citizens, taking into account future enlargement, and does it also apply to immigrants? Is the fundamental rights book a part of the Community Code or does it have a broader programmatic basic nature? What mechanisms are used to strengthen gender equality? What does the Commission think about the inclusion of the Charter of the Charter in the European Union Agreement? Like a member of a valuable parliament, the Commission is happy for the decision of the States and the principals of the government to launch the process of drawing up the European Union's Charter of Fundamental Rights. The principals of the States and Governments themselves confirmed the guidelines of the content of this Charter in the European Council of Cologne themselves. According to these conclusions, the fundamental rights book must include three types of rights: the rights of freedom, equality and procedure as they are guaranteed in the European Convention on Human Rights, only the rights of the Union citizens, and the economic and social rights, as included in the European Social Book and the Governance of the Social Rights of Employees, not only. The Commission is of the opinion that the preparatory body, which is responsible for the preparation of a fundamental rights book, must comply with the assignment of the Cologne European Council. However, this does not mean that the preparatory body should only be limited in its mission to bring together the current rights from different sources. As I have already had the opportunity to say in this Parliament, the Commission is convinced that, if necessary, the preparatory body must be able to adapt and develop these rights by taking into account current conditions, and in particular technical and social development. However, it is due to the assignment and the final objective of the text to be presented to the principals of the States and Governments that this authority must be used cautiously and on a case -by -case basis. There are at least two types of beneficiaries of this fundamental right. Some rights apply to all those present in the Union in the Union, while other rights are again enjoyed by the Union citizens. We could also think that certain economic and social rights would be guaranteed solely to the Union citizens and to those third countries who meet certain conditions. In the early stages of the preparation of the Fundamental Rights book, it is not possible to form a more detailed preconceived notion of the content of the Charter. However, we may assert that, for example, the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women is certainly one of the rights guaranteed in the Union's future fundamental rights of fundamental rights, as it is already included in the rights that are guaranteed in the Convention on the Establishment of the European Community and the derived law, and as it is certainly part of the common state of the Member States. As I have already said in this Parliament, the Commission is in favor of incorporating the Charter in the Charter in the Treaty. However, it is fully aware that the final decision in this matter is for the heads of states and government. Thus, the difficult task of the preparatory body is to produce an ambitious and politically significant text that can be included in the establishment agreement as such.	fi
This is my current review. It may be discussed here and elsewhere, and I listen to all the proposals that are made, but my preliminary conclusion is that this authority should be located in central parts of the Union than in the peripheral areas. Good colleagues, I'm in a very difficult situation because I can't change the agenda. I would suggest that you would raise this issue in your political group and the meeting of the Presidency. If you think that these post -Commission sessions are important, I would suggest that we would take more time than half an hour for them. This time, the questions of the Parliament members lasted six minutes and the members of the Commission member and the communication of 29 minutes. As you can see, a half hour is by no means enough for such a session. I hope you could discuss this in your political group so that we can plan a session with the Commission in the future. The discussion has ended. Question Time (Commission) on the agenda is the following questions to the Commission (B5-0003/2000). I will inform you that we will book about an hour and 15 minutes for this Question Time. We will slightly shorten its duration as interpreters make a long day today. Member of Parliament Purvis has a speech for the procedure proposal. I oppose that we shorten the time spent on Question Time;It is one of the few occasions when line MPs have the opportunity to have a speech time, and I ask you to extend it to an hour and a half, as the agenda says. The agenda is like that, and I think we should stick to the agenda. Good colleague, the thing is that we read on the agenda that we would start at 5:30 pm and you will see what the clock is. In any case, I hope that we will not have to continue with a night session. The first part question # 28 (H-0781/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in Turkey The earthquake-sensitive area in Turkey recently had two earthquakes, which were more than seven on the Richter scale. The fact that Turkey intends to build extremely expensive nuclear reactors in the battery area, and that the energy resources generated by Atatürk dams are exported to third countries while at the same time, while cutting the EU, wasting funds to repair earthquake damage. The plans for Turkey's nuclear power ignore the hazards of the inhabitants and ecosystems of Turkey and the surrounding extensive area, and these plans arouse doubts about the secret plans of the Turkish political-military leadership to acquire nuclear technology, which gives rise to the opportunity to develop nuclear weapons. It should be borne in mind that Turkey strives to build reactors of Canadian origin that correspond to the reactors purchased by India and Pakistan. What steps are the Commission to take to avoid nuclear accidents and prevent the spread of nuclear weapons in a country that wants to join the EU and is wasting huge numbers of nuclear programs, but at the same time sucks EU funds granted as financial assistance? The Commission Member Vehineen has a speech..(EN) The Commission is interested in plans to build a nuclear power plant in a battery, Turkey, and admits that it is important to ensure that the construction of the new power plant is complying with the highest internationally approved nuclear safety standards. According to the information we received, the choice of the contractor has not yet been decided. The Commission recognizes the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the Nuclear Safety Convention, and states that the granting, construction, ordering, use and decommissioning of nuclear power plants is entirely the responsibility of the Turkish atomic energy authority. The Commission does not have the authority to restrict any country's energy production, including the decisions of the nuclear power option. As a member of the Commission, Wallström stated in his hearing at the European Parliament in September 1999, the Commission in the future will raise the issue of nuclear safety and radiation protection with all the meetings with the Turkish government, and I will be pleased to inform you that I will meet the Turkish Foreign Minister in a couple of days and I will take the question. The Commission is particularly aware of the general concerns related to the seismic activity found in the Ecemis fracture line near the possible location of the power plant.	fi
It sets long -term goals, as well as intermediate target values, in terms of ozone in the air of the environment. It also introduces a framework of patterns aimed at protecting human health and environment. Finally, it calls on Member States to control ozone rallies as well as to notify the results. The directive will therefore be a reference point for ozone levels in the air of the environment. In order to determine the long -term objectives, the Commission proposes the use of the guidelines adopted by the World Health Organization in 1997 for air quality. The first purpose is to prevent the exceeding these ceilings and thus to avoid the harmful effects on human health and the environment. However, the committee's proposals do not specify a date on which they must be implemented. We are sorry for that. First, target values ​​are set. The purpose is to achieve these prices, if possible, by 2010. These prices are also based on its guidelines which, but it is acceptable that it may be exceeded for a few days each year. It should be emphasized that the Commission's proposal does not take into account the changes that may arise from community commitments in the field of climate change. These commitments provide for a decrease of 8% of the gases responsible for the greenhouse effect. If these commitments are respected, Member States must address the target prices for reducing ozone levels. In conclusion, I am quite satisfied with the text of this Directive proposal, because it is an important step towards achieving the primary objective set in the fifth environment for the environment: to never exceed critical ozone levels in the air of the environment. MYLLER (A5-0063/2000) exhibition today we are discussing a legislative proposal that concerns us all immediately, as it aims to improve the environment of the environment. This is a directive on national emissions for some atmospheric pollutants (a directive under the air-quality directive). It is enrolled in the fifth Community Action Program for the Environment (MSc). The major goal is to limit emissions of pollutants that cause acutes and eutrophicism and ozone precursors to improve environmental protection and human health from harmful effects caused by the observation, soil eating and the troposphere ozone. The ceilings mentioned in this text should be respected by 2010 at the latest. With this perspective, Member States must draw up programs for the progressive reduction of annual broadcasts in their territory and announce them to the Commission before the end of 2002.2010, and inform, on a regular basis, national broadcast census catalogs and provisions on sulfur emissions (SO2), nitrogen oxides, volatile organic compounds (VOC) and Ammonia (NH3). These lists and forecasts must be notified to the Commission every year. The rapporteur proposed amendments aimed at enhancing this proposal. It is mainly recommended to determine more stringent patterns that should be respected in terms of the emission of these four pollutants. As for the principle, I am fully in line with such proposals. Indeed, when it comes to health and the environment, we have to be optimistic if we want to argue that we improve the situation.	el
.(PT) Mr President, Mr. Member of the Commission, Good Colleagues, I think it is very important that the European Parliament participates in the debate on how the European Union will take the opportunities that the information society offers this theme at the Lisbon Summit. While I emphasize that many would expect clear answers from the Employment Summit in this matter, I do not underestimate the importance of the subject and the need to define a European strategy for the industry. We also all know that in this very sensitive and central region of the future, the Union has been well behind the United States. I agree with the Parliament's Read in the report presented to us and emphasize the expression of the council chairman António Guterres using the three main deficits in the industry. First, pragmatic deficiency. As the Read's report successfully states, the document proposed by the Commission is full of general trends and intentions that deserve our support, but it is weak in concrete actions and sanctions. I wouldn't like to believe that the final conclusions of the Council would remain at this level. We do not need statements and speeches in this matter as well as in others, but activities and decisions that help reduce the gap that separates us from the United States. The second is the democracy gap. Here, too, there is a democracy deficit that has been greater, but it is important to prevent the distribution of those who can utilize the Internet, new technology and information society, and to those for whom it is blocked for either financial reasons or due to lack of knowledge or technical skills. Investing in a breeding system, as well as in transport and telecommunications structures that make the Internet cheaper, faster and more useful, are priorities that must be first in our thoughts. Lastly, an investment gap. As the report successfully states, solving these problems cannot be left to the market. In the health care system, public administration, relationships between states and citizens, and in the area of ​​public services in general, much can and should be done to make Europe switch to quality thinking that we all recognize here. Mr President, an extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Lisbon in the coming week, is about defining their own path that Europeans will travel in future working life. How will we become more competitive? How do we create new markets? How do we create jobs that require higher education permanently? We can play a major role in tomorrow's global information society if we manage the software. Europe has gifts. Europe has talents. It sometimes lacks qualified motivation instructors. It is important to me that large target groups are actively involved in very significant changes. They need to familiarize yourself with the Internet and databases from a young age. My colleague's massage was already referred to. There must be rarities from schools with no computers! We need training activities that include computer -assisted learning and active use of information networks. The Employment and Social Committee of the European Parliament is in favor of becoming the spiritual property of all citizens, including socially marginalized, disabled people and older people, from the information society. The rate of change in the European economy is accelerating. Businesses are constantly restructuring, participating in cooperation, strategic unions, and friendly or hostile invasion. Their consequence is the same for the employee and the leader: great mobility and faster adaptation. Independence grows, but also apparent independence. Businesses change responsibilities. Teams have increasingly stricter deadlines. It affects the internal cohesion of employees and the advocacy of interests. Many companies are too small for the establishment of business councils, or they are so large that there are not even connections and shop stewards become travel priests. People working in the professions of information and communication technology with a lot of freedom, analysts, engineers or creative designers, want to lead themselves. They are seeking new working time rules and new pay and reward systems based on flexible agreements. In addition, trade unions are afraid in other areas that unregulated structures are becoming more common and social standards are decreasing.	fi
It should not be just an empty threat. You should do it if the Member States are not responsible for responsibly. I come from a Member State that benefits from European funding, but I am shocked by its achievements of the Directive, the Habitat Directive, and the implementation of several other directives. We make the most complaints per capita. It was already time for the European Commission to take action and decide that funding should be suspended if the rules do not want to be followed. Let it be that this has an impact on my own country. Member States must comply with European rules. The previous Commission members wrote to the Ireland Board as follows: If you do not have areas to protect your list, how can we assess whether your national plan is in agreement with European directives when you deliver it? You have to stick to this. If Member States are not willing to comply with directives, interrupt the funding. I would support you 100 %. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, the European Union, finances too many projects and programs that do not meet the objectives of sustainable development and nature conservation set up by the establishment and regulations. And it is easily discovered: on the other hand, we hand over almost half of our funds to be taken over by agriculture, with the truth of being constantly funding for productivity efficiency, but ignoring organic and broad agriculture. On the other hand, we consume one third of our funds to the Structural Funds, when the truth is that projects funded through them are the first to break the habitat of the living environment. Portugal is a good example of this, and because it is a good example, it is worth explaining well. Portugal is not only intervened by the final list of protected areas to be included in the Natura 2000, which is important to the community, but also all mandatory plans, rules and mechanisms to protect and manage the sites already selected. In other words, the Portuguese destinations that are already part of the Natura 2000 network are perfectly at the mercy of unscrupulous economic groups and builders, because the tools to protect them are missing. The most serious case is the tourism company, which has been granted permission to operate in the Abano area in the Sintra-Cascais Park and to which I ask the Commission immediately. However, the Mr President and the Dear Members, in Portugal today, the state is preparing to carry out projects in places that have been incorporated by the European Union or is incorporating on the Natura 2000 network and some receive its funding from the Structural Funds. Unfortunately, what is happening in Portugal is not unique, it's just a good example. So I hope that the Commission exercises its legal powers and does not accept the third support frame of the community to fund anything before Member States send their Natura 2000 list. Mr President, this debate is about whether the EU commitment to sustainable development in theory really means something in practice, and whether we are ready to make some very difficult decisions in a tight spot. The idea of ​​sustainable development should be to integrate economic development into environmental aspects. The EU is committed to this in countless agreements since the Rio Environmental Summit. Article 6 of our own EC agreement obliges us to do so - to integrate these policies. The essence of this debate concerns the imposition of economic development with environmental obligations. We have to make increasingly tougher decisions about this. It will be an excellent experiment that shows what our commitment to sustainable development really means. We recently discussed the consistency of EU policies in plenary session. Many parliamentary members rightly emphasized the importance of policy consistency, but here again we have a great example of policy harmonization. As a result, the Greens are very strongly supported by this resolution of the Committee on the Environment. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, I followed your speech attentive, but I did not fully understand it. I'm going to read the Commission's Communication very carefully. Maybe you can help me understand it.	fi
It is a country with difficult internal problems between ethnic groups to be solved, which it is increasingly handling. I would like to emphasize that we can congratulate Macedonia for exemplary minority legislation and the processing of minorities, and that the consistent binding of the 30 % albanic population to government work, government policy and society is a prerequisite for a peaceful coexistence in Macedonia. I am delighted that the wish presented by Swoboda, a member of Parliament, in his report, will be fulfilled in early March that will eventually be created by the EU delegation that we will eventually be raised there to the European Union. I think the launch of these negotiations on stabilization and association process is a logical decision of the successful and good development of this country. In the end, Macedonia must be able to know in practice in our political activity that we also reward it with its own commendable regional cooperation by launching real regional projects. I only mention two small ones: the rapid solution to the Kosovo border crossing problems in Blace and the implementation of the corridor 8, that is, from Albania via Macedonia to Bulgaria. I consider the colleague Swoboda report to be excellent and I can completely agree with his opinions. Dear President, I also want to congratulate colleague Swoboda for his report. I think it is a good thing that so many of us express their support for the perspective of his choice. This is about striving for the stability of the area in a structural way and is aimed at the agreement with the Macedonia Republic that we are dealing with today. Although the actual implementation of the stabilization agreement is still ahead, the Commission has quickly exploited the development of a new tool, ie the stabilization and association agreement. It is used to initiate stabilization of the former Yugoslavan states through contracts. This is a matter of countries with which no pre -joining agreement can yet be concluded. The present agreement is actually a pre -contract agreement, but it still provides a perspective on future membership. Binding countries with active agreements is an excellent tool if the provisions of the agreements are constantly followed in order to provide the desired stability. Macedonia remains a potential restlessness, as it has been in the past. However, it has a desire to get rid of that reputation. It requires internal stability. The new government wants to be discussed and the contract may be the initiator of the reforms, including the direct impact and equal position of the Albanic minority. Above all, the country now needs peace to get its inner affairs in order and find the way to well -being. Especially we Social Democrats appeal to the opposition to behave according to these perceptions. It has to support so much praised Macedonia model here. However, the country also needs, and above all, external stability. What is the benefit of internal stability if the environment is unstable? That stability is needed in the relationship between Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria. It must be acknowledged in the area that Macedonia exists and remains. External stability means open boundaries and regional cooperation. Minorities and majority must provide room for human and cultural exchange. Macedonia's stability is closely linked to the development of neighboring countries. Kosovo's problem is known, the international community is represented in many people in Kosovo. It seems that Albania is underestimated. The Union does not consider the time to be ripe for the conclusion of a stabilization and association agreement with this country. But then what? It is precisely the arguments that baptize the agreement with Macedonia, but not Albania, make us so worried that we cannot really accept the waiting position of the Union in relation to Albania. What does the Commission do with these reasoning? Yugoslavia is also a weak stability factor and threatens stable Macedonia. We have to wait for what's going on there. Mood in Belgrade becomes more unpredictable day by day. We also support the Council's decision to give sanctions a different emphasis. At least in the end, this aims to provide real support for the opposition that is preparing for new demonstrations.	fi
"These general remarks being made, I would like to concentrate my point, about Interreg, on your main remarks.The former are linked to the calendar and the content of this initiative.You say that the adoption of these guidelines was too late, and the risk of interruption of previous programs has been underlined, in particular by your rapporteur.It is true, I recognize it, and you know what are the reasons, ladies and gentlemen European deputies.There is a delay in the adoption of Interreg's orientations in March-April 2000. I recognize it, I take note like you.However, I observe that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the Interreg III programs and the orientation project was also distributed more than three months ago.I also observe that the eligibility of expenses will be admitted from the date of presentation of the programs and I confirm the possibility of retroactivity until January 1, if this program is presented before April 30.So much for the first remark.Second remark: Regarding the non -exhaustive list of eligible measures for component B, I want to tell you and confirm that I have asked the Commission to accept to include other specific themes, in particular in favor of small and medium -sized enterprises or cultural heritage, in the list of actions eligible for component B and therefore no longer consider this list as exhaustive.Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of component C. The Commission shares the observations that have been made by your assembly on the importance of this C section, of interregional cooperation.As your rapporteur wishes, I will send you detailed information on the implementation system of this component.Fourth note: the observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.As you asked, I decided to delete any reference to the use of a technical assistance office in the text, while waiting for the debate, in progress within the Commission, on the service outsourcing systems finds its outcome.But, ladies and gentlemen deputies, if we delete any reference and, later, any use of a bat, it has a consequence, which must be the increase in certain officials of civil servants to do this work, because someone will have to do it and I will not be able to redeploy the same personnel indefinitely, even though our tasks increase with ISPA and with the concern to better control, with rigor and transparencyCommunity credits, for which I have the charge, often in partnership or in co -responsibility with the Member States.Now being the implementation of Interreg, a subject that has been mentioned by many of you, and the possible eligibility for component A, ""cross -border cooperation"", actions in the Adriatic, for Sicily or for the UlTrapipheral regions, the Commission, ladies and Gentlemen, understands your concerns and hears your request on these different points.So I intend to modify the guidelines to integrate into the transnational component B a specific priority: ""Integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions"", so as to cover, in order, it seems to me, appropriate, the different possibilities of cooperation between these regions."	fr
"Mr. Chairman of the Council, I sincerely thank you for the complete answer you asked this question by referring to the programs that, as you reminded us, have been implemented. But to the question, it was emphasized that it was a problem that has become more serious last, precisely because of the border permeability. That it is a smuggling that comes mainly, from the eastern candidates for integration, that they are the majority of women illegal, that it is a migration under the worst conditions and that these women are in a state of despair and that they are victims of all sorts of problems and marginalization. I believe that there has been an effort in recent years, but I insist that special attention should now be paid now and prevention for the future, since - and this is to be expected - this is a problem that will be exacerbated. Mr President, I would simply like to add that I fully agree with what the MPs said and that the Union takes care, in the context of the negotiations in view of enlargement, and in particular in the context of its external relations in the fields of justice and domestic affairs, to develop with the candidates and the candidates with the candidates and the candidates toillegal immigration. Without questioning the need for the European Union to follow a policy that will promote the tolerance for immigrants and encouraging the reception of economic refugees, but we believe that we should try to avoid the possibility of creation, thanks to the conveniences of the aforementioned politics,of various forms of organized crime that are precisely associated with the free movement of persons. We believe that the work that has been done, as well as the awareness of the candidate countries of the importance that, during the period preceding their accession, to maintain and further develop common control mechanisms and common efforts with the European Union on these cases, will contribute to the achievement of the results. I believe that the Commission pays particular attention to this issue and I appreciate that the fact that the dialogue will open, specifically during the semester of the Portuguese Presidency, with the countries that are included in the so -called Luxembourg team for various chapters that relate to this issue, especially on the subject,A common perception that, after all, will later need to be accepted by the candidate countries, if they are called upon to comply with the community acquis. Adding my thanks to the Council for his answer earlier, I would like to draw the council's attention on a relevant issue. The BBC has recently provided evidence that Romania was sold ""womb"", as it described them - that women were paid to give birth to children who would export to Member States of the European Union. In addition, the BBC claimed that this was done with the implicit approval of the Romanian authorities because it brought a strong currency to Romania. Will the Council mention the issue as part of its dialogue with Romania on Romania's request to become a member of the community?"	el
Anyone who supports himself with prejudice against foreigners and minorities and feeds these prejudices, programmed by narrow -mindedness and prejudice, which cherishes the sophisticated behavior and arrogance in international relationships and has never made a common and clear nesting difference in national socialism, neither intentional and prepared for national socialism!(Applause) Conservatives have committed the great historical mistake that they have voluntarily gone to bed with the wolf and wait until they are eaten. So the wolf - although the Austrian People's Party (ÖVP) sacrifice - is fed instead of curbing it. I understand that Europe and the civilized world want to deal with such a government as little as possible. However, there is also another Austria, the Austria that has shown its mind in the form of several thousands of people against participating in the government of the Austrian Freedom Party FPE and will continue to protest against this government. I ask Europe to support and help this Austria!(The applause) the stronger Europe becomes, and the more alert it follows authoritarian trends in Europe, the more successful we can fight against the roots of extreme rightism. For Europe is now and in the future the strongest guarantee of xenophobia and folk or even returning to barbarism. Support the people of Austria against this government!(Applause) Mr President, this moment is historic, because now it is now all clear to all of us that the European Union has gradually developed into a community of values. We are noticing this now that one Member State Board is becoming a party that is known that it does not respect all these values. I also want to say that the fourteen state statements from the Council were justified, as this is also a matter of the composition of the European Union government, which is also the case with the Council, not just an internal issue in Austria. As members of the Parliament, in particular, we must emphasize that the work started to strengthen fundamental rights is even more important. It is even more important that the respect and insulting of human dignit and the rights of minority, including the rights of all people in the European Union, are an integral part of the rule of the European Union, and therefore, the document of fundamental rights must also be made legally binding. It must not only remain a declaration. It is equally important to support the democratic forces of Austria, after all, none of us wants to isolate Austria. We know that most Austrians respect these values. They have also shown their mind;Not all demonstrations have occurred outside Austria. There are certainly a lot of protest voters on the move, who have long wanted a change in Austria politics. In my opinion, Parliament should support these democratic forces. I also appeal to the President of Austria that he would still explore all the possibilities to reassemble the government of democratic forces. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, I would just like to emphasize the value of the attitude that our group chairman Francis Wurtz mentioned a moment ago. I appreciate the resolution of the chairman of the Council and the position of 14 Member States, as they refuse to have official relations with the Austrian government, if the Jörg Haider party is taken to the government. This emphasis is all the more important because we, as we are known, significantly disagree with the policies practiced in Europe: its economic and social policy, its democracy deficit, the involvement of these same states in the dramatic war in the Balkan region. This difference in views even more emphasizes the value we express today: it is an exceptional fact, as the threat to the new rise of the irrational and neo -Nazi element in Europe is also exceptional. This danger does not only apply to Austria, but to Europe as a whole. We talk about ourselves, not from Austria. We know the social reasons that, together with unemployment and uncertainty, strengthen the tendency in that direction;We know its cultural partial reasons - the xenophobic, racist causes - but we cannot help but discover the inability of these extreme right -wing forces and the reluctance to make an account with Nazism, the possibility that Europe may create an explosive mix.	fi
Negotiations in Austria for the Constitution of the Government The agenda calls for the debate on negotiations in Austria with a view to the government's constitution.I immediately give the floor to the President in office of the Council.Madam President, the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Chairman in office of the Council, the group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to send three messages to European public opinion today.Whether it is clear: we are deeply united with regard to these three messages.First, we want to specify that we fully support the declaration of the presidency in the exercise of the Council and the 14 Member States and that we identify ourselves, because it responds to the community of values ​​which was built by all of us, and not by a single political force.Anyway, it is a community of values ​​which is contrary to that defends by this party, which has ironically baptized freedom of freedom.The Europe that we currently build is precisely the result of bitter experiences that we have all suffered and the socialist group condemns the insults addressed to the President of the French Republic and to the Belgian government, but also to the socialists, also European citizens, because, ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian socialists are now accused of trahison to their homeland.I will tell you one thing: for many years, I betrayed my homeland, that's at least what General Franco said.President Guterres also betrayed Salazar.It seems necessary to me that the PPE affirms and defends it.In addition, I think that the Commission, Mr. Prodi, was a guardian of the treaties.But I remind the President Prodi that during the investiture debate, he spoke of the Commission as a European government.However, a government must have more nerve and courage.This is what I ask the Prode President for the moment.(Applause) Unless I owe to a commissioner as effective as Mr. Fischler, according to some rumors - it all depends on the language in which they are expressed -, President Prodi would have asked for the resignation of Mr. Fischler.I will be grateful to you to clarify this point in front of the Parliament.Second, Madam President, we want to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.A call for the majority of the Austrian people who did not vote to Haider, who voted for clearly democratic parties, engaged in the European project I would like to point out that if Mr. Schüssel was Minister of Finance, Chancellor Vranitzky also played a role in the integration process of Austria.In politics, you cannot show as much sectarianism.It is together that we allowed the entry of Austria into the community.It is the work of all and not of a single group.Consequently, Madam President, we believe that it is our right and our duty to ask Austrians to rethink their choice, this kind of plague which we have already suffered in Europe risking harming Austria, but also to expand, as history reminds us.	fr
This is not enough to make proposals from approximate data.What we need is an absolutely binding objective on the legal level for OSPAR.It is only thus that we will succeed in legal clarity and especially the possibility of acting in court.Everything else would have no effect and would not help prevent ecological disasters like the one we currently know in Romania and Hungary can also occur here.I find it unfortunate that national governments are not willing to commit to a legally binding protection, although they agreed on OSPAR at the international level.But I believe that this is precisely what we must repair here, in Parliament, in order to show that we do not tolerate that it is infringed with the credibility of our policy.It is also important to strengthen the principle of the polluter paying, because prices must tell the ecological truth.We cannot kneel before the interests of lobbies of the agricultural and chemical industry;Rather, we must proclaim and express by our vote that we want the principle of the Pollueur Payer and, in doing so, prices that cover costs.Water is our most important vital resource and we must watch, with our vote, to encourage and push for the real respect of the OSPAR Convention.It is possible with closed production cycles;Everything else would be an edulcoration of the directive.Let us enter this chance!Mr. President, during the short time I have, I want to salute the report and recall three principles, to which we must add everything else, which are clearly exposed in the amendments of the rapporteur: water is not a merchant good but a heritage belonging to the peoples of the Union;The final objective is to manage to eliminate all pollutants from surface water and groundwater;And it is necessary to inform the population so that they can participate in the recovery of water and that it does not consume it excess when it is such a precious good.I know that this directive can encounter problems because we have discussed here the different realities of the different countries of the Union.What is happening to the north is different from what's going on in the south and what's going on in countries with desertification problems.I know it.But some amendments are trying to help the countries of the South, more precisely amendment 43 which, when it speaks of recovery of costs, also indicates that the Member States will have to take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when making decisions.There are also difficulties in the field of transfers.In my country - I live in the north of Spain - there is a big difference between the North and the South, and these difficulties arise when it is necessary to transfer the water from one place to another.But Ms. Lienemann's report also says that receiving water pools must save and watch over their water.	fr
It is our responsibility to participate in the preparation of the guidelines as well as in the evaluation of results. This is because we are representatives of citizens in citizens in Europe, and not only citizens in Europe and regions in Europe. It should be noted that funds are a necessity, but they are not only enough for the emergence of economic and social cohesion. If we take the only indicator per resident of GDP, we may be mistaken. Some colleagues have already talked about unemployment and the decline in population. Some indicators must be studied to see what the state and direction of the rural population is, as the situation of the rural population is worse than the situation of others. Some of the reports presented today in Parliament's plenary session show that the 25 times the most prosperous in the Union in the Union has unemployment in the poorest region. This obliges the European Parliament, the roads, the Member of the Commission, and the entire Commission to act decisively and strategically correctly. I agree that the European Parliament has not had an opportunity or has not been given one because the election period was over to discuss the instructions. However, I do not think that the report would be dealt with too late. We need joint consideration to ensure that new programs and regional development plans that have been prepared before the instructions are introduced can be reviewed and their true value can be determined. Coordination of programs for different goals is essential. We will all unanimously ask for Parliament to be an equal partner when assessing the instructions as these programs progress midway, as we are citizens' representatives. Citizens cannot accept that decisions in the European Union will at least seem bureaucratic. It is necessary for the political dimension to be aware of the responsibility of each and that citizens are informed. This is what we ask for a member of the Commission today. I want to think that he agrees, based on his previous regional leader experience, that he has to set up indicators and strategies that promote economic and social cohesion, not just productivity. Mr President, I support the main proposals in the report on the management of the Structural Funds and the Cohesion Fund during the programming period 2000-2006, as well as the main recommendations of the report, one of which according to the EU structural and cohesion funds must always be considered through an integrated approach. This means that the partnership between local authorities and national governments must be versatile in terms of the use of these subsidies. Member States are required to give more weight to the integrated strategies to revitalize the relationship between urban and rural areas. This last aspect is particularly important. Urban renovation is very important, but in our policies, we also need to find a balance between promoting rural development and improving the living conditions in the city. After all, we do not want to build only cities in Europe. In the remote areas, the Structural Funds have played a key role in the development of both urban and rural areas, mainly, so that the funds have improved roads, water management and related transport networks. This direction continues in accordance with the guidelines for funding, which EU leaders approved by last year at the Berlin Summit and who supported Parliament in the plenary session last May. EU key programs for 1989-1993 and 1994-1999 have undoubtedly helped improve the economic competitiveness of the remote regions of Europe and the target 1. The strengthening of the development that has been achieved so far is the most important thing right now. This would ensure that remote states and the most outrageous regions, the poorest regions of Europe, are successfully able to operate in the new Euro currency area, as well as in the ever-expanding internal market, which have free movement of goods, individuals, services and capital. Finally, I would say that we should keep in mind that the European Social Fund has played a very important role in helping our society's worse livelihoods, even though key infrastructure projects have been supported from the European Regional Development Fund and the KoheaSiorara.	fi
This issue should be included in diplomatic relations and put on the table in the expansion negotiations with the candidate countries. EU Member States must ratify the statute of the International Criminal Court as soon as possible so that it can begin its work. The EU can play an important role in calling for countries to ratify the various international human rights protection conventions. Let me conclude by saying that the reports that will be discussed after my own shows that human rights are violated within the EU. Of course, we have to address this issue. To be credible within the EU, we must also have a good foreign policy. Mr President, this report is a continuation of the earlier excellent work done by the European Parliament in other European institutions. Its starting point is in 1997, the European Year of Racism, but its framework has expanded significantly. I warmly welcome the struggle against racial discrimination steadily within the human rights framework, through its integration into this joint debate, because this approach was followed by this report. The first issue is that last year we proved two things legally and in practice. The first is the legal jurisdiction of the European Union for the fight against racism. The second is the fact that racial discrimination violates a fundamental right and the legislation of the European Union. This is reflected in the assurance during the accession process, but also in the Commission's announcement on the basis of which Mr Belder wrote - and I congratulate him on this - that respect for racial equality and minorities' rights falls within the Copenhagen criteria. You will allow me to say, incidentally, that the amendments by the European Party of Liberal Democrats and Reformers in Mr Belder's report rather than conflict with his report, and are deposited because unfortunately the opinion of the Citizens' Rights Committee was not approved by the Committee. The second issue emphasized in my report is the acceptance of diversity as a source of social vitality, economic prosperity and international influence. European identity is not a homogeneous white culture. It can and should be expanded to include the experiences and culture of minority communities. In a third reason, my report emphasizes that racial prejudices and discrimination poison our entire society, hurting white. Research shows that racism is rising, as is racist violence and the support of extremist parties. On the other hand, progress is made, however difficult it is, and some regions or cities of Europe are increasingly reconciled with the multiracial and multicultural lifestyle. I could characterize London, which I represent, as the multicultural capital of Europe. Of course I believe that we need to discuss in detail about racism, diversity and identity and not treat them as secondary issues or discuss cryptographic. Some consider the language I use in my exposure raw and I really wanted to be clear and clear. This report emphasizes a right -based approach and in particular welcomes the prospect of a European law against discrimination under Article 13, and other legal measures, such as enhanced rights for third -country nationals.	el
"President, everyone underlined it: Today is a very important day, the day of the first debate in the political life of Europe.And that's no coincidence.Today it is not about the relationship of Europe, our institutions to Austria or the party of Mr. Haider.I think today is about Europe itself, about its right to exist, the reasons why we are here in this parliament today.This parliament does not stand for money and goods.This parliament and the European institutions stand for values, morality and for a spirit.Now in the twentieth century we have had the experience that democracies can endanger this morality, these values ​​and this spirit with the names of fanatic nationalism, populism and racism.You only need to read Mr. Haider's program, the FPÖ.In every chapter you come across fanatical nationalism, populism and racism.I only quote a sentence that my friend Vidal-Quadra has already referred to: ""The concept of home is defined in spatial, ethnic and cultural terms, with regard to space, culture and breed."" And we cannot accept such explanations.If Europe should make sense and - forgive me if I tell my political friends - if Christian democracy makes sense, if the history of Christian democracy makes sense, then it must clearly and unmistakably differentiate itself from the statements of this program and refuse how many good reasons may also speak for an agreement with an organization of this kind.That is why I believe that the European Parliament, which is more independent in relation to its statements and actions, than the council or the Commission, the states and European institutions that had the courage to say no;To say what you, Ms. President, have explained in our name;An explanation that honors us and clearly and without wague expresses that we reject and condemn what is going on in Austria.We should remember what a great French Christian Democrat said on the day of the Munich Agreement: ""When it comes to saying no - preferably immediately."" (Applause) Mrs. President!We are worried.We, these are the Belgian Christian Democrats and fortunately also many other colleagues.The coalition, which is prepared in one of the Member States, is certainly an Austrian matter, but it also undeniably has a European dimension.Because what connects us in Europe are the values ​​and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights in the first place.The chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria, Jörg Haider, has repeatedly expressed his disregard for these values.He also disregards the elementary forms of diplomatic courtesy.He is a dangerous man.The Christian Democratic parties in my country have decided for a long time and they remain: they take note of the protests of voters from extreme right, but never negotiate with leaders from extremely right.Values ​​must be higher than power."	de
Mr. President, it is true that the suspension or postponement sine die of conversations between Syrians and Israelis as well as the new bomb attack of the day before yesterday which caused 16 injured is not good news.It is clear that for once, the United States has failed to unlock the situation for these negotiations to resume.It is true that the obstacles are size: the Syrians aspire to have under their sovereignty and their jurisdiction again the platforms of the Golan and to recover the borders prior to June 4, 1967, while the Israelis wish, believing that this is better suitable for their situation, that the boundaries chosen are those fixed in 1923. The blocking of these conversations between Syrians and Israelis does not constitute the only delay thatknows the peace process in the Middle East.The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authority and Israel is currently suspended.Following the conversations that took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the head of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a postponement of two months from February 13, the deadline for the execution of the framework agreement relating to the situation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.What can the European Union do in the face of this situation?Unfortunately not much.It must logically support these negotiations, under the auspices of the United States and must multiply contacts.The presence of the envoy of the European Union, the ambassador Moratinos, who certainly fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency in accordance with the powers available to the European Union, is positive.But all of this does not prevent us from seeing that we are relatively helpless, because when the two-part-parts negotiators take the plane this weekend to return to the United States, we cannot prevent ourselves from thinking that each time a hundred dollars are spent for the peace process in the region, 60 dollars are paid by the European Union.And when one thinks that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, the pathetic character of the presence of the European Union in this process is highlighted.I would like to emphasize the Portuguese presidency on the need we can play a more central role and that it is time to take over and assume an increased presence of the European Union.I hope that the next visit of the president of the European Parliament in the region as well as that of the presidents of the corresponding inter -parliamentary delegations, will mark the beginning of a period when the European Union will take more initiative and will be more present in this difficult and complex peace process.Mr. President, Mr. Chairman of the Council, Mr. Commissioner Patten, I would like to thank you for your interventions, in particular Mr. Patten, whose analysis I entirely share.That's why I don't have the intention of repeating what he said.I would simply like to make three remarks that Commissioner Patten will no doubt consider as similar to what he said, but who, for various reasons, can only be formulated so open than by a parliamentarian.	fr
"Question No. K. 3 (H-727/00): Subject: NATO referral to Court of Criminal Courts of Human Rights, such as the US Human Rights Observatory, have already gathered important data against NATO for crimes associated with bombings in Kosovo and Kosovo. On the basis of these figures, some of which have already been filed with the above Court is accused of ""serious violations of international humanitarian law"" and ""aimed at homicides"". Does the Council consider that such complaints should be put to the judgment of the Criminal Crimes Court of Justice in order to undergo a thorough judicial investigation? If the judicial investigation of complaints against NATO begins, what is going to do with the Secretary -General/High Representative of the KEPPA, who had been a critical period of NATO in the critical period? Is there a process of suspending its status until the judicial examination of complaints is completed? Mr President, the question asked by Mr. Alexander Alavanos is the trigger for a more general reflection. The Council has already repeatedly expressed his belief that, with the aim of dealing with extremist and irresponsible acts, which have clear violations of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, the appeal to strict NATO measures was necessary and justified. I realize that there may be different interpretations of NATO's action and the legality of this action. Everyone is free to support these positions. And in my own country, the various parliamentary factions expressed differentiated positions. Things were done in the way they were done. In any case, the Council adopted a clear position, considering that the airlines launched by the North Atlantic Agreement in the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia looked at the end of the humanitarian disaster caused by Kosovo. At the official level, the above objective was fully formulated in the position approved on April 8 by the General Affairs Council held in Luxembourg. It should be said that these specific NATO measures were not slightly decided on the heart, and were applied only as a ultimate solution when it became apparent that the chances of finding a solution after negotiations had now been eliminated and when the Belgrade authorities began gathering their troops. The Chief MP will obviously consider the fact that Ms. General Prosecutor Del Ponte, during her recent visit to NATO staff, stressed that the International Court of Justice is obliged to examine all complaints lodged, including those who are turning against NATO. This compulsory examination would be carried out if and if the specific complaints were lodged. In any case, I have in my hands a statement by the Attorney General, where he points out that at the present time NATO is not subject to any investigation by the Office of the Prosecutor of the International Criminal Court set up for the former Yugoslavia, and that he is not in the process of being on his own. All information transmitted for the last six months, either by individuals or by groups calling for investigations into NATO's activities during the war in Kosovo was recorded by the prosecutor."	el
We also have to continue our support for economic reforms and social development in the entire Lebanon.A solution must be found for the problem of the Palestinian refugees;With almost five million people, this is the largest refugee group worldwide, and this shows what enormous challenges will be managed in the future.We have to support the initiatives through which the availability of the region's extremely scarce water resources increases and their distribution and management are improved.As the last, perhaps most important area, we promote closer regional cooperation in different areas and have to try to bring all affected countries to a table so that they are combined with combined forces to solve the common problems.It is already clear that the community of the community currently available for the support of this region will not be sufficient in order to cover the enormous needs that will occur after a permanent end of peace.I would like to emphasize this.I would like to point out the advice, and if necessary the parliament, that we are not allowed to promise more than we can ultimately hold.I repeat that a change in Middle East policy will require a fundamentally new course with regard to the support requested by us and expected support.I hope I can assume that we want to provide this support.As Mr. Gama said at the beginning, progress has been made in recent months and weeks.Nevertheless, this difficult process will inevitably be accompanied by problems and disappointments.We will do everything so that this process can be successfully completed and we can meet the tasks and challenges that will be associated with this agreement.Finally, for those who have only come to the plenum in the last few minutes, I would like to repeat what I have already pointed out at the beginning: Unfortunately, I cannot remain until the end of the pronunciation, because this debate was originally supposed to take place in the morning and I have therefore made an appointment for a conversation about the situation in the Balkans for the evening.I hope the members of the house understand.President!Commissioner Patten can count on our understanding.I would like to tell him that the connections to Madrid have normally improved and that is why I hope to see him there soon.The explanations that we heard during the day for peace process in the Middle East come because of the crowded journey that Minister Gama - I also regretted his absence from this pronunciation - accompanied by further council representatives in the area.The tenor of the news in the media about the latest events in the area could arrange for us to a pessimistic view of the situation.I am honestly of the opinion that such an assessment would not do justice to the facts.In this regard, I share the positive perspectives of Commissioner Patten.With this I want to say the following: It is true that the Israeli government has postponed the third handover of the territory of the West Bank to the Palestinian authorities.But it is also true that since the signing of the Sharm El -Heikh agreement, 39 % of the territory of the West Bank and two thirds of the Gaza strip have been handed over to the Palestinian self -government, and - what is most important - this agreement has been met with the most important thing, especially since even its postponement is a privilege provided for in Sharm El -Heikh.	de
The point is to offer work in areas where unemployment is high. It is dangerous to expect that the unemployed will move to areas where there is work, and especially when this labor migration means moving to another Member State. As a result, the further desolation of certain developmental areas could occur. Mr President, we did not facilitate the situation, Mr President, I would like to thank Prime Minister Guterres for his speech, as well as for the clarity of his speech. The big question that concerns me about this is what new really exists? Currently, we of course have a macroeconomic cooperation, the so -called Cologne process, we have a process of employment, the Luxembourg process; what is the new summit in this area really offering? What is new is of course the issue of social security. This issue has been slightly discussed at the top level. I believe it is also a very important issue that should be discussed. I think it is simple in this area to draw conclusions from the Luxembourg process and to declare which of them can be applied to social protection. I wonder why public health will not be discussed. It is an important part of social protection that is going through a crisis and the council is not going to discuss it, despite the fact that they spend a lot of money and it is very important for much of citizens. What Mr Barsn said to me concerns that the program proposed, Mr President, is in fact a social democratic program. When I re -elaborate your speech, indeed, I think there is a point that seems particularly social -democratic to me. This is the point where the macroeconomy should be directed in such a way as to lead to employment. Of course this is the case, because if a proper macroeconomic policy is followed then it leads to improving employment as a consequence. We have found this. But on the other hand, one should not misuse the good rules of macroeconomics by specializing them too much. Because in this case we will reach a situation they have known and still know a series of economies guided by socio-economic and socio-democratic rules and in which employment was mainly the victim of the wrong macroeconomic policy. This should not happen. I hope that the prime minister does not propose the abolition or significant conversion of a macroeconomic policy, which in the past years has led to great success in this area, so that it is not effective. Finally, Mr President, I have a problem with the arguments used by the Portuguese Presidency and partly, though to a lesser extent, with those used by the Commission. That is, it is the defensive character. We have a series of countries in Europe, including Denmark, the Netherlands and Ireland, which have a good performance in the field of employment with that of the United States. Therefore, it is possible for Europeans to do so.	el
The level of development aid is, of course, important and all rich countries have to raise it. This must be done in particular to combat poverty and through the development of capacity. However, the level of development aid is only one of the many tools that can strongly influence the development of poor countries. Today, many colleagues have referred to, in addition to development aid, other important issues where opposites and contradictions between different political sectors are very serious. It is about trade policy, agricultural policy and fishing policy. Of course, other important issues are private investments, collaboration in research and technology, and how the world community deals and finance different universal problems for us all. These problems include climate issues, biological diversity, health issues and so on. Globalization, in other words, a new economic economy, further emphasizes the importance of this statement. In this economy, the links between different political sectors are more intense. In my opinion, we are discussing today about how the EU could participate in a debate on the possibilities and dangers of global growth, as well as the necessary rules of the game that poor states need to succeed. Of course, the study or mapping required by Maij-Weggen from common areas of different politics and what the contradictions look like is very central. I have to ask myself why the Commission has not done more work for this. The Commission is new, it must be given time, but the lack of such mapping shows that there are strong tensions in the Commission. I can only hope that Commission member Nielson will achieve success in the Commission in the future discussions. In addition to this type of study, I would like to see a more positive analysis that should be able to be done continuously. This analysis should not only look at development aid, but should comprehensively look at all different forms of support and income transfers that affect poor states. These are technology, trade -related issues, cooperation in the field of research, and so on. It would be a very constructive contribution to the discussion we had. Finally, in paragraph 6 of the resolution, Parliament recommends the establishment of a working group to achieve consistency. I think it's just a coincidence, but of course, a member of the Commission of the Environment must be part of this team. Let us hope that the discussion we have is in the water divider. Until now, politics has been labeled too much that one hand is given and the other is taken. Many will be very interested in monitoring the development in the future. Mr President, Seattle's protesters claimed that there was less harm in free trade and the least developed countries, it is just the selfish benefit of the rich country. What if we, however, looked at the economic growth rate of India and Tanzania, for example, and the pace of poverty over the 40 or 50 years in which they have been independent. There was a theory that protectionism and state guidance could maintain jobs and enable industry gradient and painless adaptation. It failed;Poverty worsened even further. The medicine may not taste very good in the short term, but allowing free competition in both domestic and foreign markets forces you to make the most of resources and pre-long lead to higher standard of living and better quality of life. Hasn't the European Union itself proved and have the unified market in particular prove this? As Nielson said, this is a great example of countries and areas seeking greater wealth. However, preaching for the benefits of free trade in developing countries is not enough. We also have to live ourselves as we preach and offer free access to our own markets. In the Parliament's resolution, the WTO negotiations spoke in favor of the EU's free import policy. By removing all the rest of the import restrictions, customs and quotas and what is equally important, all other obstacles, such as those who mentioned by Maij -Weggen, were better secured by removing such obstacles than any developmental emission of developing countries, which we and they want.	fi
However, I must add that the cooperation of our working groups with similar groups in third countries has gone too far in the eyes of the Member States.We have therefore come to a modification in committee.The commission will nevertheless take into account the expectations of the Parliament once again in the reworked version and submit the guidelines thus modified.She will thus continue to fight so that this objective becomes acceptable in the eyes of the Member States.A final information about the 13 amendments deposited.Of these 13 amendments, only three cannot be accepted by the Commission, namely amendments 3, 12 and 13. All the others can be accepted, either completely either in their minds.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is an extraordinary coincidence to discuss during this period of the Equal initiative within the European Parliament.In recent times and because of political developments in Austria, there has been an increasing political concern in Europe, but also political statements and dialogue.It should be noted that concrete policies must be presented both in Parliament and to the Commission.Concrete proposals both for legislation and action plans which concern the fight against discrimination, and which concern the establishment of freedoms and social rights.Thus, allow me to make a small allusion to the train of measures against discrimination, praying to the commissions responsible for the Parliament to appoint rapporteurs, in order to approach the train of measures against discrimination as quickly as possible.I now come to the Equal initiative which is of course based on article 13. The Equal initiative concerns all forms of discrimination on the basis of article 13, that is to say the fight against discrimination based on sex, race, age, disability.In particular, I would like to congratulate Ms. Stenzel because her attempts in order to conclude the agreement on the Equal initiative are particularly difficult and complex, not only because the commissions involved defended totally different points of view but also because it was an extremely delicate political subject.The first observation, which was also formulated by many other colleagues, refers to the question of whether it takes a separate mention for women.Admittedly, we have expressed our disagreement as to an aspect of article 13, but the treaty at this moment is such that it is, and among the discrimination categories we find discrimination on the basis of sex.Thus, in accordance with the treaty as it presents itself today, the Equal initiative is structured in this way.However, I want to recall that there is a special axis for the employment strategy that concerns women and that a special program is preparing, the fifth program for equality between men and women.I divided into four groups the subjects that attracted the attention of colleagues.First, the enlargement of thematic domains.There are four thematic areas, like employment strategy, employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree on the enlargement of these thematic fields in accordance with the proposals that have been submitted by the European Parliament.As for concern in relation to the possible danger of attributing to a single country all the funds for one of the categories undergoing discrimination, I would say that it is stipulated in the initiative, with the greatest possible clarity that the Member States will have to submit a thematic domain for all categories undergoing discrimination.	fr
Again, what I have said very often: Yes, I wish to draw a positive directory by the committee. There will certainly be many contradictions during this discussion in the body, but we need at least one plan for a positive list of additives in animal nutrition. Equally important is to have strict specifications for hygiene during the production of additional materials and to carry out regular controls in the Member States. In both areas there are shortages, and at this point we still have a lot to do. Mr President, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on his report. This is an issue that we will undoubtedly review in many cases in the future. What happened in recent years has turned our attention to the frightening problems that not only food producers face but also consumers. A balance must be achieved. We need to resolve this issue because it is important for consumers regain the confidence in the food they eat. One way to achieve this goal is complete transparency in terms of food marking. Genetically modified organisms (GMOs) are the new challenge we face. It is something that people are very concerned about, and quite justified: and I myself share these concerns. But I think we should not allow our concerns about GMOs to overshadow our concerns about growth factors used in feed or antibiotics used in complex feed. Indeed, we should not allow the GMM to overshadow the fact that osteocup is still included in feed in many European countries. One of the factors behind these developments and mentioned in the present debate is the competition - competition between Member States on the cost of food production. All of these are areas where we need to ensure that everyone is playing on equal terms: standards must be the same for food supplies in all Member States. We had the panic of dioxin, BSE and many other problems. The main problem is financial, and in particular who is the cost. The problem is that the costs do not share equally between the consumer and the producer: the producer has been forced to have the total cost. We need the equal division of the additional costs that has emerged. We must also ensure that food supplies imported into the European Union keep standards within the European Union. If we do not maintain these standards for food foods, then we will encounter greater difficulties in the future.(In) I would first like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and its rapporteur, Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, who is chaired by the Parliamentary Committee for examining the proposal of the European Commission. The committee's proposal is, as some of you said, rather technical. However, its purpose is relatively simple: to harmonize the procedures that govern the approval of additives in the animal nutrition. At present, approvals are subject to different treatment, depending on whether the applications had been submitted before or after January 1, 1988.	el
In this question we need much more openness and transparency than before.It cannot be concerned that a measure like this is imposed on the Member States without proper public debate.President, values, colleagues!In the name of the radical MPs, I found myself in the Committee on Budget Control in the vote on the present report of the voice because I share the concerns that are undoubtedly important by the representative of another, namely the Common Law.We undoubtedly exercise pressure with this report, as we believe that certain aspects require a solution and fraud in the community must be combated and contained.However, it cannot be accepted without criticism of how under the impetuous urge and with the dogged determination of committee chairman Theato our committee would like to conclude this report.Another important criticism of the report concerns the derived right.According to Article 280 of the contract, the Council can decide to combat fraud.However, we are a little dismayed that a facility that would mean a qualitative leap is recommended without immediately for predicting the resulting consequences, i.h.that the aspect of defense and thus the possibility of effective functioning of charges and defense are neglected in such an important legal system.This dismay should be expressed with my abstention in the committee.President!In my opinion, this topic in the European Parliament, both in the plenary and in the committees, must be thought out loud, even if, of course, not without taking into account the legal culture and the circles in which the institutional issues are dealt with.It is about very serious incidents that seemed common in the past.In the meantime, certain changes have occurred, at least among the mechanisms, especially when it comes to control.However, we are not yet satisfied, especially not if the responsible committees even spoke of a European law enforcement agency for crimes committed at European level, fraud, embezzlement and disclosure of official secrets.Undoubtedly, we should protect the interests of the community and their reputation as well as the relationship with the taxpayers who form an essential and essential component of community life.For this reason, it is right to raise the problem of a general and universal interest protection, which is better coordinated with the national judiciary.The most difficult problem arises here: What position does a European law enforcement agency take in relationships with the individual national communities and their respective judicial systems?In my opinion, this topic must be treated both from cultural and practical aspects.Today there is a risk of overlapping the multitude of different institutions existing in the individual countries.Mr President, I would like to say something quickly to two points.First: I do not want to refer to the philosophical questions of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of the Member States, although I am very important to make such a debate, because my regular look at British television stations reveals me what is conjured up by national politicians in threat to domestic legal culture.Sometimes this is already tiring and deserves a discussion.But that's not my point.	de
"In any case, weak businesses are further weakened by the AIDS virus.Resources that have already been overused are still being stressed.In the countries with the highest AIDS rates, 50 % and more of all hospital beds are currently occupied by AIDS patients.To a completely different thing.I would like to support Kuba's membership as a AKP country as part of the new Lomé Agreement, which will soon be agreed between the European Union and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.I know that this is controversial in a way, especially because of the government's attitude towards the Castro regime.On this occasion, however, the European Union will demand the inclusion of political criteria in the Lomé Agreement.Criteria of good practice of state behavior, which extends refugee issues, corruption, human rights and democracy, will be part of the final agreement between the European Union and all signatory states of the Lomé Agreement from Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific region.The Lomé Agreement, on which the entire structure of the relationship between the European Union and the 71 states in Africa, in the Caribbean area and in the Pacific Ocean, is still the most efficient and demanding development instrument in the context of the north-south relationships. After years of ""good and loyal service"", the most important symbol of the efforts of the European Union about improving the lot remainsThe poorest countries and the promotion of their development.This shows the human face of Europe ... In John Corrie's report, the importance of this unique, targeted instrument and the work of the parity assembly that uses this instrument are very important.This is all the more true when the precarious structure of this ambitious structure was endangered.Negotiations on the path of the partnership between the European Union and the AKP countries to the new millennium were a very difficult trial.I welcome today that reason and generosity have triumphed about the difficulties and that new perspectives open up for this partnership.Over thirty years after the introduction of the north-south partnership unique in their kind, the adaptation of an instrument that has proven itself, but is getting on in years, is an indispensable need to be able to counter new challenges.Therefore, the new agreement, which will be closed on May 31 of this year on the Fiji Islands for a term of 20 years, represents more than just the extension of the agreements that regulate relationships between Europe and the AKP countries.This means that your redesign must be sealed.The new agreement clearly sanctions the political dimension of a partnership that forms the only forum for dialogue and political exchange as part of the north-south relationships.Since the parity assembly continues to open the elected representatives from the parliaments of the AKP countries, this dimension not only has to be maintained, but rather encouraged.The parity assembly thus represents a platform for the defense of the common interests of the European countries and the developing countries. According to the fiasco of the conference in Seattle, our task is now to coordinate our attitude with regard to the further development of the rules for world trade, which are to be used to combat poverty.The partnership can now be created in the long term.The way for your modernization is free:"	de
"Madam President, because I hear some laughs on the part of the Socialists, it is good to know that I was mentioned that there are wide circles in the European Socialist Party group that would very much like to withdraw from the agenda of this issue, because it had not been voted on by the Daily Station. European Socialists. I do not know if this information is right, but we as a team of the European People's Party and the European Democrats will certainly be grateful if this issue was withdrawn, because parliament has already dealt with this issue many times. There are even decisions against the imposition of a similar tax. For this reason, my team is asking me to withdraw this issue from the agenda. Thank you, Mr. Poettering. We will now hear Mr Wurtz, who is opposed to this application. Madam President, I would first like to emphasize Mr Poettering's lack of logic. At the moment, he just had a moral lesson in the group of the European Socialist Party, because he rejected a decision that was made in a very clear way at the Conference of Presidents. However, he too does the same thing. We discussed and were unanimous in addition to the team of the European People's Party and the Liberal Group, and I had even pointed out, you would remember it, dear colleagues, team presidents, that the question is not whether you are in favor or against the Tobin tax, but if you are daring to hear it. We don't ask for much. Consequently, I reiterate the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and the Council, to learn once the position of these two principles in relation to the proposal, which is relatively moderate, but which would send, however, an important message to its public opinion, especially after its disorder. We will vote on the request of the team of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats for the withdrawal from the agenda of the oral question on tax on capital.(The House rejects the application with 164 votes in favor, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions) Madam President, I would like to thank Mr Poettering for the publicity he has just given in this debate. Thanks. Madam President, was my vote, which I could not give by electronic media because I don't have the card? My vote was ""in favor""?. Dear colleagues, once again, should everyone really have their card on Monday. We see that we have a problem here. Under these circumstances I have to make a decision. And I have also forgotten my card and will vote against the proposal. I therefore believe that the oral question remains on the agenda.(Applause) is the last time we take into account those who have forgotten their cards. Be absolutely clear and tell others.(Applause) Yes, the oral question remains on the agenda and yes, the president has the right to vote, as well as the right to forget about her card."	el
I can also agree to the part of change application 6, which suggests a change in Directive 93/53 due to scientific and technical knowledge.As I said, the ISA is not a danger to health according to the scientific knowledge.As far as the environmental impact is concerned, many should be known that a number of causes of the decline in stocks are held responsible in the course of the past decades, including pollution, overfishing, climatic changes, etc.It cannot currently be ruled out that ISA also affects wild salmon stocks.Fish have already escaped from the aquaculture systems and the virus was found in wild salmon.In this context, there are a number of open questions that can only be clarified by further scientific studies.This is also the reason why there is great caution when combating the ISA.Infested fish must not remain in the farms, and I am ready to further check this matter so that the virus is prevented from reaching the environment.For this purpose, I suggest that we change our original proposal in such a way that the Commission's approval must be obtained for the rural programs developed by the responsible authorities.This is intended to avoid excessively lengthy fishing distance periods.I also suggest that fish that have clinical signs of the disease are immediately removed.With the help of the procedures already existing in Community Law, distance programs are set up that are based on the state of health of the fish in order to maintain effects on the environment as low as possible.Based on this, I can accept change applications 7 and 8 if a slight change of No. 8.I also have great understanding for amendment, but I think that it can be put better and thus a connection between environmental issues and the strategies for fighting illness and extermination can be established.I see myself unable to advocate amendments 12 and 13.I have the feeling that this should exclude any risk.I believe that it should be very difficult to achieve this without the affected fish breeding sector being closed.I am looking forward to the views of the parliament on these amendments, and if you think that this approach is the best solution, I will attentively take note of this.I can partially accept amendment 11.In conclusion, I would like to underline that we continue to strive for a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations from the contract.I consider measures that are appropriate to this goal to the right way.We continue to work for the extermination of the disease.This is a goal from which both the environment and the salmon breeding sector will benefit.I hope that the European Parliament recognizes our commitment by promoting our proposal.I would be very grateful for that.Thank you very much, Mr. Byrne.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.Protection of young marine animals according to the agenda follows the report (A5-0035/2000) by Mr. Gallagher on behalf of the Committee for Fisheries on the proposal for a prescription of the Council on the fourth change in regulation (EC) No. 1626/94 on technical measures to maintain fish stocks in the Mediterranean and the fourth amendment of the regulation (EC) No. 850/98 to maintain the fishing resources by technical measuresProtection of young marine animals (KOM (1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222 (CNS)).	de
"It is clear that many who, in Wales, see the program of structural funds as a means to stop some of the great difficulties that we are undoubtedly confronted.We have found that poverty is growing in Wales, a trend that has been strengthening since 1997. We have seen the gap between the rich and the poor widening.We are therefore expecting the structural fund program that it is not limited to considering industrial restructuring, we want it to also bring more improvements to the entire economic base of Wales.What brings us great prejudice to us, however, is to believe that, in a way, the granting of structural funds was a victory for the government, when it only recognizes that Wales is faced with very great difficulties.This is why I would like to highlight certain points that the commission should, in my opinion, place in the foreground.We hope that the Commission will deal with points related to additionality.We deplore that, in a way, the British figures have masked the Welsh figures.We also hope that the Commission will provide appropriate funding projects.We hope that it will guarantee, by going against the British government, the participation of the private sector in the planning phase, as it is sure that this must provide the main momentum to the expenses of the structural funds.Finally, we ask the commissions to ensure that the structural funds are spent transparently.Within this parliament, transparency is too often lacking.In this area, the Commission can become the great friend of Wales.Mr. President, our committee deals with these questions in many different angles, and to start I will talk about the angle of research.We consider it very positive that, in its conclusions, the rapporteur has taken into account our proposal according to which research infrastructure should be extended in cohesion countries by implanting professional schools and universities so that they serve the populations of the least developed regions better and that they allow trained people to remain in their region of origin.It is something that it is possible to perform by taking measures at the level of the public authorities.Such decentralization of higher education is undoubtedly a useful policy when it is a question of guaranteeing development.The second point on which we wanted to attract attention, precisely with the view of industrial policy, it is that we would have wanted by reflecting on the coordination of structural funds and the cohesion fund, the Commission attaches greater attention to the impact of the progression of services, electronic commerce and the use of the Internet.In the past, poverty and wealth were more dependent on the structures of economic life.The rich regions were those where there were industrial jobs, while today these regions can very well have become a burden and be poor.It therefore becomes necessary to also carry out investments in the new sectors of activity, so -called ""electronic"" production and the production of electronic services, because they are sectors of the future."	fr
The best prevention for the future is the certainty that the charters will have to be heavily, civilly, criminally and financially condemned if they are not extremely vigilant about the safety of the ships they choose.Second, the condition of a double shell for oil tankers admitted to frequent community waters must be imposed as quickly as possible and not given to Greek calendars.Third, a strict limitation of the age of ships admitted to frequent community waters must be quickly fixed.It could be a maximum of fifteen years.Without obtaining a sufficiently clear, strict and rigorous community regulatory framework, the Member States which, for their part, wish to establish one should be allowed to do so to protect its population and their territory, in the same way that the United States has managed to learn from the disaster of the Exxon Valdez by demanding the double hull and banish from their waters all ships of more than twenty years.This is how the United States had refused Erika access to its waters.If the community had done the same, a huge disaster would have been avoided.Let us make sure, Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, to learn this time really the lesson, even when media emotion and parliamentary emotion will be used.Mr. President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic BRAVERY, HAVEN, AMOCO CADIZ, GINO, Tanio, there are all names of disaster memory.And now Erika.Who is the turn?Twenty-one year after the Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth of the dark, the seventh since 1967, proves the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.The West Atlantic is once again paying the high price of their inability to react, of their capitulation in front of the multinationals.It is difficult to understand why French and Europeans authorize what Americans refuse, and why Europe, usually so quick to legislate in terms of environment, has skipped maritime security.The result is there.The Erika, a beating ship Maltese pavilion, amber wreck classified among the most dangerous oil tankers, soiled our ribs over more than 400 km, which represents much more serious pollution than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.Elected from Loire-Atlantique, I unfortunately can testify.These repetitive disasters are not natural, they owe nothing to fatality.They are the consequence of the inconsistency of men.It is indeed an ecological disaster.Only those who have harsh realities on the ground have doubted it.It is also an economic catastrophe for all those who live from the sea and tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, conchyls, malaria, traders, etc.Erika's bug must be the last in the series.We must first shed light on this sinking.Why not appoint a parliamentary commission of inquiry or associate parliamentarians with the mission which was announced earlier by the Commission?Then, we must legislate urgently, first, so that the exact characteristics of the transported goods are known.Indeed, according to experts, Erika oil had to flow by the bottom and never reach the ribs.	fr
You said that the preventive principle should not be used as a hidden obstacle to the trade.Is this aspect interpreted in the same way on both sides of the Atlantic?In my opinion, we will have problems with hormonally treated beef and genetically modified plants.Will the Americans take the same point of view on this question as we do?President!I can be pleased to say that we have just signed a protocol for biological security in Montreal.This makes it possible for us to achieve agreement in an international forum about the definition of the precautionary principle.I consider the signing of this protocol to be a breakthrough on this question.I believe that it will form the basis for future discussions on the preventive principle, because we will be able to use it as an example of the interpretation of this principle.In addition, this protocol is also recognized as an important and valuable instrument.President!I have two questions and will try to take myself very briefly.My first question relates to the application of the precautionary principle.If I understand that correctly, there were some ambiguities.Is it that a risk test including a cost benefit analysis, i.e. a cost-beefit analysis, has to be carried out first?If this corresponded to the facts, it would be very worrying, since it was actually not intended to use a cost-benefit analysis as an instrument when deciding on the application of the precautionary principle.Instead, the precautionary principle should have priority.My second question concerns the burden of proof.I remember Ms. Wallström's idea as the new commissioner in the committee.At that time she spoke of introducing a reverse burden of proof, i.e.h.The manufacturer of a product must demonstrate its safe.I am now interested in whether this also applies in the document now submitted by the Commission.Thank you very much, Ms. Schörling.You have asked two important questions and I am pleased that I will now get the opportunity to comment on it.No, it does not have to be started with a cost-benefit analysis, but the basis should be an assessment of our level of knowledge and the knowledge of science as well as its evaluation compared to the dangers that we see for the environment or human or animal health.However, if a certain measure has been decided, the cost -effective implementation should be chosen.This is intended to prevent measures from being taken that are completely inappropriate in terms of their effectiveness.So you don't have to start with a cost-benefit analysis.The second question concerned the reverse burden of proof.It is completely correct that we have to use them in certain cases.A good example of an area in which this is necessary is the chemical strategy.However, it is about a single subject area, while this notification of the precautionary principle can be described as horizontal, i.h.It affects all political subject areas.For this reason, a reverse burden of proof or its formation is not discussed separately in this context, but instead it is about political decision -making and the foundations for this.However, it is absolutely correct that, for example, we have to come to a reverse burden of proof in the chemicals.Mr President, in my opinion, the precautionary principle would have to be quite radical, otherwise you will always lose yourself in the winding labyrinths of the interpretations.	de
"I finally come to the agreement on South Africa, which also spoke of the rapporteur.I am simply delighted - not to say happy - to be able to announce to you this evening, as a conclusion to this debate of circumstance, that the South African president accepted today the solution proposed unanimously last Monday by the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU about the problems hanging with South Africa.The ""Grouppa war"" is therefore over.Peace has returned and we can now hope for a collaboration with South Africa on the basis of common values ​​and dreams that bring us closer.Here, I think, a good conclusion to this very interesting debate and I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur as well as at the assembly for the collaboration which settled in the context of the relations between the countries of the Third World and our work.Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.Stabilization and association Agreement with ARYM The agenda calls for the report (A5-0031/2000) of Mr. Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, on the recommendation of the Commission relating to a decision of the Council authorizing the Commission to negotiate a stabilization and association agreement with the old Yugoslav Republic of(Sec (1999) 1279 -C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121 (COS)).Mr. President, Commissioner Patten, dear colleagues, it is today a question of a country which has just overcome very difficult times, a country, which is however in the process of raising the slope, its own forces, by its own will and with the support of the international community.If the European Union, the Council and the Commission - I suppose that Parliament will be rallying to this decision tomorrow - propose for the first time in Southeast Europe to conclude a stabilization and association agreement in the Balkan region - I hope to be able to use this term throughout my intervention -, it constitutes in the first place a recognition of the work accomplished by the Arym/Macedonia on the economic level, but alsoSanta to the surroundings and the ethnic minority that inhabits the country.Because having a minority of 33 to 35 % on its own territory is certainly not an easy task with regard to the vicinity of this country.This country and its politicians - undoubtedly different from one region to another - have always carried out remarkable work, it should be recognized.The Commission invites us to conclude an agreement with the Council.I would like to make two or three remarks concerning precisely the areas in which there may remain some differences of view.In this regard, however, I would like to underline the quality of the work carried out by Commissioner Patten and I salute the interest he has in Arym and the whole region.Let's talk about the regional approach first of all.If it is understood correctly, I think this regional approach is important and necessary."	fr
"I also underlined the need for prevention.The participation of the social partners must also be underlined.It takes flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced, this is a priority.Flexibility is also needed for countries with small budgets.Although I think that certain aspects of the report could be better treated in another way, I believe on the whole that this report offers a flexible and supposed approach and that it is necessary to support it.By this Equal Community initiative, the Commission wants to replace community and adaptation community initiatives, as well as various sub -programs in this sector - NOW (new opportunities for women), Horizon (for people with disabilities), Youthstart (Integration of young people on the labor market) and Integra (for endangered groups) - with the aggravating circumstance that the sums planned have been significantlyreduced.Thus, it is through this initiative that the Commission will be implemented as new methods of combating discrimination and inequalities of all kinds in the context of the labor market, based on the four pillars of the directives of employment policy.It is a lot for so few means.But to guarantee possibilities for success to this new methodology, the Commission should have opted for a less complex, simpler and direct proposal, with the participation of NGOs from the start of the process, so that partnerships develop in a balanced way.She didn't do it.We hope that it will want to reconsider at least the points we have mentioned.Mr. President, some will remember a successful film, ""Cocoon"", in which elderly people find a second youth by drinking special water.It is therefore extremely important to pay the greatest attention to the water that we all drink and to follow and approve the provisions relating to it.This is why I voted in favor of this common provision, but I would like to emphasize that I hope that we will especially watch out what the degree of purity of the water is maximum when it enters our homes.I noticed, in the arrangement which was approved, the lack - but I am sure that it will be remedied there - support for those who purify water from them, in their own home.Aside from amendment 76, where I made an error, because my intention was to vote for, my votes could explain itself by the following fiction: supposed project of environmental directive: ""Directive of the European Parliament and the Council, establishing the obligation to maintain during the winter, in the streets, places and gardens of European cities a temperature of at least eighteen degrees.""Main lines of the directive: a) Each city will have to have sufficient energy and technological means for this objective to be reached in 2012;b) The costs will be fully borne by the inhabitants of each city, and will be added to the electricity bill.Opinion of a deputy for northern Europe: ""This directive would be unfair because, for example, the cost for a resident of Stockholm would be more than two hundred times higher than the cost for a resident of Naples."""	fr
Work in connection with the BSE cattle disease is running in the Member States, and the introduction of stab test tests to determine infectiousity in the Member States is being used.I know that Ms. Roth-Behrendt has already asked me this question, and I was currently doing a quick solution, but as far as I know, cross-departmental consultations are currently taking place in the Commission.In any case, work is done.I hope that the next time you ask me this question, I can serve with more detailed information.Ms. Jackson inquires about the 24 new laws and 20 updates and asks whether this does not lead to more over -regulation.With these regulations, we want to close gaps in applicable laws.It is less about setting up new or additional regulatory systems, even though that is part of it, but it is about uncovering and closing and closeing vulnerability and gaps in the chain to the consumer.The accession candidates were mentioned, and of course we thought of that.Food safety and security in many other areas are of crucial importance in connection with the expansion.I made Mr. Verhogen aware of this problem.Mr. Commissioner!The ignorance of some member countries has brought us into a great food crisis in Europe, and, unfortunately, I am annoyed again that today, when they present this interesting report, the Council in entirety is once again missing.I would very much like to know from you how you want to make sure that such a new authority, whatever it may mean in detail, also gets influence on the advice, who is in charge in this authority.Of course, we must not prescribe anything in terms of content, but I already insist that the parliament keeps its right to Maastricht and Amsterdam.I have great concern that we will once again get an authority that flies anonymously through Europe as a satellite;I would love such an authority like the devil the holy water.I hope it will not happen!I also welcome the white book.But will the food authority also have enough authority to prevent appearances such as the beef war and France's refusal to remove the ban?They mentioned that the Commission had the opportunity to withhold subsidies and subsidies similar to France.Could you also imagine that the Commission, for example, would make interim payments similar to those that are currently required by the British farmers?President!Mr. Commissioner!In the last week they said at an information event that they were of the opinion that the future EU food authority should not be located on the periphery, but did not deal in more detail, which means periphery.The work of the EU authority shifted to Dublin has proven that geographical removal is not an obstacle to efficiency and connections.The most important tasks of the future food authority were the recording, publication and coordination of data, the creation of recommendations for the development of food safety and - as they said - the collection of scientific information and their popularization among consumers.All of these things can be realized anywhere in the field of the European Union with modern technology.	de
I would like to answer the two inquiries as follows.When joining the European Union, Sweden was allowed to maintain its quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages that travelers can introduce to the country from other member states.This exemption from the principle of free goods traffic and freedom of movement expires on June 30 of this year.Sweden now wishes to extend this measure by another five years, which is necessary in the interest of ethnicity.My position on this is clear.Since joining the Union, Sweden has had enough time to coordinate his policy on a state without such import restrictions.Therefore, I see no reason to stimulate further extension of this measure.The citizens of Europe have the right to acquire goods for their own use in any Member State, including taxes, and to introduce them to another Member State without these goods being undergoing controls or may have to be taxed again.Deviations from this basic principle of the internal market must remain limited exceptions.We would like to ensure that Sweden's citizens like other citizens of the European Union are now also enjoying the advantages of the internal market.This does not mean that I would not share Sweden's concern about possible health problems that can be caused by alcohol abuse.However, a expertise recently made by Professor Lindgren from the University of Lund proves that the abolition of the restrictions of alcohol consumption in Sweden does not increase.I already had the opportunity twice to present my position to Mr. Ringholm, the Swedish finance minister.Last week I also discussed this matter with the finance committee of the Swedish parliament.Now the government of Sweden is responsible for taking suitable steps.Thank you for this answer, Mr. Commissioner!First of all, I regret that an error has crept into my request to the Commission.There is an end date in 2004, but of course it must be called 1st July 2000.To a certain extent I understand to a certain extent for the commission's point of view that exceptional regulations should only be temporary and the rule is the normal case.Nevertheless, I would like to ask you two questions: Do you still commemorate further discussions with the Swedish government to extend the exemptions, for example as long as such regulations apply to Denmark and Finland?My second question refers to common alcohol policy.You can consider this as a question of the internal market, but also as a question of public health in the entire EU.What role do alcohol politics and aspects of public health play in the work of the Commission?Alcohol policy across Europe is not exclusively about the internal market, but also about public health.If we had considered these aspects in connection, the discussions with Sweden might have been easier to have.I can thank Mr. Andersson for the additional question on his first request and give him the following answer.First, for Finland and Denmark, exceptions from the basic principle of free goods traffic apply until 2003.These countries are currently preparing measures so that they are equipped for imports of alcoholic drinks in 2003.In the case of Sweden, the situation is nevertheless different. In 1995, an exception was decided for a period of five years, which now expires.	de
"You explained previously that we run in disaster and we do nothing.You have to provide a quick procedure!I would like to say above all that I agree with the priorities in the identification of the personal responsibilities invoked by the Honorable MP.As for judicial structuring, we have had the opportunity to hear several times the description made by Mr. Kouchner of the great difficulties which he encounters in the assembly of an administrative machine and a judicial structure.We know that the first steps took place several months ago.We know the difficulties, especially of a financial nature, with which Mr. Kouchner was confronted in the assembly of this administrative machine and in particular the difficulty in recruiting the police forces for public security.It is a responsibility, Mr. MP, who is still present within the framework of the European Union and I would like to tell you that this question was underlined, as for Kosovo, during the ""General Affairs"" council on Monday.There have been declarations and pressures exerted from the various Member States which have undertaken to provide police forces.Some Member States have taken refuge behind the fact that they have armed forces on the ground and that they cannot complete, as quickly as it would be desirable, the police forces they have committed to providing.We are perfectly aware that this circumstance decisively compromises the work of Mr. Kouchner, the regularization and normalization of the administrative structure of Kosovo, especially the judicial part and the police coverage.This leads to harmful, clear and obvious effects, on the ability to regulate the articulation between ethnic groups and we are aware that if measures are not taken in the short term, we could go to the front of tension situations such as those we have known a few hours ago and to the repetition of these situations of tension in other areas of Kosovo.This is a question essentially located in the context of NATO, but about which the European Union has no difficulty associated with the reading of NATO with regard to these questions.You know, Mr. MP, the difficulty that exists at the level of the selection of objectives during a military action, especially when it takes place using aerial means;You also know that a set of objectives are aimed at infrastructure and aim to hinder the functioning of the war machine.We obviously approach land, a gray area, where you will tell me that these are civilian objectives, such as bridges, road or rail infrastructure, while others will say that these are military objectives, because they are used to support military structures in their assault actions, such as those carried out at the time by the forces of Mr. Milosevic inside Kosovo.It is this difference in interpretation of the military objectives that separates us."	fr
This attitude is consistent with the principles we have always swallowed. Thanks, Mr. Segni, I'll do it very happy. Indeed, it is perfectly aligned with the positions that our parliament has always adopted. Madam President, I would like to draw your attention in a case in which this parliament has repeatedly dealt with. I mean the case of Alexander Nikitin. We are all pleased here that the court acquitted him, making it clear that access to environmental information is a constitutional right to Russia as well. But now we learn that Alexander Nikitin is going to be charged again, after the prosecution appeals. We know, and we have found it in many, in fact, resolutions - especially during the last year of the previous year - that this is not only a legal affair but that it is also a mistake to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal activity and betrayal, because we benefit from his affection. These findings constitute the basis of European Band Programs for the Protection of the Band, and therefore please study a letter plan that will describe the most important events and make this position in Russia in the spirit of Parliament's decisions, of course, Mrs. Schroedter. Madam President, I would first like to congratulate you on keeping your word, because I actually find out in this first period of the new year that the number of television stations we catch on the body has increased dramatically. But Madam President, it didn't happen what I asked for. Because now we catch two Finnish stations and one Portuguese but no Dutch, while I had asked you, because we Dutch want to watch the news every month every time they send us exile here. So I would like to ask you once again to make sure we can catch a Dutch station. Madam Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda of the cosmetics meeting on Wednesday. I hope it will be examined in a positive spirit. Mrs. Lynne, you are absolutely right and I will find out if all of this has not been done. I will also put the problem on the body of the cosmetics and I am sure that our dean will be zealous and acting to respect the regulations that we are actually voting for. Madam President, Mrs DNEZ Gonzlez and I myself had asked some questions about specific views of Vice President De Palacio, who were presented in a Spanish newspaper. The competent services have not included them on the agenda because they considered that they had already answered a previous meeting. I beg you to review this decision, because this is not true. The questions that were previously answered were referring to Mrs Palacio's intervention in a specific case and not the statements, which were published in the ABC newspaper on 18 November. Dear colleague, we will find all this.	el
Under these conditions, could the Commission indicate when it intends to note, under article 7.1, the existence of a serious and persistent violation by a Member State of the principles set out in article 6 paragraph 1 and to urgently pray, ruling the qualified majority, to suspend some of the rights arising from the application of this treaty to Austria, in particular the voting rights of the representative of Austria to the Council?Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start to respond by recalling the position that the commission had adopted with regard to the composition of the new Austrian government, reiterated this morning by President Romano Prodi about the Austrian government, which contains ministers belonging to the Austrian freedom of Mr. Jörg Haider.I refer, of course, to the declaration made by the Commission on February 1, 2000, which I will start by recalling the main lines.The Commission said and reaffirms today that it shares the underlying concerns of the January 31 declaration of the Portuguese presidency.These concerns are legitimate and founded.There is no need to recall here the political journey of Mr. Jörg Haider and his many xenophobic and racist public statements, therefore anti-European.The fact that a clearly extremist, racist and xenophobic party comes to power in a member state of the European Union cannot fail to concern other states which participate in the European project, in the same way that it does not leave the European Commission indifferent.Second, the Commission reiterated and reiterates the commitment it has made to continue to exercise its duty as a guardian of the treaties, in particular with regard to articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on the European Union.One of the important innovations of the Amsterdam Treaty consists in the introduction of an explicit mention of the fundamental principles which constitute the common heritage of the Member States and the creation of a mechanism of control of their respect as well as a reaction in the event of violation of one of these principles.The Commission has thus demonstrated in practice its attachment to one of the fundamental principles: that of the rule of law.This principle obliges the Commission to act within the limits fixed by the treaties and it is in this context that its declaration of February 1 is located.The Commission is not a state and cannot or must act in such quality.But, to respond concretely to the question of the Honorable MP, it should be recalled that the mechanism established by article 7, paragraph 1, of the Treaty on the European Union requires, to be activated, that I quote, the existence of a serious and persistent violation of principles set out in article 6. A serious and persistent violation, I repeat, constitutes the essential condition so that the Commission can proposethe adoption of measures against a Member State.It seems obvious to me that the conditions for applying this mechanism to the situation in Austria are not met.Furthermore, I think I am not mistaken in saying that we all hope that these conditions of serious and persistent violation of human rights and democracy will never be combined either for Austria, or for any other Member State of the Union.	fr
Namely, the entire public administration (municipalities, regions, state) must be represented in decision-making in its entirety, with all its management levels, although it is true that local action groups must form a balanced and representative part of the different social economic districts in the area. So we considered the wording of the report too narrow. The revision 12, in turn, meets the expectations of the European Parliament Regional Policy Committee. It includes the necessary coordination between the Leader+Initiative and Partnership Programs such as Interreg, Phare, Sapard or Meda programs. Different community initiatives may be related to each other in the territory of the Member States of the European Union, the Union Candidate States or the Member States of the EFTA. It should be remembered that the true priority of the European continent is to create an operational level in Europeans and not in global framework, as the rapporteur suggests. Of course, the European Union may benefit the establishment of organizations such as local action groups on the condition that different partners take care of the corresponding costs. Of course, we are in favor of this Leader+Community Initiative. It should be remembered that rural development was defined at a conference on rural development, held in Cork on 7.9. November 1996, one of the European Union's priorities in the sense that it is essential to protect our agriculture and the integrity of our agriculture and the entire rural structures (infrastructures, public and private services ...). In this context, we complained about the funds for rural development in the committee, and we supported the checks that required the increase in the budget of this Community Initiative to correspond to previous Leader I and Leader II initiatives. The seven -year Leader+initiative is half -less than the Leader II initiative, which lasted six years. This is unacceptable, given the importance of rural development and the consequences of decrease in prices and subsidies for farmers after the Berlin contract's contract reform. In the end, I say, with regard to the primary criteria for presenting European levels and enabling local projects, that special attention must be paid to the quality and distinctiveness of the projects already carried out in accordance with the Leader II initiative, but which could not be completed due to the schedule of the projects and their management systems.(The session was suspended at 1:40 pm and continued at 3:00 pm.) Feed additives on the agenda are the next Graefe Zu Baringdorf's report on Agriculture and Rural Development (A5-0015/2000)C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168 (CNS))..(De) Mr President, Member of the Commission by Byrne, Directive 70/524/EEC provides that high -tech additives are treated in different ways in terms of substitutions that exist. In this respect, the Commission has now proposed harmonization of the approval procedure in order to be treated with the subject of acceptable substances before 1988. In this respect, we consider the Directive change in the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development. However, this Directive also includes the approval of antibiotics, drug -like substances, growth promoters and genetically modified organisms. In this respect, it is about health and not simple legislation. Therefore, in the Committee on Agriculture, we are of the opinion that the legal basis - Article 37 - cannot be used in this context, but that the Commission must propose us a legal basis under Article 152 of the European Union, ie the right of the parliamentary decision. We have asked the committee on the legal matters of Parliament, which suggested that Article 37 would be sufficient in this case as regards the approximation of this legislation. However, in the Committee on Agriculture, we have not been limited to this approximation of the legislation, but we have suggested that this proposal is also about genetically modified organisms, another proposal for a question of content and thus the health of the population. We negotiated a Directive for seed trade with the Commission for two years and found a compromise that regulates the distribution of genetically modified organisms in this Directive. In that case, we took a text as the basis for this Directive 70/524/EEC.	fi
It is the only solution that guarantees that sailors can live and work in satisfactory conditions that they are safeguarded by legislation and effective social protection, and that fishing and the environment are respected. After each maritime accident, a parliamentary resolution has been approved. It usually proposes positive technical measures, some of which end up in the Directives. If they were to apply, they would actually oppose the logic of the cost of reducing the convenience flagships. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, as a presenter of the Directive, which applies to the reception equipment of waste and cargo residues on board in ports, and at the same time preventing the sea pollution, I want to make a couple of remarks that have come to my mind and, in my opinionIt was reported that 5-10 % of the oil pollution would result in disaster. Although the contamination caused by the disaster is concentrated in a particular area and cause a lot of problems there, 60 % of all oil pollution comes from the industry. And to mention one more benchmark, 10 % of the pollution is part of natural emissions. Without particularly interfering with technical improvements or tightening control and legislation, all of which are all necessary, I would like to propose a kind of socially responsible entrepreneurial spirit inspired by a circular table with those parties who have somehow participated in the pollution of the seas with oil. I would like to invoke it. I would just like to thank Fischler, a member of the Commission, for the answer he gave the oral question by our committee. I think he gave us important information, and it is worth thanking the Commission members for giving us concrete and important information. In the case of Erika, I think that action has been taken and that they are coordinated with the French authorities. However, we have mainly been concerned about the fact that we no longer have to discuss this, because at the heart of the matter is preventive measures. I wanted to point out that you mentioned that the Commission intends to meet and introduce several technical and legislative measures. I think we have to proceed just this way. I just want to tell you that we are very positive about the actions and that we are very closely following these actions in the Fisheries Committee so that we would not have to gather in Parliament to apologize for the facts as we do now. I have received five resolution proposals left to be dealt with in accordance with Article 42 (2) of the Rules of Procedure. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered at 11am. The EC and Israel trade agreement on the agenda is the following oral question (B5-0012/2000) asked by the EC and Israel trade agreement by the EC and others. The thing we are supposed to discuss today is simple: respect, application and implementation of agreements signed by the European Union, respect for international agreements and regulations to which the European Union is committed to. It's a simple thing, but often the simple things in this world are difficult to do. This is the purpose of the colleagues that, together with me, have asked the Commission: the question concerns the correct application of the EC and Israel trade agreement, as Israel openly violates this agreement - we not only have reason to believe that, but with several Member States, concrete evidence of this. At the same time, we also have reason to believe that the Commission is not working hard enough in a task that should be of paramount importance for its operations: to act as the supervisor of the Community's contracts. We mean Article 38 of the Regional Explance, where the scope of the agreement is limited to the territory of the State of Israel and therefore does not allow customs relief to the products derived from Israeli in June 1967, which, without disregarding all international rules,, starting from the fourth Geneva General, several Israeli governments have built a dedicationPalestinian land and water areas and transferred their own population to these areas.	fi
.This is a sector where liberalization has shown its limits and serious shortcomings.I am not personally an activist bounded by the monopoly, whether it is public or private ... But when I see the results of private companies in this area, I am comforted and reinforced in my position as a defender of the public service!If continuous liberalization, in this area too, the risk is great to one day see complete regions not served by post.Which can indeed believe for a moment that private companies, the only engine of which is profit, would continue to serve high cost areas except to charge this cost by already disadvantaged residents, and which therefore could not benefit from it.I add that today, when Europe turns out and is unable to oppose the presence of fascists in a government of the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to see us impose an ultraliberalism destructive of public services, on behalf of this same Europe.I am a European and even a federalist.To get there, I was ready, I am ready to make sacrifices ... but not to any price!And above all I am no longer ready to accept the construction of a single liberal market if Europe is not at the same time able to defend the values ​​which founded it and which made me, from the 1960s, a convinced European!The president.Parliament has exhausted the agenda.The minutes of this session will be subject to the adoption of the Parliament at the start of the next session period. 1 Interruption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament.(The session is lifted at 11:10 am) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which had been interrupted on Friday February 18, 2000. Communication from the president dear colleagues, as you know, on February 22, ETA again brutally struck in Spain, with the assassination of Fernando Buesa Blanco, secretary general of the socialist party and spokespersonfrom the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.The same day, I wanted to express, in my personal name and that of our European Parliament, the expression of our deep sympathy and our sincere condolences with regard to the families of the victims.These men have paid their attachment to democracy with their lives.I wanted to condemn this act of barbarism unworthy of any civilized society very firmly.The rule of law and respect for rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.Terrorism, whatever its form, is unacceptable.By wishing these men to be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organization to put an end to the use of violence and to use the existing democratic ways in Spain.I invite you, dear colleagues, to observe a minute of silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	fr
Resolution on women in the decision-making process (B5-0180/2000) my group abstained on the resolution on women in the decision-making process, to our great regret.But he regrets even more than such resolutions are always necessary.In 1994, the group of Greens was the first group of this Parliament where women were in the majority, it was the first group to have a female secretary general, Dominique Voynet, now French Minister of the Environment, and the German Greens were the first political party to apply equality in matters of sex in order to correct the global sub-statement of women within political institutions.Since then, this initiative has been followed by certain parties and it cannot be said that voters have risen to condemn these parties of their actions.Voters also did not feel manipulated by such quotas.The resolution clearly says that the proportional system, which allows the representation of women, is necessary and that political parties must act in this sense.We are delighted.We understand with those who argue that people should be selected on the basis of their merits;Which is true.Our culture should allow a balance between sexes and people should be able to develop their talents whatever they are, but for the time being, our culture and our values ​​do not reflect this conviction.Prejudices, clichés, are very widespread.We will hardly be surprised that people from minorities, whether black, homosexual, disabled, etc., are the subject of discrimination and inequitable treatment if a majority group, women, must also undergo this discrimination.Our group therefore supports positive action, it is only when women are fairly represented in the decision -making process that men will also be fairly represented.We should therefore also create a culture where your paid and not paid work, your salary, your parental leave and your pension do not depend on your gender..While International Women's Day is fast approaching, I wish to reaffirm my support for action carried out within institutions and member states with a view to promoting the accession of women to positions of responsibility, especially in politics.This is why I will vote with conviction the text of this resolution which urges us to take more proactive measures to fight the discrimination which persist and prevent women from occupying the place that returns to them in our society!The promotion of women in the decision-making process has been one of the priority areas of the European Union program for equal opportunities and is one of the repeated commitments of the Union institutions as well as Member States since 1995.However, if in recent years, progress has been made thanks to strategies such as mainstreaming and additional measures such as positive actions, they are too few to be satisfactory.The underlying representation of women in politics, for example, continues to be a reality.However, we know the importance of seeing many women engage in politics.	fr
"However, there are examples of good practices, as the Baltic coastal countries have already implemented this fees since 1998. I am absolutely aware that this will cause problems in the organization of ports in many Member States and will burden ships with additional costs. But is this the price to be paid as a guarantee of the purity of the marine environment, as the directive provides that ships that are less polluted should be able to be identified and paid for reduced fees? This system is in my opinion fair, and therefore I vote. This Directive proposal is welcome in the European Union. It is part of the overall community strategy aimed at reducing marine pollution and waste management and obliges all port ports, including Ports of yachts, to have appropriate waste receipt facilities that meet the needs of ships. There was already international law, as the MARPOL Convention imposes all ships binding international rules on the basis of which all rejections at sea are prohibited. But the problem that arises is, of course, to apply and observe these rules! The polite authority of ""Policycular Payments"", in which many Member States are committed, including mine, is well respected! Unfortunately, this reality is the destruction of Erika as well as the thirty -nine cleaning of gas tanks, which took place in a week! For this European Parliament and the Parliamentary Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, confirming the position taken at the first reading during the previous parliamentary period, they proposed all ships that engage in a port of Member State to be burdened with 90% of the cost of receiving and unanimously. We believe that this is the only true and fair way to prevent these inappropriate rejections at sea. Indeed, if the port facilities are funded (to a large extent) only by the ships that use them, there is great fear many of them to avoid this burden, since rejection at sea is cheaper. In addition, we want to determine at 25% of the proportion of ships subject to mandatory inspections. On the eve of the European Union's presidency from France, this is the position that French socialists intend to support, and I can only call our parliament to do the same. This is a political struggle. However, is our role not exactly to carry out it, even if this will lead us to make ambitious political decisions that are sometimes beyond the decisions of our governments and always aiming high and are promising? Fr) We cannot ignore that this second reading of the proposal of a directive against marine pollution with Erika's current tragic wreck is happening today. This text does not, of course, concern the accidents that cause pollution, but we are well aware that, although more disguised, the consequences of pirate tanks cleaning of gases at sea are just as serious."	el
But at the same time I would like to assure you that if needed, we will not hesitate to move the process. Here are the values ​​of extremely fundamental and essential importance so that there is no room for any reflection or compromise. People and governments should be judged more than their actions and less of their words. And in this case of Austria, the least we can say is that the statements that are expressed are contradictory. On the one hand, each of us could stand up to various arson declarations by the leader of the Austrian Liberal Party. On the other hand, the program presented by the newly established Austrian government is pushing its commitment to defending the values ​​of democracy and human rights. Soon we will have a first and excellent opportunity to ascertain which of the two masks of the Austrian government is the true. I am referring to the attitude of the Austrian government to the Council, when the Commission's proposals on the launch of an action program to combat discrimination, which will be accompanied by two instructions: one that looks forward to the implementation of the principle of equal treatment of people, regardless of the labor, is being put to the table.of national or racial descent, religion, disability or sexual preferences. These are texts of prominent importance, which are approved under Article 13 of the Treaty, which gives the community responsibilities to promote the struggle against discrimination due to race, of national origin, sex, etc. Such a need. Thanks to the Commissioner for the answer he gave to my question. But is the Vitorino Commissioner not only about the words of Mr Haider and the liberal Austrian party, but also for their actions? Mr Haider actually participated in the Self -Government in the southern province of Karinthia, where he led a racist and xenophobic campaign against the Slovan -speaking minority in the region - which is Austrian citizens - where he attempted to abolish the bilingual education and the bilingual education of the communities. Could the Commissioner answer two questions? First, he talked about control. Can he tell us how to check and who will conduct him? Secondly, does it not agree that if the current government will continue at national level the kind of policy followed by Mr Haider and the Austrian Liberal Party at Local Government level, then there will be a clear violation of Article 6, paragraph 1, of the Treaty on Fundamental Rights? We are not talking about words here. We are talking about the actions of the liberal party of Austria and Mr Haider.((()) It is quite clear to me that it is the responsibility of the Commission to closely monitor the evolution of the situation in the Member States in accordance with the procedures and standards referred to in Article 6 and justify the use of Article 7 of the Treaty.	el
Then you would have one ally to drive your policy. The Mr President, the Mr President of the Council, the Mr President of the Commission, is gratifying and encouraging to hear that the Parliament - as has been heard here - a new strategic goal of the coming decade, namely, to make the European Union more and more dyly and competitive in the European Union. We would be able to increase economic growth by creating more and better jobs and increasing social cohesion. It is clear that we need to redefine Europe's role in the global economy by creating a competitive Europe, enabling new and better jobs to be created and implemented through a precise strategy for social cohesion. Employment and social policy play a key role in creating this new society for two reasons. On the one hand, there is financial efficiency, as technological advances are central to the quality of human resources. On the other hand, there is social equality because, despite the current rise in the economy, our society still has a huge amount of social inequalities. Unemployment, social exclusion and the risks associated with the future imbalance of social security systems are problems that only worsen global worldwide, population aging, technological changes, population growth, and more visible challenges created by women in working life. Europe must achieve full employment. Full employment that fits into a society that is being formed, where women and men have better opportunities. European citizens must believe in this project and this reality;They are not allowed to see it as an abstract thing we just talk about in Brussels or Strasbourg. Right now, we are asking for a transition to a new society, innovation, information society, and knowledge and skills. We need to learn quickly, create new practices that are better suited to this new society, and to invest in technological changes without forgetting people or institutions. Lisbon will be an advanced step, and we must be able to renew the European social model, as it is only possible to increase jobs and at the same time social cohesion. Therefore, we need to focus on some primary issues: we need to improve the effectiveness of active employment policies, strengthen synergies between flexibility, education and lifelong learning, increase service jobs by promoting entrepreneurship and reducing the administrative burden of small and medium -sized enterprises, and finallyIn policies, in particular, emphasize areas that facilitate the coordination of work and family life. All this must be done for European citizens. It has to be done in terms of the men and women who work and live everyday life on our corn. The Extraordinary Meeting of Lisbon must reassure European citizens that the European Union is faithful to a society that promotes society and social cohesion. Mr President, Presidential State Portugal, has to consider the concentration of the debate on the issues without which they are new, approaching in a renewed way and daring goals, starting with the urgent need to seize the challenge of innovation and continuous democratic competitiveness and knowing that the technological development of the USto protectionism. Japan also has to be appreciated as it gives Europe the organization of work, as well as the responsibility of the state and companies, as well as the employee in achieving business goals. Of these two models, we need to adopt what is useful, such as corporate capacity and work organization, and maintain what is best in Europe, that is, a social model suitable for its after -industry economy. It is true that Europe needs 32 million jobs to reach the US employment rate, increase women's jobs, adapt marginalized groups, strengthen social cohesion (structural funds have not yet been resolved) and integrate five million long -term unemployed, many of which are as a result of business reorganization.	fi
Instead of making these goals legally binding, we need to look at their political nature. It is also evident in several Parliament reviews. This Directive format European water policy for water fees for the next three decades. We already need to ensure that this directive urges and encourages creating an effective payment structure and pricing that will improve our environment in a cost -effective manner. It sounds good that water must belong to human rights and that it should be free. However, water is not free - no more than homes and food. Water can only be treated better and more frugally using efficient control tools. In addition, I would like to say that I support the tighter timetable and clearer objectives, as well as exceptional criteria for groundwater and the effect of human activity, and also support the explicit mention of radioactive substances. During the discussion, many speakers have pointed out how important it is for citizens to receive information and negotiate with them. I want to emphasize it even further. We need to make citizens participate by providing them with appropriate information and an opportunity to influence before making the final decisions. It is also mentioned in the introductory section 14. Also, let me say to Parliament, Bow, that like my Scottish colleague, he can sometimes enjoy a few glasses of Scottish whiskey with a good conscience! The Commission has not considered the need to restrict very limited water intake in whiskey production. Allow me to comment on some things in a little more detail. One of the most important objectives is to limit the emissions of hazardous substances that end up in the aquatic environment. I am glad that Parliament's checks focus on it. The Commission fully supports the inclusion of the obligations referred to in the OSPAR NN. However, we need to stick to their exact content and extent. As I said, the objective and schedule for OSPAR can be considered mainly as a political obligation. The introduction of a legally binding timetable would conflict with this. However, it must be ensured that the Member States and the Community take action to achieve these goals and to follow the schedules. Therefore, I consider the 6, 10, 14, 24, 24, 58, 60 and 88. The Commission proposes that we introduce a clear classification of substances and therefore do not need any definition. Although I agree with the contents of the checks 79 and 106, they go beyond the OSPAR obligations and therefore cannot accept these reviews. In principle, the Commission may also approve a review of 60, which requires a timetable for the Commission's proposal to limit the emissions of priority. Review 59 introduces a requirement for regular review of the priority list. It would cause legal uncertainty about the status of the list, and we cannot accept it for the sake of it. We cannot accept the proposed 60 and 93 requirements for the target list of the subjects and the list for which no information required. The legal status of such lists would be unclear and do not comply with the procedures for approval of the list of priority. In this context, I want to emphasize that the OSPAR agreement does not in any way change the existing community legislation relating to nitrates in agriculture. This Framework Directive is therefore not affected by the Nitrate Directive. I appreciate the fact that Parliament shows flexibility in a very sensitive and difficult issue related to covering the cost of water services. I can with all my heart to support the requirement that the price of water should be set to a level that provides users with sufficient incentives for sustainable water resources. I also support the requirement that each sector must participate in sufficient extent to cover their own costs. Therefore, I can partially and in principle approve of 43-46 and check 85.	fi
"Until the Amsterdam Treaty there were about 20 variants of these processes through committees. This was not added to the issue of clarity in the application of legislation or to transparency for citizens. On the contrary, the European Parliament was not even informed for a long time. The first step forward in improving the transparency in the labyrinth of the committees was to inform at least Parliament to be informed of the issues that the Commission intends to regulate within these various committees. This happened in 1988 as part of the exchange of letters between Plumb and Delors. A further step in the direction of the transparency and participation of the European Parliament was subsequently the so -called Modus Vivendi on September 20, 1994, where not only the right to information, but also some possibility to obtain objections was granted to Parliament. Thus, Parliament also acquired control. The Treaty of Amsterdam has been a decisive improvement, as the number of procedures through committees has been reduced to three, as the European Parliament has long been demanding, which is management, regulatory and consulting. The rights and audit rights that have been assigned to the European Parliament in the past must now be re -established after the Amsterdam Treaty through an organized agreement. The rapporteur, Mr Frassoni, worked with great care and showed the issues that must be clarified under the organizing agreement and the administrative procedures that may be amended within Parliament. One of the main problems is the ""time"" factor. When Parliament is informed, it must usually consult, if he wishes, within a very short period of four weeks. On issues related to the health and safety of people in the European Union, the European Commission as a guardian of the conditions and only an institution with the right to initiative must be able to react very soon, if necessary within a few hours or days. However, the right of the European Parliament must be preserved to be informed and react if it is needed. The rapporteur suggests very good solutions for this problem, which I and my team highly support. I would like to formulate another plea. In the German translation, paragraph 2 is somewhat unclear and please correct, then by those responsible for printing. In my opinion, it must say ""they must be maintained"" instead of ""they must continue"". It's not so clear in the German text. Please check the excerpt again. Otherwise, thank you very much to the rapporteur. The object of the exhibition is difficult and I hope we have now shaped it so that we can handle it better. Mr President, I congratulate the rapporteur on her report. I have to add that it is a pleasant change to see Mrs Frassoni in such a alternative mood, willing to reach compromises with the rest of the institutions. As for the intergovernmental conference, are those who call the French ""Les Pures et Dures"": Neither compromises nor agreements with other institutions. We prefer to block the whole issue rather than to compromise our positions."	el
First, the new attention that they dedicate to the Mediterranean, of course, fulfills me with satisfaction, be it because the European Union thus contributes to the Middle East Peace process or because the historical and political bonds between the countries of Southeast Europe are continued and expanded.In view of the current geopolitical processes, the limit of the Mediterranean in our opinion is to be used to eat the same importance as that of Parliament and Commission.Second: internal market.As members of the European Parliament, we consider harmonizing the existing civil law provisions essential.Maybe we should gradually deal with administrative rights.In addition, we feel every day how urgently a common law needs, the sources of which are coordinated.Third: Preparation files.I agree with the demand to limit the number of these acts that are presented to the European Parliament several times and from different sides.Although green books, white books and communications - which is certainly very important - contribute to deepening the debate, they also have a complicated and problematic side effect, since they mostly delay the legal measures in areas that are absolutely necessary to act quickly.Last point: In my opinion, two areas were neglected in the Commission program, which the European institutions, especially in view of the increasing spread of electronic business, have to pay special attention.The Commission should submit proposals for the extrajudicial regulation of disputes over the so-called online contracts and to change the directive on contracts in distance sales in order to continuously improve consumer protection.President!As for fishing, I do not want to deal with details of the Commission's legislative proposal.Rather, I would like to receive the clear promise that the Commission will look for a solution to quickly implement the recommendations of regional and international fishing organizations into a community regulation.Already in the previous session period, we had on the occasion of the ICCAT recommendations for the Red Thun in the Mediterranean opportunity to discuss this question of the commission's delays.The delays threaten to become an extremely serious problem, because these recommendations become binding in a certain period of time, but since they are not included in the community legislation, this favors the non -compliance with the measures due to the fleets and can lead to the initiation of violation against the European Union.The hemslock in the implementations is an endemic problem for the Commission.For example, we have been waiting for the ban on landings from Honduras and Belize in the Community regulation since 1996 or, for example, since 1998 for the inclusion of the control of the catch of white thun in the community waters.The Commission constantly accuses Member States that they do not implement the resolutions or guidelines of the Commission into national law while doing the same in the international area.Obviously, the commission proposal about a change in the international organizations is trying to separate both Parliament and the Council from the legislative procedure for greater speed.From the perspective of our institution, the serious doubts raises whether this is the best way to solve this problem.I expect President PRODI to be an obligation here that this question will be solved once and for all and that Parliament is always included in the legislative procedure for taking the recommendations of the international fishing organizations in the Community Present.	de
We no longer have the choice.It's imperative.European citizens will not accept anything lower than the quality of life that suits them as human beings.We do not want the US model - a model that has spectacularly failed to create the use necessary for a decent quality of life.This model has dramatically increased the number of workers poor in the United States.This is not what we want to do in Europe.Solidarity is in the traditions of Europe and we enjoy experience which consists in doing things better.However, we have to seize the tools necessary to do this.This is the reason why I urged that we were setting up the high -level group, as proposed by the Commission, but also that we were going later and that we have a process based on that of Luxembourg so that we have an integrated approach to this issue relating to social protection.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union must pay the greatest attention.In fact, macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the nominal convergence criteria have acted as many obstacles to a modernization of social protection likely to contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of the populations, in particular through a significant increase in pensions and pensions -particularly minimums -, and a fight against social exclusion.This situation is particularly serious for countries such as Portugal, where minimum retirement barely exceeds half of the national minimum wage, which is the lowest in the whole European Union.Also, as long as the Commission does not recognize the need to modify macroeconomic policies to create more quality jobs and guaranteeing the rights of their holders, which constitutes the fundamental basis for the maintenance and modernization of a solid social protection system, will be maintained the biggest reserves about its position.Although the Anderson report has integrated positive proposals, including some of those we had presented, it still contains part of the bases that we had criticized in the initial proposal of the Commission and the strategy of modernization of social protection continues to concern us.Mr. President, previously, I directed two manufacturing companies, one in the United Kingdom and the other in the Netherlands.The company located in the United Kingdom developing, we invest in personnel increases and as the company, in the Netherlands, developed, we invest in additional machines.The reason was simply that social costs were too high in the Netherlands.I am in favor of social protection, I am in favor of the original document of the Commission but I do not want to see people lose their jobs because the costs in terms of social protection become unrealistic and too high.This is the reason why I asked, in committee, that an impact assessment on businesses be carried out, so that the costs and risks involved by jobs can be taken into account and the PPE-DE Group supported this amendment.However, I must remember that other groups, led by the PSE group, itself led by my compatriot Stephen Hugues, voted against this amendment.I accept the fact that Mr. Andersson's report is inhabited by the best intentions and I respect him for the work he has done but, in my eyes, the way in which the report defines and promotes social convergence would cause an increase in social costs throughout the EU.	fr
Finally, I would say that in my opinion, the sixth seasonal report presents interesting aspects from the perspective of a sustainable and balanced real development project on Europe, precisely because it presents a synthesis of the importance of the relationship between the European Center and the remote areas. Although the Commission is still hesitantly hesitant to disclose, the seasonal report shows us how urgent it is to favor multi -central development in the community through structural policies of the Union and within the framework of the community's regional development plan. Mr President, the Social Democratic group of the European Parliament, shares the content of the report presented by the rapporteur Berend, and congratulates the report of the quality of his or her final conclusions and the flexibility, which made it possible to incorporate checks from different groups in the Committee. In the current situation, it must also be remembered that the overall competitiveness of the European Union is 81 % of the competitiveness of the United States of America, and that this figure will only improve if our economic units, ie regions, improves, and the situation is such that technical development, economic and our problems, the expansion of the Union and the common money, and that are also greatTask efforts. The sixth seasonal report of the European Commission presents quite valid conclusions. I take two of them the rapporteurs already reminded of those, one of which is positive and the other negative. The first concerns that regional and social cohesion has gained significant progress throughout the Union and that community funds have been important, although not a decisive factor in smoothing the inequalities between the regions. The negative fact is that these great efforts closer to the figures describing GDP or the productivity figures in the Union areas than smoothed employment differences. Therefore, it is essential to connect structural financing and workplace creation. Member of the Commission, this is the most important guideline for the next season. Mr President, so I ask my valuable colleagues that they would accept this report, and, like other colleagues, ask the Commission that the Commission would keep the program period 20002006 in a strict mind in the sixth period of the period. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, the Member of the Dear Colleagues, initially I would like to thank the rapporteur for their good work and also for the proposal for the proposals for the proposals during the committee proceedings. The sixth seasonal report provides the basis for assessing the implementation of the union's regional policy objectives. The report shows that, despite all the efforts, growth is uneven. Very rapid growth will continue in central Europe. The strongest centers are also constantly growing faster than the European average, while many southern Europeans and northern regions are developing much slower. Now we need a in -depth analysis of why regional policy does not bring the desired result in all regions. Is there any reason for the bureaucracy or is there any differences between the regions, long distances, too cold or too hot, sparsely populated and harsh conditions have been taken into account? How can the Union respond to the challenges of global development so that weaker developed areas remain involved in development? It is also important to find out the effects of the Union's expansion on the Structural Funds and the development of more remote areas of the Union. Member States must also remember their responsibilities. Some Member States have violated the increase in the principle and reduced national regional grants as regional support through the Union has increased. This has eaten the results of regional policy. In the future, the development of the indicators must also be considered to be able to direct the measures to the right place at the right time. For example, uncontrolled migration has not been sufficiently taken into account. Here too, it is necessary to emphasize the crucial importance of small and medium -sized enterprises as an employer and as an engine of regional development. It is particularly important to transfer the latest technology and skill knowledge to the use of companies in slower developing areas. Our group supports the acceptance of this report. The Mr President, the Members of the Commission, the good colleagues, the European Community's regional policy has so far not succeeded in significantly overhanging the differences between the residents' gross people.	fi
"The rights of information and control obtained in the past by the Parliament must now be clearly redefined, according to the Treaty of Amsterdam, by an interinstitutional agreement.Our rapporteur, Ms. Frassoni, has accomplished meticulous work and highlighted the questions which must be clarified within the framework of this interinstational agreement as well as the internal administrative procedures in Parliament which must possibly be modified.The main problem remains the time factor.When Parliament is informed, it must, as a rule, take a position within four weeks, if it wishes.As soon as questions involved the health and security of citizens in the European Union, the Commission, which has the role of guardian of the treaties and which remains the sole institution endowed with the right of initiative, must be able to react very quickly, sometimes in a few days, even in a few hours.However, the law of the European Parliament to information and possibly reaction must be preserved.Compared to these difficulties, our rapporteur offers very useful solutions that my political group can only support.I still have to send one last request.In point 2 of the German version of the resolution project, a passage was ill -translated.I ask for an emergency a clarification on this subject, and this too, after the fact, from the people responsible for printing.Instead of ""must be renewed"", you had to understand ""must be maintained"".This is not so clearly formulated in the German text.I would therefore like to check this passage.Apart from that, I sincerely thank our rapporteur.It is a difficult material and I hope that the way we have tackled it will now allow us to make better use of it.Mr. President, I congratulate the rapporteur for his report.I must add that seeing Ms. Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and eager to reach compromises with other institutions is a pleasant change.When it comes to the CIG, it is one of those whom the French call ""the pure and hard"": no compromise, not agree with the other institutions;They would prefer that the whole process is blocked rather than making compromises about their position.However, here it is ready to accept the steps forward which were made and which are far from corresponding to the original position of the Parliament on the question of comitology.Let us remember what is at stake in this area.Parliament had four main criticisms with regard to the comitology system as it existed before the new decision of the Council to which this interinstitutional agreement was added.First, the system, as a whole, is obscure.It lacks transparency and hundreds of committees with secrets of the secret day meeting without anyone knowing who sits within each committee.A real step forward was completed in the new system that has been adopted.We will know who sits on each committee.We will know when they come together.We will get the orders of the day.We will obtain the documents sent to them.The whole system will be more open and more transparent - even if it remains rather complex."	fr
Even in member states and in very rich cities, a large number of people live in ghettos, with inadequate facilities, where education is very low, where physical infrastructure is underdeveloped and where drugs and other phenomena are widespread.It seems to me that, for the European Union to prove that it contributes to helping citizens of the European Union, it must help the Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and for their families.This program was very productive in Ireland, as it has been, I know, in other countries.It took a long time to start there, but the reason is that the inhabitants of the region had to develop these programs themselves.It is important that they use their own spirit of initiative and their own local skills in the development of this initiative.It would be very easy to ensure rapid development and respecting deadlines if professional experts from the outside were involved, but this would undermine the general objective of the Urban program.I want to make a remark before concluding: we must insist that where the funding is allocated and where this program is developed, this is done as part of a serious urban development policy.Alas, this is not the case with Ireland.I applaud the innovative approach to the Equal program and the objective to integrate discriminated groups into the job market.Development partnerships are a very judicious idea, although they are experimental.However, I have two major concerns about development partnerships.They should be accessible to smaller groups so that they can design, work and control the programs.Programs must be very flexible.I have also expressed my concern in the past as to the use of a simple language and not a jargon, so that everyone can have access to it.I am delighted to see that we have taken into account in this report, but I cannot accept amendment 9 because it is really not written in a simple language.My second concern was that certain discriminated groups encounter specific problems, for example access to people with disabilities at their workplace.Projects should also specifically deal with this problem.These concerns should be taken into account when defining the programs.I, of course, intend to do so with organizations and groups in my constituency, in the West Midlands.I now come to the controversial question of asylum seekers and refugees.Although I am not in favor of the fact that the refugees who have been refused the status of refugees and who were threatened with repatriation have access to Equal, I will support the possibility of access to Equal for all the other asylum seekers and refugees.It is only fair and equitable that they can have access to Equal in the same way as anyone else.Mr. President, my dear colleagues, with the leader report, rural development is in the spotlight.	fr
The action plan will include more than 80 separate measures for the coming period and aims to fix the loopholes observed in current legislation. The new legal frame covers feed, animal health and well -being, hygiene, pollution and residues, new foods, additives, spices, packaging and radiation. It contains a proposal for general food legislation that expresses the principles of food safety such as the responsibility of the feed, farmers and food actors, the traceability of feed, food and ingredients, and appropriate risk analysis, for example, risks assessment - in other words, scientific advice and data analysisthe application of information and, if necessary, the application of pre -preparedness principles. With regard to the pre -preparedness principle, I could add that the Commission is currently completing a communication, which will hopefully be given very soon. I hope that this afternoon we can use a useful exchange of views with parliamentary members who would clearly have preferred to do this last week if it had had a proper parliamentary forum. However, I have been in contact with the chairmen of the committees concerned and I understand that it was not possible. However, I also know that in the coming months we will still have many opportunities to look at the white book suggestions for the authority. We now have several months to have a necessary discussion on the proposals of the Commission's White Book concerning the establishment of the European Food Authority. Parliament will play a key role in this debate. Parliament had a vital part in how Europe reacted to the BSE crisis. Since then, it has been particularly active in highlighting citizens' concerns about food safety. I expect Parliament to have an equally accurate and constructive contribution from the authority to a discussion. Although we have several months before the end of April to discuss the question and put together opinions, I fully admit that the schedule is also very tight. I would ask the parliament to take care of the necessary arrangements to present its views as soon as possible. It is imperative that the Commission may benefit from the contribution of Parliament to the establishment of an authority that is central to raising consumer health to a new level and thus returning consumers' confidence in the European Union's food safety system. In the next few years, the European Food Authority will be a key ingredient in the EU food safety system. It is imperative that the ingredients are proportional. Mr President, I thank the Commission member for his communication. I am positive about the division of labor and that food management remains the responsibility of the Union institutions such as the Commission and Parliament. It's the right approach. However, there is one word that I have not heard you mention here today. We must have a food legislative body, as you have said, and we must agree on this together. It is very important that we include responsibility in the process. It was that word I meant. The problem has been that taxpayers have paid if something has gone wrong. This cannot continue. When we get to the crisis, we need to find out in advance that if there is a problem, the cause of the problem is responsible. Mr President, it was a very good white book and I have no comment on the authority. My questions apply to the list of allowable feeds. You have expressed this unclearly in your White Book. What is your schedule, how quickly do you get a list of allowable feeds? When are the same requirements for feed and their production as food production and its control? The last part of my question: When do BSE tests become binding in all Member States? Here, too, you have expressed a little unclear in your white book. Thanks for your communication, a Member of the Commission. I believe that the principles of the food safety authority you have prepared recognize the facts. Member States would not accept the regulatory agency, so you should not propose much. Some areas of the food industry are clearly in need of better regulation, and it is in a matter of clear feed.	fi
The only way to suppress negative ideas is to express others.I come back to the subject of our debate: I am deeply convinced of the value and democratic power of the debate, especially when it comes to combating demagogy.Mr. Barnier, you emphasized in your explanation how important the dialogue is with European citizens.With regard to the government conference, it is probably the case that the Portuguese presidency is expressly justified according to Helsinki's decisions, to expand the agenda for the government conference during the conference.The parliament is represented with Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatsos.But, Mr. Barnier, could you promise that you will inform Parliament if the agenda is expanded so that we can deal with you within Parliament and in dialogue so that the dialogue with the citizens to whom you place so great value can be continued?.(Fr) Mr. Beazley, my answer is clearly yes, but it is actually not new.The chairman Napolitano and many members of the committee for constitutional questions and even more MPs here in the plenum know that I am ready to report transparently and at the same time during these negotiations on behalf of the Commission.I may do this in other words as Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, their direct representatives.Incidentally, we will probably do this together in many cases.I think it is very important that these negotiations do not take place without constant information from the European Parliament or the national parliaments, especially since they - as I would like to remember - ultimately have to comment in the ratification process.That is why I welcomed Mr. Napolitano's initiative to regularly vote between the national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament.Regardless of this, the obligation to transparency about the reform of the institutions begins here.I will therefore always be available to tell you about our positions and the status of these negotiations in the course of this year.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate the commission on your approach.I think it is crucial to get into conversation with the citizens in good time, which basically neither happened in the contract of Amsterdam nor in the contract of Maastricht and consequently only sown.Two questions: First, they said they wanted to record the dialogue with the citizens and start with 700 interns at the European Commission.Do you commemorate yourself to the population via the media, including the television and the Internet?My second question is critical.The European Commission has just presented a transparency proposal.If I compare it with the proposal to be used in the Netherlands of legislation, then it is far from being ambitious, and this proposal has already met with violent criticism in the Netherlands.I just want to know how you want to guarantee transparency with a view to the government conference, because the now available guideline does not offer a good example.	de
The question of UCITS may seem difficult, technical and fairly risky on the political level.In my opinion, not everyone knows what UCITS represent.However, allow me to highlight with force that this question really concerns European citizens, because it is a question of knowing how their savings will be managed, what are the existing choices, how inter-community competition will work with regard to the different types of savings, if savers are entitled to a certain security as investors, and what possibilities are available to European citizens to prepare their old age.It is also a question of weighing the demand for liberalization aimed at making the market more effective and increasing the profits against the need to protect investors.During the 1980s, most of the markets were the subject of radical deregulation, which had the main consequence of the very rapid development, in a few years, of national financial and bond markets.Collective investment funds have established themselves as an alternative solution to individual banking savings.Sixty percent of the Swedes save through various investment funds.This type of savings provides the investor security due to the diversity of investments.The capital market and the bond market continued their boom.The OCCVM directive in force has become obsolete.New types of investment funds have been introduced in different countries, but the UCITS concerned are not allowed to market their shares in other Member States.This restriction hinders, of course, competition and innovation, and limits possible choices for the public in savings.The proposal of the commission which we deal with today includes two components.The first concerns the products, that is to say the investment funds.The second part has the object of investment organizations.The first proposal essentially aims to extend the possibilities of placement for these organizations, by authorizing them to invest in assets belonging to other investment companies, for example, the shares of other UCITS, the long -term financial contracts and standardized options, deposits in credit institutions and certain types of instruments in the monetary market.Special risk distribution rules, based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, are provided for these investments.The proposal also recommends the implementation of specific rules for the distribution of risks for organizations which aim to reproduce stock market indexes, clues funds.The Economic and Monetary Commission strengthens the requirements in relation to the Commission's proposal.In order to guarantee transparent operation and a healthy situation, investments in non -harmonized funds should only be authorized if qualitative criteria, such as transparency and protection of investors, are implemented.In addition, quantitative criteria should be applied (risk exposure).Allow me, Mr. President, to approach the point which is the subject of a certain disagreement, and which I hope will be overcome later, namely the instruments derived from over.The Commission distinguishes, in its proposal, between the derivative instruments which are negotiated on a regulated market, and those which are not.These are called the instruments derived from over will.According to the commission's proposal, the wranged derived instruments do not enter into the categories of investments that can be possible for UCITS;They should only be used for good portfolio management and risk reduction linked to exchange prices.	fr
Mr President, good members, for all these reasons, the Council follows with interest (and constantly paying attention to it) what a resolution of this Parliament is accepted by this parliament..(PT) The President, Good Members, Commission would like to start by presenting a lot of congratulations to the Parliament Duff and Voggenhuber for their excellent work and that this report we will discuss today emphasizes an inevitable thing: Creating a fundamental court, whether or not,I am convinced that in this way, the Union shows that in the eyes of European citizens it is taking responsibility by making a political gesture that aims to answer the issue of the political and moral justification of the entire European Union in the future. The ambition, which has just been shown by both Members of the Parliament and the Council of the Council, requires that we strive for the extreme to complete the preparation of the preparation of a fundamental rights book in time to bring them into invoices, whether it is an inter-governmental conference or a summit for the State and Government Heads at the end of this year. The Commission would like to start by emphasizing the importance of the composition of the preparatory body that draws up the fundamental rights book. It is the first time that the organ founded by the Council has representatives of both the community and the national institutions, as well as from the legal and executive sector. It is certain that this composition of a communal and national level (which I would say as judgmental) contributes to strengthening the basic book project in the eyes of the public, as well as the success of the preparations currently ongoing. Once again, the Commission would like to make four key aspects to the Parliament: the first is that the Commission generally agrees with Parliament with the objectives of the legal nature of the Charter and its inclusion in the Constitution, as well as the wide range of the rights contained therein. However, I think the report being discussed today also emphasizes that there are some questions that are addressed directly in the design body for which the charter sketches ask questions, such as a list of rights included in the book. However, there are other issues that are above the jurisdiction of the design bodies and are primarily dealt with by the heads of state and government in the European Council, as well as an inter-governmental conference. In fact, the Commission's opinion is that, as stated in paragraph 14 of the Resolution presented by the European Parliament, the legal nature of the Charter must be decided by the Nice European Council. But the Commission believes that the draft book is the beginning of a clear and close text that Union citizens can easily read, but at the same time it must be legally accurate in order to be unifying and binding in nature. The Commission also believes that the Union must enter the European Convention on Human Rights and that this choice cannot be made in the planning bodies of the Charter, but must be made in the Council when deciding on the legal nature of the Charter. It was first supported by the Commission as early as 1979 and again in 1990. It is true that in 1996, the European Court of Justice estimates that the community could not join the European Convention on Human Rights, but I emphasize that it has occurred because there was no right to join that entitlement. Currently, as we are reviewing agreements and at the same time sketching a book of fundamental rights, it is a great time to answer two questions by drawing up a legal book that is legal and by making a political decision to join the European Union to the European Convention on Human Rights. I would like to make another idea here. There is no genetic contradiction for the Union in a fundamental rights book and linked to the European Convention on Human Rights. On the contrary, I would like to remind members that it was at the Parliamentary Assembly that three weeks ago, a large majority of political groups voted to support a recommendation not only to recognize and support the European Union's initiative of the European Union, but to be positively attached to the European Union as part of the European Convention on Human Rights.	fi
"It is true that during the transition period, when the trade of all products cannot yet be fully released, the contract is more advantageous for Mexico than the European Union, but the same asymmetry can also be stated when comparing the development of the European economy and the competitiveness of the Mexican economy. Therefore, it must be admitted that, in spite of this asymmetry, community producers will be much better competitive than the Mexican market than until now. Good Members of the Parliament, based on all of this, the very large majority of the Committee on Industrial, Foreign Trade, Research and Energy recommends voting in favor of this Council's decision concerning the results of the negotiations that we have to control the benefits of which we have to promote a more democratic, more respectful and societal political system. Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, I would like to first thank the member Ferrer for this excellent report. He has worked abnormally a lot of trouble and has also introduced them to this project with Mexico problems and the pros and cons. It is a trade agreement within the European Union, and as you said, we just have the opportunity to say either ""yes"" or ""no"". We cannot renegotiate this agreement. All in all, our group is in favor of this trade agreement, and we also have a positive attitude. By the way, I would like to say that a member of Folias, who sees problems for schools: trade relations between Europe and Mexico have generally always proved to be good in the past. We could have left a member of Lannoye's Chocolate report yesterday as unnecessary if the Mexicans had not donated to us before cocoa. Chocolate - Chocolatl - is the other Mexican word. So this previously collected experience will surely help us to develop relationships with Mexico in the future. The benefit of the contract for Mexico is a clear thing. Mexico can compensate for this agreement with some unilateral addiction from the United States. I would like to remind you that 85 % of Mexican exports go to North America and only 5 % to Europe. The agreement benefits Mexico in the form of a greater balance of trade. The agreement is certainly an advantage for Mexico in the automotive industry, which is otherwise part of the European origin, as cars may then be taken to Europe. By the way, the agreement also benefits us, in any case, to the European industry, whether it is a Mexican market or the fact that through the Mexican market, products can also be exported to the United States. From the point of view of the trade, all this is useful. However, I would like to deal with two problems or at least mention them. Another problem is social problems, that is, Mexico must certainly check its social policy, as social problems are not solved by trade policy alone. There are also losers in this increasing free trade. Poverty has increased rather than decreased in Mexico. So social policy is an important topic for Mexico, and we should also include it in a dialogue with Mexico. Another problem is scientific and technical collaboration. In this respect, I believe there is room for play between Europe and Mexico that we should fully utilize. Mr President, Dear Members of the Parliament, Member of the Commission, a financial partnership, political coordination and cooperation signed with Mexico in December 1997, will be discussed here in the session hall and the commercial measures negotiated within the temporary agreement. A few weeks ago, I went to Mexico to deal with several things and asked Mexicans, among other things, their opinion on the new relationships between Mexico and the European Union, which have been given a lot of publicity in many society media. After analyzing what I saw, I read and heard during my visit in the Federal Republic of Mexico, I came to the same conclusion as Ferrer, who is a rapporteur of the report on the discussion today and is publicly congratulated: this is the best agreement signed by the European Union and will promote the growth of trade and investment."	fi
I believe that the Council of the European Union has brought, over time, obvious evidence that this is not its position.The decisions were made with a great sense of responsibility by the Council.What happened in Helsinki is very clear.Our relations with the Republic of Cyprus in its process of adherence to the European Union constitute an element that the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus recognize themselves as positive.Do not indulge or try to engage in second readings of our intentions.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to sincerely thank you for this debate, which I generally felt as encouraging and which shows that this assembly largely approves the policy of the Member States and the Commission.However, I would like to provide the clarifications that have been requested.First, with regard to the 4 and 7 sections, it is very simple: in Berlin, for the big package of the 2000 agenda, we created a special section, the famous section 7, for the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, and only for these countries.Malta, Cyprus and Turkey have not yet been planned.Our colleague Schroedter described this as a lack of consistency.You may have to ask the president of the council of the time, who is not far from you, madam, how we arrived at this so-called lack of consistency.I also participated a little.I do not believe it, but this decision was motivated by the fact that one wanted a particular instrument for the states of central and eastern Europe, which do not know the same conditions as Cyprus and Malta in the adhesion process.I said that I understood the arguments put forward here and the commission will strive to take into account these wishes, but, as it is the 2000 agenda and financial prospects, we cannot act without modifying these financial prospects.This has obviously not been possible until now.To be clear, if we pass this from section 4 to section 7, there will be no impact on the overall balance of the budget.If we do this, section 7 would increase in proportion to the decrease in section 4. It is impossible to add it to section 7, leaving it as it is section 4. Parliament cannot spend money that it does not have, unless you have a press in the cellar to be able to print tickets in euros!Regarding the peace process now in Cyprus and the link with membership negotiations, I would like to repeat that membership negotiations have always had a direct relationship with this.The Commission and the Council have always endeavored to hire the two Cypriot communities on common projects.As you know, it has not succeeded until now and I am asked if there are premises.	fr
But even fifty years later, we fail to prevent genocide.Therefore, far more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention must be used.The monitoring of weapons trade and better control of the media are of essential importance.Human rights policy is also too selective.The months of NATO bombing in Kosovo and the mediation efforts in the Middle East are in a sharp contradiction to the indifference of the international community towards the conflicts in Africa.I cannot defend myself with the impression that Africa, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, on the agenda of the Portuguese presidency, is not at the top.I deeply regret that.It is not without reason that the Africans have the impression that they are inferior earthlings.I would like to warn of the standards of the human rights situation in Africa, in which people are regarded as something inevitable in the assessment of the human rights situation in Africa.Human rights policy is above all shattered.We succeed within the international community and also in Europe to define a common strategy.Let's take the Sudan, for example.The international community sends contradictory signals to the country.Great Britain opens its message again in Khartum.Canada invites the Sudanes to peace talks.Europe urges the rebels in the south to negotiate, and at the same time the Americans areolating the regime and supporting the rebels militarily.More coordination is required, more information exchange and a more coherent procedure in which each is avoided.Only then can we consistently follow the founders of the general explanation of human rights.Mr President, if we could solve problems with words, we could pack all of our things and go home.Unfortunately, even at the moment we speak in the protected room of this house, human rights are violated all over the world.Sometimes we hear the more the more we speak - applications: words;Contracts: words;Conventions: Words -If we are not careful, the words will take the place of real measures.Words in comprehensive and liberating documents become contracts and conventions that are often presented as evidence of respect and compliance with human rights in a country.Words alone, spoken, written or signed, are not enough.Let us take a look at the signatories of the Convention on Human Rights and the Treatment of Minorities, and then we compare how such minorities, groups or individuals are treated.The result is shabby and shameful.Can someone say with conviction that women are treated fairly and equally that children have human rights that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, faith, gender, disability, their age, their sexual orientation, their opinion, political conviction, etc.?Discrimination is reinforced by the defamation of minorities in the press and other media.Even in the EU, citizens are still exposed to human rights violations, and here too it is violated by our conventions.Every day, false information and false interpretations are used in the press to withhold certain minorities from the law and disparage ethnic minorities.It can be said openly that a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	de
President!First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Solana for this March 1st, where several structures came into force that are related to the European security and defense policy.However, I wonder how he himself is.There is talk of good cooperation with the high representative in the documents.You have just said that you spoke to you at lunch, yes, it should be added that you have not spoken to you and that there are no good cooperation between you and the new structures.But do you not suffer from the fact that you do not conduct the chair there and do not form the focus yourself?I - and I still think some people here in parliament - would welcome it if they were the engine of this matter and did not run the risk of being pushed a little off.The high representative, Mr. Solana, and Commissioner Patten, have tried to demolish a demarcation between the EU's defense policy and that of NATO in the past few months.One actually has the impression that both consider the Petersberg tasks to be suitable to be permanently included in an EU defense policy.The contracts also indicate this direction, but also leave even more scope towards a more general defense policy, which is more likely to coincide with the old statements about the integration of our politics into a European pillar.We would then comment on this European pillar in NATO.I actually hear less and less about it.I have the impression that the European Union has limited its ambitions to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr. Patten then responsible for civil affairs, including the quick-to-use units of police officers and civil servants, about whom he was entirely enthusiastic about the military means and the commitment of the military.Both, and I take it for granted, of course work excellently.But doesn't a little more happen now?Isn't something going on now that one says: In defense policy, NATO's role in the collective defense is very highly emphasized?The European pillar, yes, it actually no longer works as such.Europe is limited to the Petersberg tasks.Is it in our intention, to proceed?In addition, there is talk of the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union, but no longer about Article V, in which one is of course directly involved.Then it is about the larger defense tasks and not just Petersberg.Will that be deleted?At the same time, there is also a generally talk of an increase in defense households.I think that's right, but in this plea is not strictly differentiated between Petersberg tasks and larger collective defense tasks.I wonder how things develop.In the end, how do the two gentlemen see that?Do you have to pay more attention to this topic at the government conferences, or can this be resulted in the contracts?I welcome the fact that an opening arose here with regard to defense policy.	de
This provides a protective measure to ensure that the necessary resources will continue to be available. Mr President, I believe that we must fully agree with Mrs Attwooll's finding at the beginning of her excellent report, that these two proposals of the committee, aiming to get to know the scientific and socio -economic state of the fishing sector, come at a critical time. The exhaustive collection of data proposed and their proper processing will be valuable elements for the more accurate approach to the revision of common fishing policy. All this - clearly - since the items are finally collected. Because, as our rapporteur also notes very aptly, the Commission's proposal contains no compulsory element in terms of Member States. The shipment or not of the data is on a completely voluntary basis, and their non -submission will only mean that there will be no specific financial reward that is not particularly high. With the experience we have in presenting data in the fishing sector - and rely on reports on the fulfillment of perennial orientation programs - I believe we will be faced, instead of a complete picture of the status of the sector, with a panorama of confusion, where some Member States will give e.g. Scientific evidence, but not in terms of employment, while other Member States will give it to employment, but not in terms of resources, depending on whether they can - or want - to collect and transfer them. And, of course, I am very afraid that there will be states that will prefer not to secure funding if they can continue to hide their mismanagement, which we have seen, and even in cases where the mission of these data was mandatory, as in the aforementioned case of the perennial programs. Given this lack - which I think is the most important - the Fisheries Committee report improves the proposal at some interesting points, mainly with the rapporteur's suggestions on more rational deadlines and the request for monitoring by a committee. On the part of my team, we included what I think are two reasonable requests. The first, for a series of data whose collection in some cases could constitute an endless process, serve the studies and samples; the second, to be eliminated from the committee's proposal strictly referring to the taxation of the companies, taking into account, above all, that these tax evidence is not in place. On the basis of all this, I believe that the report is very correct and I ask, on behalf of my team, its approval. I first would like to congratulate Mrs Attwool on the training and presentation of her report. I express my satisfaction with the establishment of a Community framework for the collection and management of fisheries data that I believe is absolutely necessary for the proper assessment of the level of stocks of various species of fish. It is important that the data is both biological and economic and the information provided by the Member States must be standardized throughout the community. Also, such information and information, as mentioned by the rapporteur in its report, must comply with the international provisions.	el
Besides, for many reasons, our views can only be positive. As we have been able to say in Skopje, the former Republic of Yugoslavia in our macedonic roles, in the economic field, in the field of democratic progress, and the issue of multinational cultures together, which is quite difficult and controversial in the Balkans' progress;On the other hand, the price that has had to be paid there due to the nearby war of Kosovo is high, both due to the maintenance of both NATO forces and the reduction in exports to Northern Europe. Mr President, I conclude my speech by confirming that these advances are undoubtedly difficult, fragile, and require continuous control over the various stages of us, one that is sequenced with concentrated and accurate inspections. Mr President, Mr Member of the Commission, Dear Colleagues, I am here to bring the warmth and the hope that the European Liberal and Democratic Party group will take the negotiations to be launched with the former Yugoslavia Republic Macedonia. I am very hopeful that, in accordance with the guidelines outlined by the rapporteur of the report, this agreement may extend as soon as possible to other countries, above all Albania, Bosnia and Hertzegovia, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo and as soon as possible. We are convinced that the rapid initiation of these negotiations and their way as possible to the decision is the only way to achieve peace in the area of ​​peace that would not automatically be born after the end of the Kosovo War and would thus avoid the emergence of a new disintegration, as well as return to confusion and violence and the consequences of all, if not even the world. If maintaining peace and security is the ultimate reason for the current process, with the European Union boldly expanding towards the countries of Eastern Europe, this justification must become even more visible in relations with Albania and the countries of the former Yugoslavia Republic. For this reason, it requires that this kind of parallel expansion to Southeastern Europe is determined and that it is symbolized by the agreements we are currently discussing. In this spirit, almost provocatively, we presented a review to suggest that those who are now in Southeastern Europe to look for external issues would shift to expansion. Southeastern Europe as possible and direct participation in the activities of the European institutions also made us propose to accept a limited number of observers sent to the European Parliament and that the staff of these countries could work in court and commission. However, in order to encourage the development of the area towards a more democratic and stronger economic market society, we are, above all, convinced that it is necessary to take immediate and concrete steps to strengthen the anti -corruption battle, and to enhance international grants for rebuilding and development. For this reason, we submitted some reviews that we hope to accept the Parliament: the first tomer the former Republic of Yugoslavia Macedonia should be offered a zero percentage tariff for all its European Union exports, and compensation for the gradual deductible customs rights that Macedonia applied to European productsCustoms control;Secondly, the former Republic of Yugoslavia Macedonia must be encouraged to gradually connect its currencies to the euro through proper financial support, which would be the first step in the entire Macedonian economy towards Europeanization, and the other purpose would be to eliminate all possible corruption from the banking system;Thirdly, with the support and the assistance that the world is given to the area, and thus to the Macedonia, there must be a clear multilateral nature, without imposing a grant from the obligations of the grant provider. Mr President, Good Colleagues, Member of the Commission, we hope that this agreement can achieve all pre-set goals, but we cannot live in the illusion that in Southeast Europe, peace, stability and well-being can be achieved without having to face much more broad problems that we strive to remove the Code ofAnd why not the new debate about the relationship between the European Union, NATO and the UN in the light of a new balance, a balance that needs to be found between humanitarian intervention and state sovereignty, which I believe will change the entire UN Charter.	fi
In addition to an economic and employment policy, the policy of the European Union also includes a social policy.So far, it has been restrictive both in the approach and the instruments.However, the influence of freedom of movement, the internal market and the euro also leads to integration with labor markets.There are no unmistakable consequences for social protection, which is based on work.Cross -border commuters, parked workers, migrant workers, but also job seekers, interns and students feel prevented from exercising their right to freedom of movement because there are no coordination or convergence at the level of social protection.Incidentally, a similar phenomenon is shown in the tax law area.To combat conflicts of competition and to avoid dumping, the Commission has developed a balanced strategy that finds the middle ground between harmonizing on the one hand and non -interference on the other.On the one hand, there are binding and enforceable guidelines for the same wages or for additional pensions, on the other hand, programs are to create incentives in the fight against discrimination and social exclusion.With a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has come closer to the alignment, in particular with the objectives specified by it and the establishment of a high -ranking civil servant group.Since both proposals have already been approved by the Council, it is important to contribute this approach in order to then be able to assess with expertise whether, to what extent and how social protection must be adjusted in the European Union.Because expansion, globalization, aging of the population, individualization and new family structures require such an alignment.If we deny these relocations, then we will in fact reveal social protection.In the direction of the euroskeptic and nationalists, I say that social security is not social only within the limits of the Member State and does not offer any protection.For competitive reasons, dismantling social protection also harms social protection as a productive factor.Less social protection means lower purchasing power, deterioration in the state of health of employees and less happy workers.I would like to tell the super Europeans that European social protection is neither feasible nor desirable.Member States differ considerably from each other in relation to funds, beneficiaries, income or benefits, etc.This means that leveling is impossible.The path taken by the Commission is understandable.It is an advantage for them that they can create clarity, record data and exchange experiences in order to agree in further objectives, to create solid comparative standards and to give recommendations.I welcome this view.I would like to encourage the commission in it and hope that we will get one step in this point in Lisbon.Mr President, I would like to join the congratulations of my previous speakers for Mr. Andersson for his successful report.He succeeded in making a broad consensus on a topic on behalf of Parliament on behalf of the parliament, which is not only in this parliament, but practically in every Member State a problem that is sensitive in every relationship.I also welcome the Commission to notify.We had to wait a long time, but the waiting was worth it.It could develop into a milestone in the development of a European system of social security, provided that we take it seriously and do not allow that individual Member States shy away from the steps to be moved.	de
"Even the cumulation of funds from the cohesion fund and the structural fund has not brought the desired success in all regions and countries.After the declared goal of all politicians is the reduction in unemployment across Europe, one has to ask the critical question of whether applied politics is the right one or whether it is not more functional to strengthen the competitiveness of the regions through corresponding measures such as increased promotion of research and development, improvement in infrastructure, increasing the level of training levels?The building blocks of a successful business location are serious structural reforms and a competitive tax and tax policy.If we do not want to put up with the accusation to pursue a cost -intensive structural policy that is not sustainable in the question of employment, the previous measures must be questioned.The Union's structural policy is successful if it succeeds in creating sufficient jobs and the unemployment rate drops significantly.President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues!My thanks go to the rapporteur to treat this very important topic.After all, the development of the social and economic situation is crucial for how the citizens of Europe evaluate the success of our work.For the EU's credibility, the problems with which people have to deal with every day are of crucial importance.We have to admit that the EU has already supported the development of the poorer countries - in my opinion very generously.When I keep in mind what it looked like in Portugal and Greece when I traveled these countries for the first time 25 years ago, then I take my hat off to the EU or, as the French say: ""Coup de Chapeau"".The EU really deserves this respect.In the countries themselves, however, there are still too big differences between poor and rich regions.What are the consequences?People react by voting their feet and leaving their homeland.For example, we have to build schools, hospitals and the entire infrastructure several times for the same people in the same country.This is a very expensive matter and also leads to major social problems.However, most people would like to stay where they were born if they were given the opportunity to do so, i.e. if they had work.We have to give you this option.It is about a moral duty that is imposed on the EU and all of us.I see a solution in a noticeable promotion of entrepreneurship.I not only understand to own a company, but the will to run a company.I mean an attitude that prompted people to find their way in his life, be it as an employee, entrepreneur or civil servant.What does a just society look like?It is a society in which a person can also progress from modest conditions so that his children have a little easier.This also results in the possibility of a positive development of the regions, because people are involved and work when the conditions are created.In conclusion, I would like to point out that in this relationship we should learn from America, where hard work is still fashionable and success is proof of competence and does not become the subject of envy, as is often the case with us in Europe."	de
I want to hear your position, Mr. Commissioner: Do you intend to take some measures for the economic, ecological and cultural restoration of the affected areas? Mr President, a honorable MP, first of all you know that my colleague Mr Wallstrfm visited Romania and Hungary herself and personally shaped a picture of the extent of the disaster. He also agreed with the relevant ministers of these countries to create a business unit that would deal with these issues. The main issues that this International Operational Unit will deal with have already been defined. On the issue of funding, the Commission is considering which resources it can provide for immediate assistance. Beyond that, the Phare program and the ISPA program, the financial means for the pre -accessible strengthening of prospective countries, are of course available. This is also the question that needs to be answered in cooperation with the affected countries, that is, in what measure can funds from these two funds can be made.. I am convinced, Mr Commissioner, that the budget committee will read these information with great satisfaction when you provide it. Question No.43 of K. (H-0242/00): Subject: Concerns about the Kozlondui Nuclear Security Memorandum in Bulgaria despite the positive step that was signed by the Memorandum between the Commission and Bulgaria for the Nuclear SecurityProcedure for the decommissioning of Kozlondui's four precarious reactors, as this process is not identified with the position of the European Union as well as with the commitments made by Bulgaria under the agreement it has entered into with the Nuclear Security Account. What decisions were made on the final closure of units 1 and 2 before the end of 2002 and what steps were taken to conclude an agreement so that the final decommissioning of units 3 and 4 would take place earlier in 2006, as required by the agreed memorandum? Will the Commission use the capabilities and means available in the framework of the corporate relationship for the final closure of units 1 to 4 of Kozlodui and in what way? Is it a prerequisite for the granting of financial assistance to Bulgaria, the definition of reactors 3 and 4 reactors, as the European Commission President, Professor Prodi, says in the letter on 17 February? What are the results of the meeting on February 4 between the Commission and the Bulgarian authorities and in what direction does the Mixed Working Group work? Second part Mr. Commissioner, thanks for your answer. But I have a lot of questions because in your hearing before the Parliament's Environment Committee, but still today, you have talked about the shortest possible cessation of nuclear reactors who, as we know, are extremely dangerous. And not only those, but also those in Slovakia, and those in Lithuania. Of course, I understand that there are some difficulties to close immediately, but is this the shortest possible time? I have a question because, while you came up with a specific date for reactors 1 and 2 and say that they will close before the end of 2002 which I think this is a long time, because you do not forget that we are afraid of not having an accident from any of them,Situations are very dangerous what is preventing you from defining today when the 3 and 4 reactors will close and why do you go until 2006 and maybe then tell us later?	el
The impending beginning of the stabilization and association negotiations is the most important example of our good relationship. It is also the cooperation of the former Republic of Yugoslavia Macedonia in the reconstruction of Kosovo. I am grateful to the Macedonian authorities for their assistance in Kosovo in Kosovo in recent weeks to eliminate major problems in power distribution. Like dignified members, I also recognize this country's stabilizing role in the tragedy of the Balkans, especially in the integration of the Albanian minority into the political and social life of the country. I met the newly elected President Georgievski a few weeks ago, and like others, I was extremely impressed with his commitment to promote multinational and pluralism. You allow me to outline the current situation in these negotiations, of which - as Lagndijk stated - other countries in the area are very interested. On January 24, this year, the Council approved the guidelines for negotiations on the Macedonia Macedonia Republic of Yugoslavia. This is the most important step in the Western Balkan region's stabilization and association process, which the Commission may have begun in May 1999. You allow me to clarify the most important elements of these design lines. They cover the incorporation of arrangements for the former Yugoslav Republic with Macedonia in the agreement. They cover better regional cooperation provisions, including a plan for the creation of free trade areas between the region, although I have to make it clear that it is by no means a company to recreate the State of Yugoslavia. They cover the plan to introduce the free trade area between the European Union and these areas within ten years of the entry into force of the agreement. They cover employees' free mobility, right of residence, freedom of provision of services, running fees and capital free mobility. They cover the commitment of the former Yugoslavia Republic Macedonia closer to its legislation to comply with European Community legislation, especially in the key areas of the internal market;And they cover the provisions of the former Republic of Yugoslavia in many different fields, including in the field of legal and internal matters. We are currently making preparations for the Commission to start negotiations in March. My intention is to visit the former Republic of Yugoslavia in Macedonia in the second week of March. I hope that I can then start this process, though the official negotiations will begin very soon afterwards. During this visit, I will also improve our representation in the former Republic of Yugoslavia in Macedonia, as well as valuable members and others have urged to do. The negotiations are scheduled to end in December this year, but this will largely depend on the mood and determination of the negotiators. The agreement could enter into force three or four years later from this day, as the time needed by Member States' parliamentaries to ratify the agreement. I would like to comment very briefly on a few other points in the draft resolution. We accept that the agreement should, to a certain extent, be an example for other such agreements, but we certainly want to consider the fact that it is different countries, each with their own identity and concerns. I agree with the extensive view that we should look at each country according to its own merits and not connect everyone to the pace of the country that progresses in the Union relationship with the most slowly. It has never been a purpose. The first to start negotiations with the former Yugoslavia Republic Macedonia, above all other countries, is an indication that we can act and also act differentiated. As regards the provision of regional assistance mentioned in the report, we agree that we should provide technical and financial support for projects with a cross -border or regional dimension. We agree that the stabilization and association agreement must include an assessment clause on the possibility of becoming a member of the EU. It reflects the European Union's position on its Western Balkan relationships, as stated in the conclusions of the Cologne European Council. We strongly agree with the need to diversify our support programs as widely as possible.	fi
He has worked out some interesting perspectives that I would like to do in some points a little further.It seems extremely important to me to think about the area of ​​application of the regulation.First of all, a stronger focus of the projects on the restoration of the tropical forests is required.The 1995 Council Ordinance was perhaps too concentrated on the protection of the tropical forests and did not deal with the use of their production potential.In addition, all aspects of sustainable forestry must be included in future community actions.This means that the local population dependent on the forest ecosystems must be taken into account.It should not be overlooked that the necessary active participation of these people in need of support is met with great obstacles: the corresponding forest areas are often impaired by unrest and conflicts as well as the negative effects of tourism, which is all too often presented as a miracle solution, and if they exist, if they exist.Although any production activity is set in some forests, there are also those that continue to fulfill economic functions.This applies to our forests in the European Union, and I ask you, dear colleagues, what community aid was done for our European forests destroyed by the storms in December last year?The goals of the present report are undoubtedly supported, but a real community policy is also required to maintain and sustainable forests..(En) I probably do not have to emphasize how important the tropical forests are for our earth, how great their influence on the climate is, that a large part of the world's biodiversity in these forests is native and what importance they have, for example as a firewood source, for the life of millions of people in developing countries.For these and other reasons, the European citizens rightly expect the community to support measures to maintain and sustainable the tropical forests.Although I speak of tropical forests, however, it is new to this regulation that the scope of the scope of the previous regulation has been extended to all developing countries, so that countries such as South Africa and China as well as the Mediterranean states and the regions of the Middle East are now also included.In the regulation, the regulation explicitly indicates the needs of local communities and the population dependent on the forest ecosystem and the need to take into account gender -specific considerations.We spoke about the environmental regulation earlier, with regard to a number of horizontal questions, my statements also apply to the prescription of measures to promote the preservation and sustainable management of tropical and other forests in developing countries.I will therefore only go into this regulation briefly.With regard to the amendments listed in the report by Mr. Fernández Martín, the Commission represents the following view of the most important horizontal questions.Financial reference amount: The Commission approves the compromise amount of EUR 249 million mentioned in amendment 9 for the period of seven years.Comitology: In principle, the Commission supports change application, but prefers the formulation of change applications 13, 14 and 15. In the amendments, the amendments are proposed that the annual guidelines and priorities are to be adopted in the administrative procedure, while the Council should examine individual measures with a scope of more than EUR 2 million by means of the advisory procedure.	de
The refusal of the Parliament to grant the discharge and the final refusal of the 1996 budget, the motion of censorship presented in Parliament last year for various reasons and the first report of the Committee of independent experts on the reform of the Commission which aroused the resignation in the block of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.Those of us who took part in this historic event know very well that there would have been no upheaval if the parliament had not used its power to put pressure on the commission so that it changes its mode of operation.Remember: the Council of Ministers, which is still absent from this debate this evening, approved the discharge for the 1997 and not 1996 fiscal year the same day of the Commission's resignation on March 15.Here is now the second report of the independent expert committee, which we have already had the opportunity to congratulate ourselves and to debate briefly last September.Our greatest concern, at the PPE, is to regain the confidence of opinion.Not all additional in the direction of building a strong Europe will be useless if European peoples have the impression that the democratic system of responsibility is not appropriate for too zealous officials.We will not give in ground under any pretext, land that we have conquered in recent months and which, in our view, acts in the interest of opening and transparency.We are therefore worried about seeing the burst of announcements from the Commission that Commissioner Kinnock has launched in recent weeks, suggesting to put the policy proposals of different types in a white paper.If it shows a wish to act quickly, it also gives the impression that the commission is more in transmission mode than listening.Our concern will be reinforced if the rumor of recent days is correct, namely, that the Commission intends to seriously limit the access of the Parliament to information.This question was, after all, one of the causes of the fall of the previous commission.Haven't we learned the lessons?Knowing that the European Parliament and the European Commission must still negotiate framework relations has aroused our disagreement with the rapporteur when we discussed his report in committee.We could in no way agree with him when he says that it would be humiliating that parliament gives detailed instructions on what he wants in the commission's package of reforms.The less we will be precise in our resolutions, Mr. Van Hulten, the more the commission and your former colleagues on the board will have the opportunity to do what they want.We believe that the many recommendations for the Sages' report should be applied.The PPE-DE-DE Group submitted all the recommendations of the Sages Report in Commission and many of them are now in the report, which has completely changed the nature of the Van Hulten report in committee.We once again proposed a few amendments which had fallen into a committee, in particular, our wish of a revision of the codes of conduct, in particular with a view to including the reference to the merit and the management capacity that you, Mr. Commissioner, agreed to include during the hearings last September in these codes of driving, in particular in the context of appointments and promotions.	fr
"Mr. MP, there is a very large dimension of views on the degree of danger of reactors 3 and 4. To my great surprise, after the signing of the agreement with Bulgaria it has been publicly criticized by me, because this agreement is very cruel to Bulgaria, and it is not too hard for Bulgaria. I can believe whoever I want. But I trust the estimates made at the beginning and I insist that the principle of which we have to work here is to prevent the risk. But I should also ask you to consider that the choice of using nuclear energy is an independent decision of each country. Neither the Commission, nor the Council or Parliament, have the potential to ban any country in the world from using nuclear power and to force it to immediately stop the operation of any reactor. All that can be done is to agree on a package, as with Lithuania and Slovakia, and recently with Bulgaria, which will allow the country to tackle economic and social impacts as well as the impacts of reactors on infrastructure. Everyone has to decide how he will succeed in interpreting the targets as quickly as possible. All I can tell you, on the basis of the negotiations that he in part, is that these were what we could achieve. If we had tried to achieve more we would not have reached an agreement and we would have no dates to stop the reactors. You are constantly facing the dilemma here either to accept what is possible or to maintain a very rigid attitude, which will eventually reassure your environmental consciousness, but you have achieved nothing. I find that the result is particularly good, especially for Bulgaria, given the extremely difficult situation there. I will tell you something else that is a little confused, but you will understand immediately after the reason. The text states that the decision on the cessation dates of units 3 and 4 will be taken in 2002, so much later than the date we were looking for. The text also states that the Commission means that this period of cessation will be at the latest - be careful, at the latest - in 2006. The fact that the Bulgarian government signed the agreement without questioning the position of the Commission is of a certain political significance. I can't say more, but I think you understand what this implies. Questions to Mr. Lamy Question No.44 of K.

"Opinion of a deputy for southern Europe: ""Nevertheless, that is, competitiveness and equality of conditions"".(End of fiction).The deputy who now explains his vote considers positive that there is a community directive on water, but he believes that with environmental dogmatisms we do not build Europe, we do a legislative caricature.We cannot deal in the same way of the countries affected by floods and by drought, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries subject to a northern rainfall regime.In a completely different order of things, Europe would be not united if in the future it made water transfers impossible between different basins.Once again, we must remember that we are involved in a continental project in Political Union.Drinking, feeding, washing, cultivating ....: water irrigates each act of our daily life.Water wrongly considered an unalterable and inexhaustible resource.Because a gesture as simple as opening a tap seems to flow from source.But the source threatens to dry up .... all scientific studies are now formal: water will constitute the essential issue in the coming years, tomorrow.But tomorrow it will be too late.It is time today to clarify the rules of the game, before being all losers.By adopting the water directive on Wednesday, February 15, the European Parliament affirms its ambition to protect surface waters, coastal waters, indoor waters and groundwater.Europe now has a framework to prevent any deterioration in water quality, promote its sustainable use, protect ecosystems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate discharges from dangerous substances.It is a rescue buoy launched in water.It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water.Indeed, the ecological catastrophe that rages on the banks of the Danube reminds us, if necessary, that too often human negligence leads to jeopardizing natural resources, such as water.The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates from 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation characterizing the legislation on water and surface waters, coastal waters, interior waters and groundwater.It provides a framework to prevent any additional deterioration, to protect ecosystems, to promote a sustainable use of water, to help fight floods and droughts and to gradually eliminate discharges from dangerous substances.Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.The procedure relating to the development of this text was long.The proposal for a directive was modified twice, a second time in 1997, a second time in 1998. A technical working group made up of representatives of the Council and Parliament gathered in January 1999 to try to bring the positions of our two institutions closer.However, the amendments deposited by the Environment Commission remain numerous.I support most of them.With regard to the calendar and the objectives, the Council provides that the objective of achieving a good state of surface water is carried out no later than 16 years after the entry into force of the directive, the Commission of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this period to be reduced to 10 years."	fr
"The report does not say - but it will have to do it in the future - that the governments of the last forty years of all the Member States have squandered and wasted the capital that the workers had entrusted to them to pay their pensions.Today, the boxes are empty.You have to change the whole system!These governments must resign because they deserve the confidence of anyone, nor elderly people or young people today, nor retirees of 2100, 2200, etc..I will start first by warmly congratulating the rapporteur for the audacity of his proposals!I will continue by deploring the reluctance of the right of this European Parliament which, by adopting a whole series of amendments, emptied my colleague's work!This report is, I recall, based on the committee's annual economic report for 1999, the first published under the Euro regime.It therefore relates to the unified European economy rather than a series of national economies.It was for the European Parliament to seize this opportunity to make imaginative and ""activist"" proposals, to use the adjective used by the rapporteur, in order to give a new orientation to the economic activities of the European Union.Indeed, an observation is essential: Europe has an incomparable potential of economic and social progress which, for reasons which still escape us in part, remains largely unexploited, from which the very interesting suggestions contained in the initial report of the economic and monetary commission to relaunch economic activity by setting ambitious objectives (employment rate of 75 %, recovery of growth ...) and!The initial proposals invited in particular the Council to arrest measures aimed at ensuring full employment while remaining coherent with the stability of prices and the budgetary balance of the entire economic cycle.It is not indeed, as some tend to make it believe, to question the policy of stability adopted in recent years.Measures, in particular tax, encouraging private and public investment, must be adopted.It is necessary to hand over the tranceuropée network program as it was proposed in 1994, launching a large research and development program to give investments the necessary content in terms of innovation.How can we consider that the investment should not serve as a demand management instrument but be made according to its own merits?We must promote better management of working time and the generalization of good practice policies in the Member States in order to increase the degree of employability, especially among the most disadvantaged strata of the active population.Certain measures such as requalification, in the form of lifelong training, prove to be particularly relevant.They should be an integral part of the permanent institutional transformation which will have to support the transition to a knowledge -based economy."	fr
On the other hand, there are also community guidelines, but they are not used or only used to a small extent because there are not enough national inspectors.This must be remedied urgently.A guideline for security in maritime traffic has been in preparation for many years, but it is progressing very slowly.In this regard, an unacceptable immobility and unacceptable inactivity on the part of the Commission can be determined.The date for the submission of the Commission on this essential question, which has been pushed out and is now scheduled for July, must be preferred.The basic provisions must be particularly clear and strict.Let me name only three aspects that our faction considers primarily.First, the responsibility of the freight owners must be clearly determined in the event of oil charges, so that the victims of pollution can be unambiguously asserted.The best precaution for the future is the certainty for the agitation that they will be held responsible for civil, criminal law and financially if they are not extremely vigilant with regard to the safety of the ships they selected.Second, the condition that oil tankers, which are approved for traffic in the community waters, must have a double outer skin, as soon as possible and must not be postponed to Saint Neverse Day.Thirdly, an age limit for the ships that are approved for traffic in the community waters must be determined immediately.It could be at a maximum of 15 years.If it is not possible to say goodbye to a common regulatory framework that is sufficiently clear, strict and consistent, the member states who want to create their own framework of this kind should be justified in order to protect their population and territory, as well as the United States understood the teachings from the disaster of the Exxon Valdez by asking for double outer skin and the older than 20 yearsare, don't let it go into your waters.That is why the United States had prohibited Erika's driving on its waters.If the community had done the same, a huge disaster would have been avoided.This time, let us really draw the teachings from it, Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, even if the emotions of the media and parliament have subsided again.Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, all these names wake up ominous memories.And now Erika.Which tanker is the next?Twenty -one years after the Amoco Cadiz, this Xest oil spill, the seventh since 1967, proves the irresponsibility of our respective government.Once again our west coast on the Atlantic pays the high price for its inability to react, for their surrender before the multis.It is difficult to understand why the French and Europeans allow what the Americans prohibit, and why Europe, where you are usually so quickly on hand with environmental laws, has left the security of maritime traffic outside.Now we have the result.The Erika, a ship under Maltese flag, a floating wreck that is one of the most dangerous tankers, has contaminated our coasts on more than 400 km, a pollution that is much stronger than in the case of the Amoco Cadiz.As a member of the Loire-Atlantique region, I can unfortunately testify.	de
"At the moment, he has just led to the socialist group because he returns to a decision that was taken extremely clearly at the conference of presidents.However, he does the same thing.We discussed, we were unanimous except the PPE group and the Liberal group and I even pointed out, you will remember my dear colleagues presidents, that the question is not to know if you are for or against the Tobin tax, but to know if you dare to hear what the Commission and the Council think.It is not to ask much.So, I reiterate the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and to the Council to know once and for all the position of these two bodies in relation to this relatively modest proposal, but which would give an important signal to opinion, in particular after the emotion aroused by the failure of the Seattle Conference.We will vote on the request of the PPE-DE Group aimed at withdrawing the oral question concerning the tax on the capital of the agenda.(Parliament rejects the request with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions) Madam president, I would like to thank Mr. Poettering for the advertising that he has just given this debate.THANKS.Madam President, did we count my vote, which could not be made electronically because I do not have my card?I voted ""for"".Indeed, if we add the two colleagues who came out, we obtain as a result .... Madam President, the Presidency proclaimed the result of the vote.The changes do not have to be.Madam President, during the last vote and I rely on your decision on this subject - on the question of the committee's strategic plan, I pointed out that I was asking for the floor before the vote on behalf of my group.But my request was not satisfied.I will be grateful to you, at the end of this point of the agenda, to allow me to provide an explanation of voting in the name of my group.It is important.It would be useful to record at the report of Parliament the way in which people perceive what we have just done, in the light of their own political analysis.Madam President, I do not want to relaunch the debate but I also asked to speak to express myself as to the request of Mr. Barón Crespo.Me either, you did not give me the floor.I deplore it but the vote was made, the decision fell and we should therefore stop there.I am sorry, Mr. Hänsch and Mr. Cox, I had not seen that you are asking for the floor.However, I believe that the positions are clear and they will be recorded at the minutes.When we will adopt the minutes of today's session tomorrow, colleagues who estimate that the positions have not been well explained may request modifications."	fr
Ms. Palacio spoke in detail about this problem, and I think she immediately launched with a proposal for a guideline to transport dangerous goods, which is absolutely necessary today, namely the approach for a European livelihood.In this regard, it will be able to determine that France is willing to work for regulations during his presidency that contribute to greater security.But after the ecological shock, the economic shock, which numerous colleagues have already discussed here.The shell breeding, fishing, the oyster breeding, fish farming are seriously affected today.Storm damage has also been added to the oil spill in many places.Unfortunately, these branches of employment have been exceptionally damaged.On the one hand, you have to fix the damage and, on the other hand, - which is perhaps even more difficult - regain the trust of customers.In view of this situation, people in Brittany - in the Departments Vendée and Charente - as well as the forest companies in other areas await a sign of the European Union.We cannot at the same time want to put this legislative period under the sign of the rapprochement with the citizens and, given the disasters of this kind, passive and without a concrete answer.I have the words of Commissioner Fischler, who may be the most specific we have heard to this day.There are undoubtedly numerous comments on compassion, solidarity and announcements, but today it is time that a concrete sign of European solidarity follows the waiting.The oil spill due to the Erika shipwreck is only a case in a long series of disasters in the waters of the community in recent years, including oil pollution from Braer ahead of Scotland and the Sea Empress in front of the Shetland Islands.These dirt not only led to irreparable ecological damage, they also had devastating effects on the local industries.The accident of the Erika has severely damaged the local fishing and aquaculture sector, and in addition to the damage visible today, the long-term consequences of oil pollution must not be neglected.There must be effective compensation.The security regulations of the community in shipping must be tightened, there must be greater controls, and driving under cheap flags, which can also be observed in the fishing sector, must also be stopped.The ship owners and the owners of the cargo are responsible and must be held accountable for their negligence.The existing compensation funds are insufficiently equipped, as the case of Braer's accident makes it clear, in which the fishing sector of the Shetland Islands was not sufficiently compensated for its losses.We have to learn from the past and ensure that the sectors damaged by the oil spest of the Erika can be rebuilt.Mr President, it is necessary that today, two and a half months after the accident of the Erika, we will again deal with this catastrophe because their dramatic consequences have not yet been overcome.We have to maintain the pressure in connection with the organized people today so that the damage caused as a result of all the damage caused as a result of his rampant aspiration, and at the same time act determined so that such disasters do not repeat themselves.	de
The amendment no.4 is a bit of the same spirit. At this particular point, we might be able to give Mr Bourlanges more satisfaction. We have already spoken to the Council in order to include in his decision a statement by the Commission that adopts this element of heresy. It is precisely what we propose is, in terms of the second contribution, the exact amount and the time the position of the second section will be decided to decide, taking into account the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contribution of other bilateral sponsors. In other words, we do not set prerequisites, or we consider it more effective not to put prerequisites from the first moment, and nevertheless, we put in terms of the possible release of the second section. With this, we would not have problems in order to act immediately, we would not create problems in the population of Kosovo, but on the other hand, we would force the other aid sponsors to complete their financial efforts the same as we do. A third problem was raised by Mrs Dhrkop on many years of programs. It is recalled that the plans are on a perennial basis. The programs should obviously take into account the annual budget contributions. Finally, I would make some comments about the desire for additional information that expresses us. On the one hand, we were asked to facilitate the bidding process in Parliament and in this sense, I could say that the Commission had already had the opportunity to make available to the Parliament's budget committee last week the last payment situation since the operational team was set up in Kosovo. The Commission may be committed to keeping parliament up -to -date on regular intervals on the competitions announced. Our desire is to also be registered on the Internet so that there is maximum transparency with regard to that point. A second point I would like to comment on is the rest of the information, which can be important to parliament, about fulfilling macroeconomic assistance. In this sense, I also announce to you that the Commission is willing to keep the Presidents of the various parliamentary committees involved in this matter at regular intervals and on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information being transferred, as well as the various plans for implementation for the implementation of the Multi -Economic Functions, requires this. Thank you very much, gentlemen, and I hope, with the final decision of the Council, to be able to release these resources and complete a positive contribution that allows us to continue the significant effort made in Kosovo in terms of both the more and for the most part of this,Mr President, I am glad for the convergence of views between Parliament, in particular the budget committee and the committee and we assure you that, for our part, we will always be faithful to the appointment to help the Commission complete its work.	el
Dear colleague, I am able to tell you that the bureau has first decided to publish the Protocol of the MPs' financial interests on the internet, and the deals are very careful about the problems, the legal issues related to it. But soon we will have a decision.(Summary Practices Approved) Restructuring of the Commission The daily provision provides for the Commission's announcement on the restructuring of the European Commission. I immediately give the floor to President Romano Prodi. Thanks Mr. Commissioner Kinnock. We are now moving into the process of questions - answers. Madam President, among the committee's proposals, is the possibility of removing the immunity of the committee's employees. Recently, the immunity of an old member of the Commission has been lifted, and the case is currently pending before the Brussels court, on the grounds that Brussels is the seat of Community institutions. However, there are other seats of the Community institutions and, moreover, the action of the community extends to the whole of Community territory, that is, there are thousands of jurisdiction that can seek the brought of justice, commissioners, etc. Does the Commission realize that in order to lift immunity, will it be necessary or approval by a new legal body, which will regulate the process of claiming responsibility by the Commission officials, including the former or in active commissioners? There is effective legal prevention. In this particular case in mind the honorable MP, not only the Commission has quickly and quickly ended up with the decision to remove the immunity of a former commissioner, but the former commissioner herself announced to the Commission its desire to remove immunity. I can understand the complications that are concerned about the honorable MP, but I say that during the last five years there have been ten cases of national legal authorities for the removal of the immunity of 26 employees, and there has been a response, and even with the study, in all. I believe that the House may therefore have confidence that not only the individual rights of people who may be accused or has been requested to provide evidence, but the same is true of the interests of the legal bodies of each Member State who seek to receive information, or the right to receive an interview or the right to receive an interview. As a rapporteur for Parliament for the details of your report on staff, I am very warmly welcomed, Mr. Kinnock, the fact that we are now starting the process, and let me tell all colleagues here that we have a very important task to perform, which will be absolutely essential to the future of the Commission. And I will make the observation, before passing my questions, that what is happening to the Commission on the Regulation of Service plays a fundamental role for our responsibility as staff employers, because of the staff of the European Parliament operating under the same conditions. This will be part of the project we need to carry out, and I am sure that all of you today will want to participate in this process. Now there are two points that, with your permission, would like to put to Mr Kinnock.	el
"This is where we get to the other point, namely, to the symbolizing snail of our postal services. There has been development in the last 200 years, and the delivery time of a letter from Munich to Brussels has gradually increased five times. The letters go to Strasbourg a little faster, but far too slow. This means that the quality of services has continued to deteriorate since the time of the Thurn und Taxis. It is true, though, that we have said that we now have new, such as electronic opportunities, such as email, but on the other hand, it is noteworthy that the ordinary letter is still particularly important, and young families, older people and many others are still quite dependent on the usual letter mail. Therefore, I believe that we have to act in a conventional letter of letter in a way that was well described by a colleague Radwan, namely we need to promote competition and define the boundaries on the other. However, we have often done the opposite in recent years! When the mail has been privatized seemingly and in part, as we have done in Germany, the disadvantages of state monopoly are associated with the disadvantages of privatization and is not the actual purpose. There has been talk of the social importance of mail carriers here, and I would also like to add to the social importance of post offices. There has been talk of the countryside and sparsely populated areas. I live in Munich, a very dense population, but the problem is the same there. The mailing agencies of the neighborhoods will be closed one after another. The population of the big cities is older than average, and older people in the big cities are apparently more lonely as the number of shops is reduced at the same time. Therefore, it is also necessary to strengthen certain minimum standards here and to be aware that it is important to guarantee proper care of the citizens. If there is only one mailbox to be emptied in the evening in Munich's central town, it is a rapid deterioration of quality while raising some prices and we need to be aware of this. The liberation may therefore be accepted, but the limits of release must be considered, Europe must be quickly created, and the Commission must provide appropriate research. I wish I would no longer be a symbol of European postal politics in the future, but that the German expression ""Ab Geht Die Post"" (mail passes), which is from the time when the post was still symbol of speed, would eventually be responsible for its original meaning. Like Radwa member, I am pleased that the Commission member is not present today, but a member of the Commission Monti, because I think he can illuminate some of the competition issues for us. I do not know if a member of the Commission is familiar with the judgment of the European Court of Justice last week, February 10, which assesses whether German postal services have a dominant position due to the existence of the postal monopoly. Before moving on to the next release, that is, before 1 January 2003, the competition must undoubtedly be made in this area, as currently the postal services are being skewed due to lower taxis in some countries. This has an impact on free competition between different post offices. If we assume that the release will be carried out throughout the European Union, what effects would it have on free competition? In any case, based on what we know, Sweden is the only country where liberation has been passed through and has led to a 59 % increase in postal prices. Of course, we do not know what happens in those individual countries where the release is carried out. It is expected that the release of postal services will lead to increasing differences between different countries in terms of postal services, which of course has an impact on competition, but not only on the cost of postal services, but also on the location of the institutions. At the moment, for example, there are companies that settle in the Netherlands, as postage is lower there than in Germany, and this may happen in the future."	fi
I believe that at the moment, and in particular in recent months, there has been some positive development for the means that Kouchner can use for effective activities. I remember hearing Kouchner on this topic during the Council of Europe Ministerial Meeting and I think that many of the concerns he then expressed in the lack of solving some problems, and it can be said that he has been given these means. There are two essential issues: first, adding police troops, which was an important factor in ensuring the safety of the civilian population, and in particular in the protection of certain nationality groups, and increasing the funding, which specifically made it possible to maintain some officials in important, administrative and functional tasks in Kosovo. A good member of the Parliament, there is a question that we should all ask - and did it a short time ago in a diplomatic way - and which concerns the consistency of the Security Council resolution 12/99. I know it is an extremely sensitive thing, but we all have to ask about the logic behind this resolution and the possibility of implementing it. We are in favor of its complete implementation: however, we need to look at this resolution - and probably this is one thing that will sooner or later have to do the United Nations Security Council - in terms of what has happened in other strategic areas and scenes in the world. Could they see certain types of methods and certain logic and balance - which otherwise were the kind of logic and balance that caused a resolution - which should or should not be maintained in the future. What we have to do and we are doing for the European Union is to guarantee Kouchner all the means;And a member of the Parliament is right that we have a duty to tell them in front of our citizens regularly and openly to which these means are either used or not used. On behalf of the Council, we are going to provide information on this issue during the Portugal Presidency. Mr President of the Council, I totally agree with you. The problem is not a special representative, but the legal basis of his work, namely, resolution 1244. In my opinion, it is the lack of such a plan that causes or promotes excesses, accidents and murders that a member Alavanos spoke. Is the Council to raise the question of the final position of Kosovo? And if the answer is positive, whether it is planning to do so in the general redefinition of the area by avoiding the multiplication of micro -states, which some tend to seek, and by combining the parties, in this case Kosovo and Albania. Question 7 is left untreated because the questioner is not present. Question 8 (H-0796/99): Subject: New Interreg initiative on the Interreg initiative it has drawn up in the draft information on the promotion of urban, rural and coastal planning of the Interreg initiative in Annex 2 (1) of Annex 2 in Annex 2 in Annex 2 of the Intergear and Coastal Planning. However, the housing sector is explicitly excluded from the strategy. Given that there are many historically valuable residential buildings in rural areas, including small cottages, and taking into account the need for many different reasons to keep the rural areas populated, and to attract more people to the rural areas, would the Council consider to be helped to achieve these goals in areas within the Interreg area? The Mr President, the Council, and I would say, that Portugali, in particular, is very aware of the importance of the problems of the Parliament, and I want to say that we always focus all our attention to the policies of the community's development of rural areas.	fi
Mr President, good rapporteur, good colleagues, before I start talking more about the report on the Equal initiative, I would like to say something about the principle of the employment trends on which the report is based. The report includes the basic objectives of the EU -wide employment policy, including employment, entrepreneurship and adaptability. These goals are apparently intended to make employees as useful as possible for the economy. However, an approach that really wants to eliminate discrimination effectively and long -term is the goal should be people's self -determination. Only then is it no longer just about economic exploitation, but about equal life. However, Member Stenzel's report evolved well, at least in terms of the given guidelines. All asylum seekers and refugees must be specifically included in the programs, although it should be really self -evident. Nevertheless, the conservatives voted against it in the committee. I ask them: Is your policy a goal of marginalizing people? What is the idea behind the fact that people are forbidden to do the job if they want to work? Isn't it in a steep contradiction with the employment direction? It is also worth mentioning that this is a mainstream program, as the report has one shortage. Thus, the point of view has been particularly emphasized that women should get better opportunities in the labor market, and this would happen by building more day care centers. If you do not worry about men's griefly rising career tubes, but only about kindergarten sites, without fighting the uneven distribution of repetition, unfortunately the woman has not understood what Mainstreaming means! Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee approved an opinion on the report on Equal at its last meeting on the Equal Program, with one voting empty. At first, I consciously state this in my speech to make it clear that the situation is the opposite of the corresponding Employment Committee. The position of all groups behind the statement is based on conclusions that focus on the association of regional and transport policy and tourism issues with the aspects of the labor market discrimination and all kinds of inequalities. Of course, members of the Regional Policy Committee will also find several criticisms on the proposal of the Commission, for example, first, for measures related to the development partnerships of insufficient theme sectors;Secondly, strict selection criteria awaiting the drafting of the Commission to evaluate project proposals;Third, the too high administrative costs of the Commission and Technical Aid. Therefore, the upper limit must be set for administrative costs. From these critical remarks, the committee came to a conclusion. We paid special attention to the combination of issues that apply to the creation of new jobs in the social and tourism sectors and small and medium-sized businesses, and in addition to facilitating the establishment of SMEs, taking into account the necessary economic structural change. Coordinating Community initiative activities with European employment initiatives is an important and crucial requirement and a prerequisite for the success of the Equal program. We emphasize an innovative approach to the formation of international development partnerships and organizing experience exchange at European level and as part of the Equal program. A special goal, gaining benefit to Europe as a whole, raises regional cooperation to the European level, maintaining the cooperation of different regional actors. It's a good thing and that is why we have also supported it. Mr President, Ladies and Lords, Good Colleagues, Today, it was already referred to that the first Urban initiative was unequivocally successful. We thank the enthusiastic members of the Parliament, especially as I am a new member of the Parliament, who heard the rapporteur McCarthy, that this initiative is now being continued as Urban II initiative, albeit with less funding, and therefore I would like to be caught up with his stakes and, of course, his initiative of Urban II. New in Urban II is that it was designed for small cities or neighborhoods. This is important because it is small cities that often have worse opportunities to get support. On the other hand, problems that lead to a major need for reform can focus particularly on such cities and have a very negative effect.	fi
Expressing our satisfaction with the rapporteur's excellent work, we only hope that the Commission will take into account the proposals of Parliament, respecting the commitments undertaken under the Code of Conduct for the implementation of structural policies, and that it will confirm with the necessary modifications to thisutilizing relations with neighboring countries. Mr President, this year is about 200 billion euros for structural funds by 2006, but only 5 % is intended for Community initiatives, namely Interreg, Leader, Urban and Equal. This is a reduction of 3 % against earlier Community initiatives. Equal is only € 2.8 billion, as clarified in the balanced report by colleague Ursula Stenzel. This makes us even more wonder about the large number of amendments and the overly long list of desires related to potential tasks. How to put priorities here? There is consensus on the basic principle that consists of abolishing marginalization, discrimination and labor market inequalities. Transnational strategies will make access to employment to disadvantaged groups. I do not accept the amendments they calculate once again on GMBs, because these technical assistance agencies have been the subject of fierce and justified criticisms on the work of the previous committee. Our Committee on Employment and Social Affairs was, as is well known, responsible for the analysis of significant deficiencies and omitted revisions related to Leonardo. Therefore, the Commission cannot be rid of even the Equal from direct responsibility and control. The Commission may not approve the proposals of the Member States unless they meet all the conditions: first, the work on the integration through sectoral and geographical partnerships where the guidelines of the policy, the second, the systematic integration of the agents, the systematic integration of the agents,Training, universities, NGOs, social partners and the private sector with the aim of creating a sustainable corporate relationship, thirdly, to ensure a clearly innovative nature of methods and standards. The Commission must therefore be committed to the strategic framework for promoting the ability to work and the quality of work, evaluating the results and the effective transmission of optimal practices. Then only the desired multiplier effect will be achieved. Mr President, I would like to refer to the Commission's proposals on the position of the budget for the promotion of the CPC. On October 26, 1999, the European Commission approved a proposal to ensure that there is a legal basis for the position of budget, which concerns the public information on the CPP. This proposal will delete the current budget B2-5122 budget and create a new budget title, B1-382. Actions that promote understanding between young farmers and the EU, and create stronger links with EU candidate countries and the outside world are important. Therefore, I submit these amendments to Parliament in order to support the contribution of such programs.	el
At the same time, surveys conducted in the ports of Belgium, Finland and Japan, it appears that 50% of container containers containing part of a dangerous load are not delivered in the right way. In short, the importance of the issue is great. If we look at the situation of security advisers, we will find that, as of January 1, in some countries it is now mandatory to have a security adviser to businesses. Thus, there are serious problems in compliance with the provisions, especially in small businesses that cannot deal with costs. These companies are either relieved of their loads or mixing them with other loads, resulting in certain problems. For this reason, these activities may be included in the form of annual reports and operational analysis in the form of ISO 9002. The job has been done, now must be followed by the adherence to the provisions. Allow me to raise one last point. Regarding the compliance with the provisions, good agreements with the Eastern European countries must be convened, because these countries will join the relevant conditions from 1 July 2001, that is, after a year and a half. This gives them a temporary competitive advantage. The fact is not bad in itself, but what we need to do is to prioritize the aspects of safety for product transport through road and rail artery and internal floating roads and to incorporate these aspects as soon as possible as part of the acquis, and submit them to the countries. Madam President, is properly drawn to the body the attention of members in the importance of transport safety. The constant increase in the quantities of goods trafficked in Europe implies some risks - direct and indirect - to industry staff and the social environment. Therefore, those who have to face these risks must meet high standards. Standards set in another Directive, Directive 95/35/EC, seem to be sufficient to give responsible advice to interested parties on the transfer of dangerous goods. I am glad that an agreement was reached with the Council on the basic requirements for their examination terms, although I would prefer unified standards and sections, so that the diplomas were internationally equal. But this seems to be impossible. Finally, the amendment proposed by the rapporteur is perfectly logical and I will highly support it. Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, Dear colleagues, I would first like to congratulate his colleague Koch on his reports that may be technical in nature but are extremely important for security. I would like to make just a few observations. First of all, I would like to ask Mrs. Commissioner - and I am sure that my desire will encounter appropriate territory - as increased attention to the issue of security, whether it be road arteries, floating streets or sea. When I see that the Commission's first proposal was submitted on March 19, 1998 and that we are dealing with it today - while reacting to parliament relatively quickly - then this period is a bit big.	el
"President!""It is miserable in terms of development cooperation between the European Union."" This was to be read in a newspaper article on the Union's development policy in a past week.This assessment is not new.Since we deal with development cooperation in Europe, their effectiveness and quality have been questioned.Hope for improvement threatens to disappear if the Commission continues to refuse to look in the mirror.Why wasn't the critical report on the coherence of development policy published?An important conclusion of this report concerned the contradictions inherent in European politics.In contrast to development policy, European politics is particularly in the areas of trade and agriculture.We do not succeed in making a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.This is related to the different views in terms of development cooperation in the individual countries of the Union.We are no longer allowed to consider development and cooperation as an instrument of external relationships, but it is to be assessed as an independent policy area.I advocate a transparent, solidarity and efficient development policy.As long as European approaching to the development problem causes inefficiency and waste of money, it is advisable to assign a greater role to the Member States.Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the European Parliament as quickly as possible to the European Parliament so that we too can think about possible solutions.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!I think this initiative is useful and sensible in every respect.As several colleagues have already mentioned, we always experience situations in which there is a great contradiction between what we want to achieve with development and cooperation policy, and what we can withdraw with other sectoral policies that pursue opposite interests in the development of the same countries.We are not only talking about the concrete effects of our joint measures, on tourism, the environment, agriculture, fishing, industry.In general - and this is the worst - we talk about the contradictions between our economic and trade policy measures and our defense policy measures.Ultimately, there are a number of situations that are contradictory.In my opinion, the contradictions in the area of ​​community policies are not quite as pronounced.However, they are more pronounced for certain objectives and industries of some member states.We have to be clear about that.On the one hand, we often accept resolutions about peace processes in other parts of the world, such as recently in the case of Indonesia, a case screaming.Then again we find that some European countries had delivered weapons and war material to them.For me, these are the most serious contradictions in this whole area, they are more serious than those that result from a certain incompatibility of the sectoral policies, which are also available.Of course, we know that there are always contradictions between several policies within a certain country.This is normal.At the level of the European Union, we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the individual community policies, in this case in development policy.We have to be aware that these contradictions are available and that we have to reduce them as far as possible."	de
However, we must take action to ensure that the victims are less in the future. The only sure way to achieve this is to send a clear message to those responsible for crimes against humanity and who must be brought before justice for their unnecessary acts. The courts that are now being tried by the culprits for the barbarism that took place in the Balkans send a clear message. In addition, despite the fact that she finally resulted in a fiasco, the Pinochet case in the United Kingdom also had its positives. The unprecedented decision of the House of Lords is an example of one of the ways in which the countries concerned can demonstrate those who commit crimes against humanity that they cannot hide anywhere. As positive as these developments are, more must be done. There must be a continuation, and the establishment of an international criminal court has marked a significant development in the human rights sector. However, it will only symbolize a statement full of trusted and empty rhetoric unless its statutes come into force. To achieve this, it requires the ratification of 60 Member States and the seven states that have ratified unfortunately only one EU, in particular Italy. In the Council and the Presidency I would like to say the following this morning: If you want to ensure that those who violate human rights laws will be brought to justice, if you want to send a clear message, if you want to prevent more victims in the future, you need to use it in the future. Rome and you should use all the influence you have in the rest of the world to achieve the magical goal of the 60 countries needed to ensure that the statute of the International Criminal Court will actually begin to apply. Mr President, I fully agree with the Council's statement that Geneva's contracts have been a major stage in the development of humanitarian law. I also agree that contracts are just as necessary today as 50 years ago. Let me take advantage of the opportunity to express my full recognition of the enormous humanitarian work done by the International Red Cross and other humanitarian organizations, both in terms of the dissemination of the humanitarian principles expressed in the Geneva Conventions, and the help of the world. First, there is a gap between the principles and their application and, secondly, there are essential conditions that are not covered by the contracts. Let me demonstrate the ever -increasing gap between the principles of conventions and their practical implementation, stating that the conflicts that broke out in the last decade killed 10 times more citizens than soldiers. It is about the opposite of the situation during the First World War. The jacket gap between the principles and their application is due to my opinion to the fact that the character of the wars has changed in the last 50 years.	el
"In my opinion, it is obvious that regional and local authorities, their representative organizations, the Regional Committee and, of course, the European Parliament, should have participated in the clearest way, as soon as possible in the preparation of this program. However, we must say that this was not done in preparation by the Committee of its announcement, which was published on October 13. Although I approve the general directions of Interreg III, in my opinion it is extremely important to ensure a better structure between this program - funded by the European Regional Development Fund - and other external cooperation funds and in particular the European Development Fund for the European Countries. In this respect, I would like to thank the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee who approved one of my amendments, which is added to the list of these funds. Over -centered areas, especially the four French overseas apartments, must be able to coordinate Interreg III and the EDF so that they in turn can finance cooperation plans with their neighbors from the ACP countries in their respective geographical zones. In addition, I ask the Commission to review the slim possibilities, which are offered in the transcent and island regions through the general directions presented in the announcement. These regions should be able to benefit from Interreg III, as is the case with all other areas of the Union, as the regis program provided for them has now been abandoned. Finally, to conclude, I would like to express my disappointment on the small financial grant for Chapter C, which relates to the interregional cooperation of which, however, the Community added value is unquestionable. Mr President, I start with the Equal report and equality between men and women, even though I have to admit that at times it is painful to talk about this issue because of its constant repetition, in any case when one has my age. Unfortunately, however, it is necessary once again to point out that there is still no equality. However, perhaps a progress on this issue will lead to changes in other areas. Because, for me, equality does not mean both spouses to a wedding to work constantly and assign the children to the nanny, that is, to a migrant, who never had the opportunity to find another job. In such a case, we will not have moved on by the time of the kings who ruled God. No, equality means all of us to participate equally in both work and family life. Unfortunately, developments do not go in this direction, on the contrary. That is why I believe that point 7 contains a matter of key importance. There he says: ""The central interest of the Equal program is to be a laboratory for the promotion and dissemination of new methods to combat discrimination in the employment market"". Hopefully he will be successful. Something else, Mr President. I would just like to mention the process that a possible absence of me when the committee answers - not because I have asked some specific questions, but because I really hope that the Commission has heard my observations - it will be due to the fact that, along with this discussion, the commission is also held by the Commission."	el
Commission's communication recommends a greater exchange of experiences, as well as the implementation of a high -level group and benchmarking.In addition, the social protection report must be published each year and be examined at the same time as the employment report.That's good, but that is not enough.We offer a procedure similar to the Luxembourg process.Clear guidelines and indicators are necessary, while Member States must develop methods in national action plans.We are shaping a common model, but keep subsidiarity.This social convergence is a process that will continue for a long time.Parliament must therefore be involved in work - not by entering the high -level group, but so that the representative of the Parliament can follow the work in this group and come with proposals on how to continue the process.The Commission's proposal, as well as cooperation for employment, is based on four major objectives.It is a question of: to make the system favorable to employment, to make the pension plan viable in the long term, to promote social integration and to guarantee a protection of sustainable and high level health.All these points are important.In our report, we particularly highlighted the importance of fighting poverty in the EU and finding indicators as quickly as possible in order to advance in this area.Equality between men and women does not have its own pillar.This is mainstreaming in question.The aspects of equality between men and women must therefore find themselves in the four pillars.We took note of this.We submit a multitude of proposals so that, for example, we go to individual social protection systems, that parental leave gives the right to social security benefits, that the possibilities of reconciling family life and professional life are improved and that basic old age pensions ensure a decent standard of living.These proposals promote above all women.In addition to this strategy of European social convergence, a concrete plan is necessary in terms of legislative work in the social field, as well as proposals for a framework agreement in the context of social dialogue with a concrete calendar.We expect the Parliament to present this in its proposal for a social action program.Social convergence is also necessary with a view to enlargement, on the one hand to strengthen the social model and, on the other hand, to remove the risks of social dumping.The Commission must consider the development of a specific action program relating to social policy in the context of enlargement.We had a constructive discussion at the Commission.We had many amendments, but we managed to agree on a report.The number of amendments subject to the vote of the Parliament is now reduced to fifteen.This is explained by the fact that we have significant convergence.Part of these amendments come back from reading to the Commission and I will reject them.I will also reject the amendments deposited by the TDI group, because I do not think they bring something to the report.	fr
Here the crucial point must be set.I am convinced, revered Council Presidency that this will be designed accordingly under your leadership.Mr. Council President, you have taken from the various explanations that both in the committee for constitutional questions and at the level of the group leader of the European Parliament, which, although did not prevail, to trust Portuguese Presidency and not to increase the difficulties by shifting the beginning of the government conference.I can assure you that last week in the committee, the chair of which I was noted, it was not easy to get there, but in the end we decided to rely on the Portuguese council presidency, and we do not want to lose our bet.They told us about the beginning of their tour through the European capitals and the difficulties of some governments, approval in their countries and thus in their parliaments.I would like to draw your attention to the fact that yesterday we did a very interesting day of the discussion and dialogue with representatives of the 15 national parliaments who were present with expert and committed delegations.It was not about drawing conclusions - which was not possible - but the pronunciation was certainly very encouraging.In my opinion, we have to be vigilant and make sure that the national governments try to gain their parliaments for the ratification of solutions that correspond to the requirements of the further development of the Union, and are not behind supposed resistances of the parliaments in order not to sign the corresponding decisions at the negotiating table of the government conference.In any case, we will strengthen our cooperation and dialogue with the governments of the Member States throughout the government conference.Yesterday was also talked about the Commission, which was represented by Commissioner Barnier, who explained her position;Their efforts were recognized, although different views were represented in relation to the suggestions, as she, Mr. Council, expressed various points of view to my impression.However, it should be emphasized that yesterday, too, many of the danger were aware that the expansion could be questioned the original concept of the construction of a political union, which was also pointed out in an interview that will certainly not have escaped anyone due to the authority of his author, Jacques Delors.Therefore, we have to work on the fact that during the government conference there is really talk of how the democratic foundations of the Union, such as - and yesterday was also talked about in this high house when it came to the situation in Austria - which can be strengthened the basis of the Union of the principles, values ​​and rights as well as the role of the political institutions of the Union, also in the area of ​​economic policy.We rely on the Portuguese Presidency, we rely on ourselves and to the Commission, so that as part of the government conference, all of these questions can be discussed constructively and conclusively.President!Only a strengthened Europe can manage the expansion.Only a strengthened Europe can counter political opportunists who take advantage of dissatisfaction.Therefore, fundamental reforms and therefore an extended agenda for the government conference are required.The Finnish presidency only listened to minimalist governments and unfortunately was not at least accessible to this parliament.	de
"I appreciated this very much. In general, I would be very happy if this system was implemented for the simple reason, that it would only be possible to execute Dublin's decisions. This will clearly be clearly defined by the jurisdiction of the Member State responsible for the process of administration of asylum, which would indirectly result in some measure and weight distribution. It is added here that this way we will be able to prevent multiple asylum applications from the same persons and abuse of asylum, and if you will even, we will indirectly contribute to the fight against illegality. That is, it is a system as a whole that should be tackled very positively and considered completely necessary in the context of asylum and immigration policy as well as in relation to the responsibilities of the Member States. What surprised me was that the Council canceled our plans at its meeting on December 2 as it did not accept the responsibilities for the implementation of the system to the Commission, that is, the responsible Regulatory Committee to act under the Commission. This ultimately means that we did not do what we wanted, namely the community of the system, but that the Council canceled our plans by claiming the corresponding powers again for itself. The result is that the Commission does not direct this means to the interest of the community, but again to take things into the hands of the Council to exclude the Commission and consequently parliament. We neither want nor we can accept it, because it has consequences that reach the point that the system will be excluded in the end and that statistical surveys will no longer be possible to carry out analyzes and draw the necessary conclusions, as well as that we need to be delayed. The question to you is this: When can we really figure out that the Eurodac system we have been waiting for so long? What will ultimately be its particular form? Will our regulations and desires be taken into account to entrust its entire scope to the Commission? Because then we would have achieved our main goal and we need. We would have made another European affair, because it is reasonable here to truly implement this community. Mr President, Mr. MPs, I will answer directly and without spin to the questions asked, so that there is no doubt about the position of the Council, and because I believe that it is important to completely clarify this case. Regarding the scope of the Eurodac system, I will remind you that Article 1 of the proposal for the establishment of this system is particularly clear. I read the relevant text: ""A system called Eurodac is established, the aim of which is to contribute to the determination of the Member State which will be responsible, in accordance with the provisions of the Dublin Convention"" - I repeat: ""According to the provisions of the Dublin Convention"" - ""Dublin Convention, in the context of the provisions of this Regulation ""."	el
However, it would be more appropriate if the Union focused on its financial expenses on the existing community policies.Of course, some take the opportunity to beat each other with demands for more financial means, which is particularly inappropriate at a time when state budgets are particularly inappropriate due to the convergence criteria for the WWU.Ms. McCarthy proposes to increase the middle equipment for urban and the announcement of this community initiative by means of a costly PR campaign with which the benefits of the federal Europe are to be praised.It shouldn't be necessary to point out that the effectiveness of an edition does not depend on the amount of the funds provided for a project.On the contrary, the recipients of too numerous and too high aid are ultimately accepted as given.The goal must not be to make citizens a recipient of support, but their personal responsibility must be strengthened.The report also speaks sustainably for measures in favor of ethnic or sociological minorities.We can only reject a minority policy that is necessarily detrimental to the social cohesion.On the one hand, it promotes the integration of immigrants, while their cultural assimilation in the recording country would be necessary to avoid the development of ethnic ghettos as potential powder barrels.On the other hand, it deals with the principle of positive discrimination, which, as the American precedent shows, proves to be equally harmful.For all of these reasons, the French delegation of the Uen faction could not agree to Ms. McCarthy's report.Report Decourrière (A5-0028/2000) Mr. President, the Interreg program is particularly important to us.Like numerous other colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament has managed to preserve this Interreg initiative.Since I even live in the Belgian part of the Sarre-Lor-Lux Süd region, I know that Europe is being created there, that we are experiencing Europe every day and that the European unification process is indeed carried by the citizen.These projects really have to be taken into account and must already include sustainable development.Why do I emphasize this point?For the simple reason, because the current projects all too often affect the environment.For example, if you accept new roads, you accept new immissions in the European Union, and this completely contradicts politics that we z.B. to combat the emission of greenhouse gases.I also demand that the commission pays attention to the project selection that the environmental policy pillar of EU policy is integrated into these projects so that, for example,B. the goal of CO2 reduction is taken into account as a special added value in the proposed projects.I think especially of certain infrastructures in the planning.As is well known, some Member States have not yet decided between rail and road to cross susceptible areas such as the Pyrenees and here, especially the Aspe Valley.I also think of my region, where my member state fluctuates between a railway line and a second motorway, the A 32.Therefore, I ask the Commission to make sure that there is a real agreement between the individual policies and especially within the selected Interreg projects.Mr President, I voted for the DECourrière report on the Community Initiative Interreg, in particular because of the answer that Commissioner Barnier granted some MPs who asked for more consideration of the border regions with a sea limit in the program.	de
"We are willing to come to an agreement with the Council. But the Council has so far rejected any serious agreement with us. That is why I call on the body to support our amendment that a significant proportion of 90% of the cost of waste disposal should be covered by general port fees. Then we will be able to agree with the Council, in the context of the conciliation process, 75% or anything else. That is why my request to the Commission: Mrs Vice -President, watch out for which side you will support! I think that in the interests of environmental protection and a long, flourishing tourism industry in many countries in our community it is best to have an effective system. So support the system of non -imposing special fees we suggested. Perhaps then we will achieve a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation process. Mr President, I am glad that you are especially directing this debate, since I know that, as Bavarian, you always hear the demands related to the ports and the seas. I would like to thank the rapporteur, Theo Bouwman, for the work he has done, as well as for his collaboration with us by preparing tomorrow's vote. Tomorrow there will be some issues. First, we know that transporting people and goods by ship is more environmentally friendly than other modes of transport. At the same time we know that ships greatly contribute to the pollution of the seas through waste, cargo remains and oil sludge. Ship fuels are slow oil, and we know that 1% to 3% of this oil are left as a remnant of oil sludge, which is usually rejected in the seas. I think we agree that ships should remove pollutants and load residues in the port. This implies this - and there can be no different logic: what is required first of all to have clean seas is to stop the illegal waste rejection in the middle of the sea. This is the point and we have discussed it here many times. In January we had a very thorough discussion with you, Mrs. Commissioner, on the impact of the shipwreck ""Erika"". Then we had recapitated all the areas related to ship safety and clean seas. And in this Directive on Port Facilities for Receipt of Cargo Residues, the question is how to get cleaner seas. Information alone: ​​We know that only 70,000 cubic meters of pollutants are illegally rejected in the North Sea and, on the other hand, we know that at most 5% to 10% of ships now follow the legal route, that is, they remove their waste in the ports. This scandal is also unacceptable from the Council's point of view. The Council says, as we do, that all ports must have appropriate Waste Reception Facilities and that they must be equipped with them. Our difference is ultimately the question: How will the waste will be covered? At first reading, the vision of the vast majority of Parliament was that ships should contribute to a significant proportion, ie at least 90%."	el
We keep the resolution that we will vote here today, as a continuation of the current discussion at the Brussels mini session. We agree with all the aspects presented here: the need to continue the arrangement of rescue and emergency aid for people who are homeless, the need to evaluate the overall effects of the crisis and the need to coordinate and combine forces to overcome predictable health problems, and to restore agriculture and rebuild the country. However, we do not have to take guilt for our slowdown. We also have to ask what other countries on other continents have done? What have India and Pakistan do with considerable resources and have large settlements in Mozambique? What are African neighboring countries done? For example, Angola has great armed forces that could have given valuable help, or Zimbabwella next to it, or Nigeria with operational air forces. This issue must also be made for the upcoming Summit between the European Union and Africa, so that we can communicate better for both of them in the area of ​​solidarity. I also have to say that the issue of forgiveness of foreign debt is an important topic for us, but we are more in favor of the text of a common resolution. I have to say that as a Christian Democrat, I am prone to the appeal made by the Catholic Church this year, so that the third world's foreign debt is generally subject to concrete actions. However, for many African countries, we need to distinguish between different situations. There are cases where the assets collected by the leaders in these countries could pay the country's foreign debt, so there are some questions in this area that must be carefully weighed. We know that this is not about Mozambique because of its poverty. In our opinion, the resolution, which manifests itself from the proposal, is good, and I have to say at this stage that the position of our Portuguese government is immediately forgiven by the position of the Portuguese government. Mr President, the media have given an incorrect picture of the destruction of Mozambique. When the world saw desperate people on the roofs and trees of the houses, the aid had already started, but it was not shown in the media. In any case, hard images make citizens strong and they provide a strong foundation for relief work. The downside is that the damage that does not exceed the news threshold does not actually exist. Therefore, it is important that international relief organizations do not allow the media to guide their activities, but to act on the need for help of people in distress. According to the organizations involved, help started, nevertheless, relatively fast. It may be true, but it does not apply to primary rescue measures. The Commission was not responsible for them but by different governments. Airplanes, helicopters, nutrition and medicines must be available as needed and immediately. I mean it literally. Only the length of the journey and not bureaucracy may be affected by the waiting time. For this, better cooperation between relief organizations and military forces is needed. It is a good thing that Commission member Nilsson herself traveled to Mozambique herself. What are his experiences and what does he think about criticism of the government? What does he think of the criticism of coordination? The amount of 25 million aid grant is now sufficient now, but should be raised later. Mozambik is now in a very difficult situation. The onset of diseases must be prevented, mines must be cleared and re -settlement must be started. For many Mozambicians, misery begins only now that the media has left the country. Therefore, the Parliament, the Council and the Commission themselves must closely monitor the victims' President, all of us know that the consequences of the tragic floods and disaster of Mozambique would have been much smaller if the more sophisticated states, especially the European Union, which has special responsibility for the former Portuguese colonial, would have reacted immediately.to save people.	fi
If this certificate and proof of insurance are not available, the ship is shut down and must not leave the port despite all the port fees.We have to agree on that in all ports of the European Union, from Marseille to Rotterdam to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven and wherever ships land.Fourth, we need liability for the ship owner, not only a ridiculous $ 12 million, but at least $ 400 million, which the ship owner must prove by proof of insurance.Then we need the country's liability, the flag of which leads the ship.We need the security that the country, under the flag of which the ship runs, assumes liability in case of doubt.It will be a wonderful control!I can guarantee that the countries that award the flag also make sure that they do not have to be liable.Fifth, we need the guarantee that this will be required for all ships in the ports and in the water of the European Union, also in the accession countries.This means that these requirements that I have mentioned apply to all waters.After all, we need the most important thing: we need a good memory, because we will talk about legislation more often in the near future.We will talk about environmental standards more often.Then I don't want anyone to come and say: These requirements lead to us losing jobs in the port.The unions come, the industry is coming.We need good memory, colleagues.I look at many of them who have not yet represented the top of the environmental movement.Go home and say: We have not yet taken care of the standards.We need a good memory when it comes to what is required in the ports.We need a good memory when we say: We once agree on port fees and port requirements and do not play one against the other in the European Union.If we can do it, we may be better in a few years!President!Ms. Roth-Behrendt spoke to me from the heart.It provided us with a perfect compilation of the various measures.But how will the crisis consciousness that we have developed from this environmental disaster?Let me call me the introduction of the freeboard brand of an earlier generation, a label that should prevent insurance fraud with limited seaworthy ships.Where has the crisis consciousness of the generations left before us?I think we should introduce the certificate that Mrs. Roth-Behrendt spoke, as well as the labeling of tankers with green brands, as was stimulated by some ports in Europe.In addition, the classification companies have to check critically because we cannot accept their procedure.We need an independent and transparent process.In conclusion, I would like to mention that some Commission's agencies see it as inadmissible promotion of advertising if environmental funding is paid to shipowners in my country who want to improve environmental quality.At the Commission, the right hand does not know what the left is doing.It is not justifiable if measures that are in line with the Commission guidelines for environmental improvement may not be carried out because they are regarded as an inadmissible promotion of advertising.	de
"They alone are able to invent policies likely to modify structures that have been developed by men for men.Because it is indeed to the structural discrimination that women are most faced, whether in politics or on the job market.It is therefore up to European political parties to open up to women.Moreover, article 191 of the Treaty (ex 138 a) underlines, I quote, their ""important role as a factor of integration within the Union"".This article continues by affirming that ""they contribute to the formation of a European awareness and identity, as well as to the expression of the political will of the citizens of the Union"".If such a provision has no legal value, it is no less highly symbolic.It gives political parties an important role in the construction of a democratic Europe.This can pass, for example, through the implementation of positive actions, through the promotion of parity within our political parties.Some parties have, on the occasion of the 1999 European elections, presented joint lists.This is a good practice, which must be generalized.I do not know if there is a link of cause and effect, but the fact remains that the proportion of women deputies in the European Parliament increased from 25.7 % in 1994 to 29.9 % in 1999. In addition, he has been chaired by a woman since the 1999 elections. I will end by taking up the conclusions drawn from the April 1999 conference organized by the Commission, entitled ""women and men in power"".Equality between men and women is not a problem that only concerns women, it is an issue that affects our whole society!Progress has recently been made in the increase in the number of women present in the Union's decision -making bodies.In our own institution, 30 % of elected representatives are today women, including the president of the European Parliament herself.Finland has also just elected a woman as a presidency.On average, almost a quarter of the governments of the Member States and just over a fifth of their parliaments is made up of women.These rates are still far from satisfactory, in particular given that the figures vary strongly from one Member State to another: women in the Nordic countries are much more represented in positions of responsibility and in decision -making processes.This situation is more a reflection of respect for the quality and competence of the contribution of women to the company than the result of quotas set.My group is not favorable to the use of quotas in general because, in the long term, they may go against the aim sought, or even to undermine the cause which they aim to support.We nevertheless recognize that experiences vary from one Member State to another and that certain recourse to such measures are sometimes justified, as a temporary remedy, with a view to rebalancing the representation of women where they are clearly underrepresented.We could support the resolution on women in the decision-making process, adopted in order to commemorate the international day of women on March 8, for which the Liberal group filed ten amendments and relaxed the reference to quota in accordance with the approach advanced above."	fr
The Balkan and Adriatic regions are particularly important, but in my opinion, we must not forget cooperation with Russia.Our group wishes to again raise the question of controlling the use of funds and insists in particular on better coordination of the Tacis, ISPA and flagship programs.This coordination is lacking and the commission has still not presented specific projects in order to improve it.Here in Parliament, we are waiting for the European Commission to inform our commission in the best time.During the practical realization, the participation of companies, organizations and other local actors is of decisive importance.Cooperation projects, based on experience, require better planning, more precise follow -up and more fruitful achievement.Projects have often remained halfway and efficiency has drowned in administration and bureaucracy.It is also necessary to demand from the partners of commitment to projects and the accomplishment of their own part.Our group reintroduces a few amendments been rejected during the committee examination.I will also mention the URBAN report in the explanation of the reasons from which the rapporteur dealt with merit the minimum of 500 euros per inhabitant, which refer to the guidelines of the Commission.This will not work as a mechanical objective but it will be necessary to be able to apply it according to the circumstances which reign in the region concerned.It is such an important aspect that it must be reported from the presentation of reasons to the conclusions.Mr. President, Dear colleagues, Interreg is the initiative which has the most European dimension of all structural funds.Here, projects should not only be promoted at regional or national level, but also in the neighboring regions which concern two or more countries.Unfortunately, this applies only to part of the money, namely for the borders included within the EU.But it is precisely the regions located on the border of third countries that require an effective instrument promoting cross -border cooperation.The regulations claim that this is the case.However, this is not the case.We have been in a situation where the Commission has not changed the regulations for years, although Parliament has been demanding it for a long time.Concretely, this will mean tomorrow for these regions a new deterioration of the situation in terms of support for border areas.The Parliament has requested since 1996 the creation of a common fund for cooperation with third states, in order to remove these difficulties.Nothing happened!These problems will again be able to ease and this in the expense of the regions concerned.Consequently, Parliament once again demands an improvement on this subject and the development of cross -border cooperation.We are also waiting for a common fund to be created and that the regulations be changed again in collaboration with the other commissioners.We want a Europe of citizens, not a Europe of bureaucrats!Mr. President, a third of the European Union resources go to funds for various development objectives.	fr
"I am pleased to tell Member Van Hulten and Member Harder that the detailed recommendations for recruitment, training, evaluation and names for management positions are quite largely in line with our own way of thinking and proposals. I would also like to move towards a linear career system because the current career-based system is no longer suitable for the needs of our institutions. It is clear that the current system succeeds in stopping the progress and mobility of capable persons. Those members who, during this debate, have rightly praised Commission officials, who, for the most part, are very honest, hard -working and quite capable of their attention in their attention. The White Book on the Reform Strategy is going to clearly reveal our own thoughts about these and other factors, but detail and accuracy are obviously important. Multiple communications will be published over the next few months. Each of them is left to the Parliament to be considered and responded. On the other hand, it is quite clear that we have to work closely with the Parliament on the key issues in the common interest of the institutions, which I mean pay, pensions, and review of personnel rules. From this last point, we have considered whether it would be useful to introduce a framework regulation that sets common regulations on important issues such as wages, working conditions, representation rights, etc., but that would give different institutions a manner of maneuver for the enforcement of other issues. It would be quite positive if the parliament gave his early notions of this preliminary idea. Finally, I will highlight paragraph 15 of the resolution under Parliament, which is related to the resource requirements of our change policy. It is obviously quite essential. We are confident that we will enjoy the significant savings brought about by the reforms as the reform measures begin to influence the use of our resources in an increase in efficiency and enhances leadership. However, it is quite clear that some of the Commission units are already operating at their extreme. Parliament has often raised this issue. Secondly, it is also quite clear that the reforms require some new investment in professional development and technology. Thirdly, it is quite clear that it is necessary to make the preparations for expansion more efficient. There are already problems with the adequacy of resources. It is also clear that we have to define what the so -called.""negative priorities"" and leave these negative priorities to release the resources that are saved, if we take on new tasks, which the Council and Parliament will surely ask for us. Thus, it is central to the reform to find a more precise process that binds the process of setting the primary goals to distribute resources based on function management. However, I would like to emphasize the following: Although the Commission will certainly be introduced to set the primary goals of the inner discipline, it can only succeed in the fullest if Parliament and the Council are involved and are equally uncompromising about these Commission challenges. Therefore, the Commission is positive about Van Hulten's report 15. Finally, the Mr President, I thank Parliament for its interest during this long speech, and to expressly sincerely sincerely thanks to the rapporteur, the budget supervisory committee and other committees who made their statements. We hope that we can cooperate closely with the Parliament to complete the reform strategy package and that, after the most important, we can work with the Parliament without interruption for the years that are needed to conduct such complex issues. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered tomorrow at 12 noon.(The session ended at 11:15 pm) The Middle East Peace Process (Continuation) The next agenda is the statements of the Council and the Commission of the Middle East Peace Process..(EN) I am very grateful to the chairman of the Council for his statement about his Middle East at the beginning of this conversation, and I am very grateful to hear some of Minister Gama's insights, for he came in a hurry from that area."	fi
This should be prioritized in the efforts of the parliament delegation that will visit this crisis area in the coming weeks. Only a political solution to all the issues related to the conflict, as well as the reconstruction of the area, can ensure that the terrible situation of people in destroyed cities and villages, refugee camps and prison camps are changing. However, I would like to warn that one should not proceed with unilateral convictions and the performance of responsibilities exclusively on the Russian side. As the report of the Council of Europe delegation presents, human rights violations and war crimes were committed by all war participants. These cases should be clarified and consistently requested by the perpetrators. But we should also give the competent Russian bodies the opportunity to do this job itself. Mr President, yesterday we had a welcome visit to the European Parliament of a delegation of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Commonwealth of Independent States. This visit gave us the unique opportunity to openly discuss the issue of the Russian -Chechnya war with other Members. Visitors asked us to understand that, as they said, Russia was fighting terrorism, it did not wage a real war and that the struggle against terrorism has deteriorated, because robbers who consider Russia's power were providing large quantities of weapons and weapons. We gave our answer. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe, and even its need to provide security and protection to its citizens from outside attack, it does not eliminate the responsibilities it has taken on international conventions. I pointed out that if Russia manages to intercept the huge leak of weapons from the country itself, then, in the context of joint efforts, we would have taken a positive step forward in combating terrorism. However, this political history of war and misery has two aspects, and I think we should try to understand the causes of the conflict between Russia and Chechnya, so that we can once again be able to contribute faster to the end of bloodshed. I do not argue that we should currently consider the possibility of sanctions on Russia. We have an obligation, now that the war is almost over, to get in touch with the victims and to contribute to rehabilitation. Dear Mr President, it seems that the war, which began to fight terrorism, has such an end that only a new terrorism can come from it. This situation seems to be a permanent phenomenon in the area in the future. In recent months we have condemned Russian actions in the context of five different resolutions. Indeed, some of them were unilateral, which did not increase their influence. Thoughts, for example, to use the Tacis program in ratification, have only the result that ordinary people will suffer. And yet this did not change the Russian government line. The spread of war and especially terrorism is a common and great threat. That is why we need a Caucasian conference for peace, because these problems do not remain inside the Chechs.	el
We want the European Union level to come to uniform regulations for shipping with all its technical, economic, social and ecological aspects.The dangerous practices of cheap flags must be prohibited in the ports and waters of the 15 Member States and the 13 countries willing to join.We also speak together with the UDB for the creation of coastal guards and the use of sea inspectors that are subject to the direct supervision of the affected shipping areas in order to control the strict compliance of European legal regulations.The assumed resolution points in this direction and has therefore found the unrestricted support of our parliamentary group.I am pleased that the resolution on the effects of the oil plague emitted by the Erika, whose elaboration our faction has made a large contribution, was actually unanimously accepted.Since, in contrast to our previous resolution, it takes a closer look at the extent of the catastrophe, which turns out to be larger every day than the first impressions suggest, it is more demanding, precise and urgent.The overall assessment of the damage caused by all areas of fishing, marine cultures and aquaculture is currently hardly possible.However, it is certain that they are considerable.The balance sheet is worsened every day by new dirt.The losses are not only in sales declines, but also in the form of financial loss.The impairment of the good reputation of marine products cannot currently be expressed in digits.In addition, there are damage caused by the upstream and downstream areas (fish wholesalers, suppliers, tourism, etc.), as well as the costs of the local authorities for the elimination of dirt and the repositioning in the tourism business.Fishing and tourism, the two closely related essential sources of income of most regions of our Atlantic coast, are both severely affected.Therefore, it is necessary, as in our resolution, to emphasize the cause principle, supplemented by the duty of the polluter to remedy damage.It is the duty of the cause to pay for the cleaning of the areas dirty by its fault and for the restoration of the ecological balance disturbed by his guilt.With regard to the compensation procedure, those affected are very worried, because the first payments made by the FIPOL are limited to 25 %.This is a scandal.Of course, each victim must be 100 % compensated.It would be absolutely unthinkable to want to impose part of the damage to the victims, which they arise exclusively by the negligence of the person who was neglected.Furthermore, the initiatives taken by some local regional authorities, such as the Department of Vendée, are welcomed in our resolution to capture the exact condition of the coast before the first oil carpet arrives.This procedure is exemplary because it enables accelerated compensation of the victims, whether private individuals or local authorities.And finally, our resolution makes it clear that in the area of ​​marine safety, the vicious circle of general irresponsibility must be put to an end, this contradictory system of mutual paralysis, in which the states and the Union are of mutual advantage of the responsibility.Everyone has to perform the tasks that he arrives.The Commission, whose American reflex did not come into play this time, must quickly work out a general framework for marine safety.	de
We know that these waste is there and how we have to deal with it, and there is no excuse for not acting.This guideline pursues three goals.First of all, we want to restrict the use of poisonous heavy metals in the production of new cars.On the other hand, we want to fix the responsibility of the manufacturers.We can no longer take care of products at the end of their life cycle, but have to rely on waste avoidance.As many of the various materials contained in the product, as many must be recovered as possible.Third, we want to achieve the recycling goals specified in this guideline.These are the three most important intentions of the directive.The material that is present in the cars does not constitute a wasteland of resources. Above all, the manufacturer's resources are dealt with in a lavish way if we do not take care of the life cycle of a car.Two questions were raised here of great importance - of course there are more, but I would like to mention the two most important ones.First of all: who should pay for that?The second question is: With this draft we weaken the competitiveness of the European automotive industry?The first question is about who should bear the costs.According to the guideline, these are primarily to be taken over by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles of manufacturer's responsibility and the principle of pollutor.However, it is clear that these costs are borne together by manufacturers and consumers.We calculated that the effort for recycling a car does not make up more than 1 % of the price for a new vehicle.Can we fool ourselves that this money disappears if the directive was not accepted?No, of course we will all have to bear the cost of destroying the environment, and that becomes much more expensive.In addition, these only fall after a long time.So the costs do not disappear, but we now make it clear where the responsibility is and how the financial effort should be distributed.Are we talking about a crisis -shaped automotive industry here?Is the discussion about an industry with low profit clashing, which we have to help by not imposing him even more?Can't the vehicle industry afford it at all?Doesn't our true intention actually be weakening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry?No, of course not!Do you think that consumers' reputation will fall silent after environmentally friendly cars and vehicles with less fuel consumption in the future?What do you think, what requirements our children and child children or the legislators of the future will put on the cars?Of course, that these must be environmentally friendly, can be recycled, use little fuel and do not pollute our environment!Only in this way can we give the vehicle industry a future.We have to create healthy incentives to recycle waste and reuse materials and that we can exist in competition with environmentally friendly vehicles with low fuel consumption.The fact that the European automotive industry is already well advanced compensates it to it that even more cars roll through Europe for which it has to take responsibility.These are not horrendous sums or an unsolvable task.	de
The water problem and the location of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are also still unsolved.Finally, I would like to cut the question of a future Palestinian state.This could be proclaimed this year, with or without the consent of Israel.The Barak government has to understand that one was ready to conclude a peace agreement with a state as a contractual partner.Even if the negotiations should not be completed in September of this year, there are no contractual obstacles for the proclamation of a Palestinian state after this point in time.For us, which we support this idea, it is of great importance in this context that this state, as Commissioner Patten formulated, is characterized by transparency and democracy.We all want to contribute to this.President!First of all, I would like to refer to the joint motion application presented at the end of this pronunciation, where my parliamentary group has participated, and of course we agree.In particular, however, I would like to express our joy that Israel and Syria are going back on one another after such a long period of stagnation in order to accommodate their disputes.The recent negotiations are an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East. In this respect, it is regrettable that the peace talks have been temporarily suspended.Both sides will actually have to make great efforts.Stable peace in the region is only possible on the basis of an agreement that guarantees the security of the borders of Israel and the territorial integrity of Syria.To do this, normal diplomatic relationships and a constant dialogue must also be recorded.Hopefully Israel will soon take negotiations with the Lebanon in addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria and, within the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach.Unfortunately, as one of the most important donors, the European Union is still unable to play a significant political role in peace process.This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the common foreign and security policy of the European Union.A special task is responsible for Mr. Solana, the general secretary of the council and high representative for the GASP.The Commission and the Member States must also be encouraged to support projects with the help of which mutual understanding and partnership can be produced between the different peoples of the region.The importance of the Barcelona process, which must have a positive impact on regional cooperation, is also highlighted here.Syria's participation in this process is our consent, provided that it recognizes human rights, does not provide help to the terrorists and supports peace process without restriction.Of course, numerous problems remain unresolved and many questions unanswered, even in relation to the Palestinians.As is well known, the peace process is lengthy and complicated, with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance, we will be convinced of this, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prospering Middle East.President!The fact that the peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine as well as between Israel and Syria are underway despite certain delays and problems gives rise to joy.The moment of truth is close.Is Israel ready to fulfill the UN resolutions and to return the Arab areas conquered in 1967 in exchange for peace and security?	de
The previous experiences have sufficiently proven that linear regulations on personnel loss and incentives, voluntarily extinguishing from the work process, often had undesirable effects.I remember that workers who had retired at the Belgian telephone company had to be called back so that the company did not lose too much know-how and experience.The discussion point will undoubtedly be the reduction in personnel when the postal services liberalization.It should not be forgotten that offers for the voluntary departure above all take on the employees who work under pressure or can easily find a new job, in other words, they are often forces that the company in question itself.In my opinion, it would testify to a consideration of human resources if the Commission would take some of these worries to heart, so that the liberalization of such a sensitive sector as the post is largely socially acceptable.President!Postal services and post offices currently seem to be a very current topic in parliament, and rightly so if you have their importance.Just last week, the newly elected MP held his maiden speech on this topic by our partners from the European Free Alliance, the Plaid Cymru, the Welsh party, in the parliament of the United Kingdom in Westminster.There was also a debate in the Scottish parliament, which was particularly referred to the role of post offices, especially in rural areas, as part of the service offerings and the survival of rural communities.Liberalization does not represent the only potential threat to the services of post offices. As we have heard, post offices in Scotland have to do far more than the post.Governments and some local authorities traditionally use them as a position to pay pensions and other services and also as a place where rents, local taxes, etc. are paid.But to the extent that the modernization of public finances' systems more and more leads to electronic payment transactions through direct debits and transfer, the life offices of the postal offices in the country are threatened.If a post office in the country, which usually also includes the only shop on site, closes, then this can become a great danger to the survival of the community and social cohesion.Instead of admitting that post offices are infiltrated by liberalization or the modernization of systems, the governments and the Commission should promote and support a branched network of post offices and regard them as an assistant on which one can build up by a location and services to be achieved conveniently for the residents.President!The post is responsible for ensuring that the post is delivered everywhere in the city and in the country, a tariff for everyone every day.Post was a public matter for 150 years and, just like public transport and power supply, a core task of national governments.Such obvious and useful core tasks provide people a reason to choose.They show significantly less interest in a government that does not take care of such things.	de
We are in the process of losing market shares.I think we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.I hope you will help us.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!Today we are dealing with a very important sector in which more than 10 million people in the European Union are directly employed and that contributes to the fact that more or less disadvantaged, remote areas and island regions get back on their feet.Tourism also creates additional jobs and thus causes an amusement of employment, especially when it comes to the most sensitive social groups, namely women and adolescents.In my opinion, however, this is blatantly contradicting the fact that there is no European tourist policy.Due to the lack of legal basis, no measures can be taken for this area.Because Article 308 (ex-article 235) repeatedly used, according to which a legal act requires unanimity, it was not even possible to adopt a program of eight million ECU for five years and fifteen Member States.The measures that have so far occasionally been taken were fragmentary and therefore inefficient, the regulations were subject to the dictation of parallel, for example, the consumer protection, environmental, traffic, tax policy, etc., which often not only promoted tourism, but rather disabled, since their implementation usually brought costs for the tourism industry without being checked orThere are incentives to adopt them.I regret that tourism today does not even represent a management, but only a department within the general directorate as part of the restructuring of the Commission's services.We have to support our tourism!In our opinion, essential pillars that could create a foundation are the inclusion of a material-secured chapter on tourism within the framework of the reform, which also represents the legal basis for the sector, the development of an EU-wide tourist policy that promotes the sector without impairing the functioning of the tourism market, the coordination of tourism policy with the other community policies, the sector directly orIndirectly influence, its investigation as well as medium and long-term measures to promote competitiveness of tourist products.Since we are talking about employment, I would like to point out a very serious problem: the competition from Tour Operators and their effects, especially on hotels that are small and medium -sized companies and therefore do not have the necessary equipment and access to information in order to be able to check whether your contractual partner is now or not.Obviously, it is not enough to only work at the national level.Rather, measures to improve the relationships between hoteliers and tour operators, for example a corresponding charter, could be considered.It would also be conceivable to set up a special fund for bankruptcy cases in cooperation with the representatives of both industries.The Commission has already requested quantitative information about the damage that companies arise from such bankruptcies to get an idea.It also asked the European associations of the hotel and restaurant industry as well as travel agencies, Hotrec and Ectaa, to develop a regulation on the regulation of mutual relationships.However, no progress has been recorded since then.	de
"In the individual scientific subjects, however, only few women are represented despite the good results they achieve during their studies.This underrepresentation of women must no longer be accepted.I therefore take note of the European Commission's proposals with great satisfaction.The aim of the Commission document is to focus on the measures to be taken at the community level and especially within the framework of the V. Framework program for research and technological development.Of course I agree with that.Over the next few years, it is about achieving the participation of women up to a percentage of 40 % with the Marie-Curie scholarships and in the advisory and evaluation bodies for the entire V. FTE framework program.To do this, it is necessary to improve the debate and the exchange of experiences between the individual member states and to set up a registration group ""Women and Science"" as part of the V. FTE framework program, the task of which is particularly important in the recording and spread of statistical information on the participation of women in the research activities of the V. FTE framework program.Furthermore, as well as the rapporteur, I think that investigations have to be carried out on the reasons for the discrepancy between the number of women with degrees in scientific subjects and the number of women who actually work in these areas.On the basis of a better analysis of the obstacles to which women encounter, a strategy for their elimination can then be developed.We have to mobilize the numerous existing scientists' networks and achieve their support in developing a common research policy.The European Parliament will continue to pursue the implementation of the V. FTE framework program with regard to the promotion of women and develop ideas for the organization of the next program.In the field of science and research as well as in all other political areas of the European Union, it is important to integrate the gender -specific dimension in order to make a conclusion for once and for all with the structural discrimination, which prevent women from being able to participate equally in the competition on the labor market..(Fri) In its communication ""Women and Science"", the Commission announces the good intention of mobilizing women to enrich European research.This is very good and we are happy about it.Because in fact, too few women are involved in the research work in the European Union.We know that we can only change this underrepresentation of women in the scientific field through a school advisory policy that systematically promotes the diversification of the professional wishes of the girls and, after they have then completed their conclusion, about positive measures at a professional level.Apart from that, some colleagues obviously have abdominal pain because the committee's report for the rights of the woman we assumed contains a point that gives rise to misunderstandings and which some interpret as a quota according to which a proportion of women of 40 % is required in European research.Of course, this is not the case, because such a quota would be unrealistic.In addition, the report does not contain any deadline within which such a quota could be reached.In order to calm the minds and dispel the concerns of the colleagues, I brought in an amendment to the resolution, in which we simply note that the commission undertakes in its communication to make considerable efforts to increase the participation of women to the community research programs, which is at least commendable."	de
"Austria is a free, independent and full -fledged nation. As a result, the Council, the Commission or the European Parliament cannot interfere with the internal affairs of the Member State. The Austrian elections were free, regular and democratic. Therefore, the lack of European institutions in the affairs of this country is not accepted;The intervention is contrary to the European Union (Article 7 of the Amsterdam Convention). However, the same institutions did not hesitate to accept the attachment of Turkey to the European Union, although it is known that there are human rights violations there. Nothing like this has happened in Austria. This precedent on the initiative of the Presidium State Portugal must be concerned about the future of the European Union, as the political declaration of Austria is only demonstrating how a worrying great power is, and on the other hand, that the principle of democracy itself will be destroyed if, in the future, the Member States of the European Union must be blessed. Is there any no longer useful in organizing elections in such situations? This does not create conditions in which European nations would live in harmony and work together for the common future..(FR) The vote in this session is historic, for the first time we are discussing one of our Member State's domestic policy. In these circumstances, in these circumstances, the fundamental issues of the rules of the institutions will lose their meaning. I encourage the Council and its Presidency to continue defending the basic values ​​of the Union. I urge the Commission to be less afraid. With this resolution, Parliament takes responsibility. In my view, the resolution we accept today is minimum minimorum, which we can do. I supported even tougher strokes myself and I supported the checks of 1, 4, 6, 7 and 8, as well as the oral revision presented by the Socialist Group. So I find it absolutely essential that the Council only accepts technical relations with representatives of the Austrian Government if members of the Austrian Freedom Party are involved. If the Jörg Haider party is taken to the government coalition, the extreme right will become a normal issue in Europe and would be a very serious precedent that could have significant consequences in other Member States or applicant states of the Union. The Austrian Conservative Party takes up historical responsibility. Our basic values ​​are in the game: because we are representatives of European democratically, we have no choice. We must refuse to accept something that is not accepted by our voters demand it. When the ghost of barbarianism raises its head, it already means surrender that it does not oppose.. I have voted on the resolution when accepting the empty. I judge Jörg Hider's racist and xenophobic line. However, I cannot accept that the EU body is making a political intervention in the domestic policy of one Member State. Therefore, I cannot accept paragraph 4 of the common resolution and cannot vote for the resolution, even against the extreme right. It is obvious that European political leaders have the right and duty to react against Haider and his party. European political leaders have the right to express their opinion on the political development of another Member State, in the same way as the Prime Minister has the right to express his opinion on racist politics in a municipality. However, Finland's experience has been that integration is a better way to combat the forces of anti -democracy. Therefore, I voted against paragraph 2 of the resolution. This requires, of course, that all parties respect human rights. The ""common reaction"" of the EU Presidential State to the formation of the Austrian government is legally wrong. The reaction of these 14 Member States is not supported in the establishment agreements. Nor should we isolate the forces of Austria that want to work for human rights. In spite of these anti -council remarks and my opinion that it is better to act through integration than isolation, it was important to clearly show the position of the European Parliament on issues of racism, and therefore voted for the resolution in the final vote. The votes end here. Interrupting the session period"	fi
After a month, only a handful of observers were. There were perhaps 100 of them at Christmas time, and in the spring they were not yet a fraction of the agreed strength. Still, the violence was not noticed. Then the war broke out and the observers had to leave. Therefore, I would like to ask a member of the Commission: Can't you do something about not repeating the same mistakes in Europe again? Could you not ensure that the strength of the police forces is raised to 5,000 and that we will train local assistants, who of course make it easier to investigate crimes than foreign assistants? I would also ask: When would you believe they could start their work? And how could local democratic powers gain more power? I want to say this because we have to try to get this solution as soon as possible if we want to give the peace of mind at all. Anyone who has become acquainted with everyday life in Kosovo shares a common view: a democratic vacuum and the inability of different ethnic groups in the cohabitation have caused a tragic and desperate situation: Mitrovica is a sad example of this. Of course, the policy of Miloseviæin in Kosovo before NATO's military intervention was, of course, unacceptable, and the requirements of the independence of the Kosovo regions of the Kosovo regions of the non -violent troops during Rugova were justified. However, NATO's decision on military intervention and the support given to UCK's armed forces were devastating and now they have made Kosovo in addition to the destruction of Serbia's civilian infrastructure. Currently, there is no capable strategy or policy in Kosovo to protect minorities that include not only Serbs and Roma, but also the moderate alban, who are still in power, who are in power. It is useless to talk about the burned houses of the Roma and several thousands of new refugees and the Crane refugees, who are now living in worrying conditions in Kosovo, even as abandoned by the UNHCR, as it has been forgotten, even though the emergency is still dramatic. In a joint resolution, we ask the Council and Member States to double their actions to respect minorities and develop democratic structures and to speak to all those who still believe in cohabitation. In this sense, I agree with the proposals made by Member of Parliament Sakellariou. Another topic of discussion is the release of albanic prisoners from prisons, especially a woman from a very special humanity, Flora Brovina, which I met with black women in Belgrade, in our joint work, in creating connections between women belonging to different ethnic groups. Flora defended himself and urged Serbs and Albanians to hand each other their hands. Flora Brovina's husband is a guest in Belgrade. This gives hope, hope that Serbia can also work in a different way. It is not true that Flora Brovina would have been forgotten, even though the great institutions may have abandoned him, but we who have worked for years in Kosovo and Serbia are working all the time to promote the campaign for his liberation. In my opinion, the European Union also has to do the same. In my opinion, Serbia's embargo has to be dismantled and Serbian must also release political prisoners. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good colleagues, I completely agree with the fierce speech of colleague Pack. What he said is completely true. There is no one truth in Kosovo, there are several. I refuse to accept that we are now talking about reverse genocide here, then injustice to the truth. I totally agree with the content of the present resolution. We judge all kinds of violence there and so we have to do, but we cannot talk about reverse genocide here. Mitrovica's situation is naturally dangerous, and we all know why it is. It also has significant financial benefits and drama of Trepca mines. We have already talked about the fate of political prisoners.	fi
"Question No.8 of K. (H -0042/00): Subject: Guarantees of Export Credit Guarantees and its impact on the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey The G8 Group meeting in Cologne called the OECD to begin the process of establishing common criteria for the granting of export credit. The latter can be used to distort competition and support amphibious plans. Will the EU lead the promotion of this process? The need for it was recently demonstrated by a British government statement that ""is willing to grant"" an export credit license to a company involved in the construction of the Ilisu Dam in Turkey. The World Bank has decided not to fund the plan, which will move 20000 Kurds, will possibly reduce freshwater to Syria and Iraq and cause ecological disaster. What is the view of the Council on the participation of European governments and companies in this plan? The process of establishing these common criteria may have begun in 1978, but clearly the fact that the British government seems to be starting a decisive plan for a mass environmental disaster suggests that there has been no great success so far. I wonder if you could answer a question about investment by Community companies in the EU candidate countries. I ask this because of the issue of cohesion, the topic of the morning debate. On the one hand, we ask the candidate countries to accept the environmental acquis and on the other, at the same time the EU Member States support and encourage investments in these countries, which themselves have a huge environmental disaster. Can you tell me whether this particular issue of investment in the candidate countries has so far been the main issue in any of the discussions you are referring to? Lady MPs, I had not attended the discussion you are referring to. So I would like to tell you that the Council will only be able to provide a written answer, later, to this part of your question. Question No.9 of K. (H-744/00): Subject: Environmental Problems Causted by the Drogoreda Port Development Plan, and the role of the Court of Auditors in the Ireland River Boyne area has arisen between representatives of the Environmental Protection Movement and the GroupCompany of the port Drogheda. The affected area has been designated as a Special Protection Zone (SPA) in the framework of the Wild Bird Directive while being considered as a special conservation zone in the framework of the habitat directive, to the extent that it is an area of ​​international importance. Many local and European associations have criticized the plan hard. Similar cases occur in other areas of the Union, where EU development funding is in conflict with the environmental viability of beneficial measures. Does the Council does not agree that more should be made available within the Court of Auditors in order to investigate or revise such development plans when environmental disagreements arise? What kind of measures does the Council intend to take in order to reinforce the powers of revision and evaluation of European institutions in similar cases?"	el
Mr President, I would first like to congratulate the rapporteur on the Equal Exhibition, Mrs Stenzel, on the work she did in order to understand this difficult issue. Equal is a very difficult program because it is trying to combine various older programs by approaching them in a new way, and this with fewer resources than these programs had in the past. This is a difficult task. The number of people covering these programs has not really been reduced. That is why it is difficult to achieve balance, not only among the different countries, not only among the different parts of the program, but mainly among the different groups referring to the program. This is exactly the problem that has been of our concern to us to this day. Various observations have been heard that the alpha team should be further enhanced by beta. Personally, I was particularly concerned with the position of people with disabilities and the elderly under the program and I should say that these people would have been completely forgotten if the European Parliament had not thoroughly discussed their problems. There are several other groups that need to be strengthened, but mainly here are the Member States that make funding. I know, for example, a Member State who wants to use a significant part of the whole program for a single group, the refugees. I would like to call the commissioner to secure a balance between the various groups. It is unacceptable to decide a Member State, citing the principle of supplementary, the allocation of all resources in a single group. I believe that this issue should be addressed strictly, otherwise what Mr Meijer warned us, that is to say, gain interests will be created, and everyone will believe that these resources belong to him. This would be a big mistake! The resources should be distributed again. They should boost innovative plans and not disappear in the Finance Ministries. Let's not forget this, that would be unacceptable. I believe that the other problems we discussed in parliament in the context of this issue and are largely due to the fact that it is so difficult to find a proper balance, are not insurmountable. I hope the European Commission accepts the compromise that the parliament ended with and which is mainly aimed at finding a balance. For this reason, as the situation is, of course, a bit difficult, Parliament has decided to wait for the time on the Equal program, and for the sake of ease and security, so that it can then make an opinion on the best way the funding can be made. I think he did the right to parliament. Its position in the whole process is certainly a bit unclear. Nor is the internal regulation clear at this point, and that is why I say that we did very well by not making a definitive decision on the issue.	el
"I remind you that our Parliament requires credits of 850 million ECU, which is not enormous in the community budget, and that the current proposals are 613 million ECU.In any case, it seems to me that at least for the end of the application of Life, there would be a means that the Union will make a significant budgetary gesture in favor of the environment.Let me finish on the question of the operating mode of our institutions.The speech that I hear today is: ""It is absolutely necessary that we can now conclude quickly. Clearly, you, parliament, lower your claims, in particular your budgetary claims! Because, if we do not arrive quickly, in the context of codecision, to fix the framework of the LIFE regulation, we will be late in its implementation for the year 2000, and it is true thatWait for our credits.If you want to be reasonable, we must accept our position because, in codecision, we do not have time. ""I believe that our parliament often protests against this method, which does not question anyone, specifically, within the council and I certainly would not want the Portuguese presidency to feel the accounting of this fact, since in reality it is a bit of a tradition.Environmental question, the budgetary question is central and that the Parliament cannot give in to blackmail which would require it to be the only reasonable in this case.President, Gentlemen deputies, it is true that we openly disapprove of some of the options taken by the Council and the Commission.And I will have the opportunity to dwell on it later.However, it must be recognized, to begin with, that these regulations are better than the LIFE I and LIFE II regulations.First, because the basic proposal made Life more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.Then, because the common position incorporates certain essential aspects defended by the European Parliament at first reading, in particular the fact of retaining the promotion of employment as a criterion for selecting projects and the reduction of the overall impact of products from their production to their recycling and elimination, as a ""environment"" objective."	fr
Are there any objections to the protocols?(Parliament approves the protocols.) Mrs. President!I always care for the opening of the session on Mondays in the afternoon at 5 a.m.Yesterday, like many European MPs, I was impossible to participate, since Air France's flight, with which we normally arrive here at a quarter after two, was canceled by the airline without any reason.So we could come very late.If Air France keeps this boycott policy to the European Parliament, the parliament would have to take measures to prevent this from happening again.Thank you very much, Mr. Medina Ortega.I regret this as well as you.Would you be so friendly and send me this in writing so that I can contact Air France and the French government with the concrete details?I think that is really no longer acceptable, and we have to protest with all the reprint.Ms. President, I did the same yesterday as my colleague Medina Ortega.In my opinion, the French authorities - who are honored to accommodate the seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility for the guarantee of reasonable connections to all capitals of the Union.In any case, Mr. Napolitano, I thank you.Ms. President, I am not concerned with having aircraft delays, but I would like to ask to apologize yesterday's lack of my colleague Caroline Lucas from the Greens' parliamentary group, the British MP.She couldn't be here because yesterday morning she was arrested on an anti -nome demonstration in Glasgow.Her identity was determined, and although it was clearly demonstrable that she was a member of the European MP, she was held all day long.In my opinion, this is completely intolerable.I would therefore like to ask you - I have already sent you a corresponding letter together with my colleague Haitala - to urge the British authorities to do so that such incidents do not repeat and that one apologizes to Ms. Lucas.Thank you, Mr. Lannoye.I received your letter and have already imagined British representation.Ms. President, I would like to ask for something with regard to the coordination today that I did yesterday in the oral pronunciation for the Equal report.I ask for a shift in voting on the community initiative equal because we just need a little time to negotiate an important point.I am optimistic and really look forward to the coordination with serenity and confidence;We will find a broadest possible consent for this statement on Equal.We only need a little time to work out details related to the asylum question, and I therefore ask you to make the vote instead this morning.Ms. President, I would like to say something else about what Mr. Lannoye spoke to: Ms. Lucas was arrested on the edge of Glasgow because she protested against the Trident base in Faslane.My sympathy belongs to this protest.With Ms. Lucas, who tries to hide behind her parliamentary immunity, I cannot explain myself in solidarity.I was also arrested because I protested in Faslane.I didn't hide behind any immunity.	de
We know what happened recently in the United Nations General Assembly.We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or we risk seeing an approved resolution comprising absolutely unacceptable arguments claiming that human rights are not valid and applicable on a universal scale.The New York scene is different from that of Geneva.Last year's debate on sovereignty and humanitarian aid, which was held in New York, dealt with such a sensitive theme that he influenced all the other subjects.He certainly influenced the debate relating to the moratorium on capital punishment.The Geneva debate focuses more, however, on human rights.It may therefore be that we are more likely to make progress there.Second, Cuba.I want to approach this point directly by what we Europeans are the subject of unjustified criticism;We are indeed accused of not taking human rights sufficiently seriously.We are very concerned about certain gestures of the Cuban government last year, which even more reduced the freedom of citizens, gestures such as changes in the penal code and the scope of capital punishment.We also worry about the recent increase in the number of political detentions.We monitor the human rights situation through reports provided by NGOs and the activities of our human rights working groups based in EU Embassies in Havana.We have regularly expressed our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and parliament did the same.But I do not think that trying to isolate Cuba constitutes the adequate approach.We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a country that respects market principles, the inviolability of contracts and the rule of law.We want to encourage a transitional process towards democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.My point of view is absolutely identical with regard to the third subject I would like to approach, namely China.It's very simple, I want us to have relationships with China.It would be too easy and it would go in the opposite direction to the desired goal than to want something else, and that would be an insult to more than a fifth of humanity.I also want to see China transformed by a peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not throw into prison activists of democracy or religious followers.So what should we do?Of course, we have to maintain enthusiastic trade relations with China and hope to be able to welcome this country within the WTO under reasonable conditions.It is really poorly appropriate to talk about a world trade organization that does not understand China - or even Russia elsewhere.But I do not think today, and I never thought it, that our emerging economic relations with China - which manifest themselves, for example, by the 25 billion euros in China excess vis -à -vis the European Union - should be silent when it comes to the situation of human rights in China.For me, the question is not to know if we must approach the question of human rights in China - we have the duty and have a legitimate interest for this question - but rather what is the best way to do it.	fr
"I hope that this report is another important step in this direction, and that is why I want to thank the rapporteur, Member of the Parliament Myller, for his valuable work. The Gothenburg minutes are step forward. However, it is not nearly sufficient. Only the goal of the previously agreed acidification is achieved by the minutes and the Council. A large number of people die early if we do not accept the measures proposed by the Commission. The protocol was approved in a procedure where the opposing bodies were not sufficiently pressured to do what they should do. We must not allow this to influence the community in that it differs from the agreed objectives. The costs of the Commission's proposal must be seen from the correct perspective, even a very pessimistic assessment of the Commission, which would not fully take into account kyoto commitments or other than technical solutions. They are only 0.08 % of the Community's GDP in 2010. Member States must take some of the actions that can reach the proposed emission limits at a lower cost if they intend to fulfill their kyoto commitment. If we say that the thresholds are too difficult to achieve, it is a concern to neglect kyoto commitments. Let us now look at the checks. The Commission may approve the reviews of 3, 8, 9, 13, 19 and 21. We will draw a song on a song that does not restrict the Commission's right to take initiatives and is included in our revised proposal. We also include a reference to Article 9 of the Directive to make the new introductory section functional. As a result, the Commission does not accept the revision 27. The Commission's proposal is to be as flexible as possible towards Member States, but we cannot exclude additional activities in the community if they encourage Member States to achieve emission limits more cost -effectively. The Commission may also be partly approved by the revision 11 to make additional changes to Article 9. We agree that the legislative examination should take into account aircraft emissions, the reduction of emissions from the community, the actions taken in the candidate states and the factors related to traffic. However, the Commission cannot agree to propose deadlines in the report to Parliament and the Council. By 2003, the Commission has not received much information from the Member States to report and to decide on which it could be decided. In 2011, the Commission does not know whether the 2010 emission limits have been reached, as Member States must be given time to draw up surveys. We will partially accept the underlying principles of the review 12. Therefore, we will re -formatate Article 9 (3) so that it is included in the text of the proposed review. The Commission approves the principles of the review 23. The reference to non-UN ECE processes must be restricted to states that have provided information and which are relevant to the impurities of the community. In principle, the Commission approves reviews of 24, 25 and 26, and is also taken into account in the re -design of Article 9 as part of its revised proposal. The Commission is very compassionate about the underlying concerns of checks 16 and 17. We should make a concession based on the fact that smaller Member States have less space to diversify the load. However, this is about cross -border pollution, so the Commission considers that the emission limits of individual Member States can only be adapted as part of the general re -examination of the emission limits. Therefore, we propose a new paragraph of the introductory and changes to Article 9 to ensure that the effects of smaller Member States are properly taken into account in the re-examination. The Commission may approve the check of 20 parts of the check, which adds the word ""appropriate"" to the introductory section 9. We do not accept the check in 20 other respects. The Commission is unable to approve checks 15, 28, 29 and 32. They aim to compensate the emission limits to meet the agreed Community goals of the Community of the Gothenburg Protocol."	fi
In this area, coordination is the keyword.The water problem is always more topical.Climate change, small temperature increases have direct influence on precipitation.Some regions dry up, many others become humid.It's time to act.In March, the second World Water Forum will take place in The Hague.This forum defends a global vision.This vision must lead to regional action plans for sustainable water management.For the European Parliament, the time to act has now come.We must opt ​​for a sustainable policy in the field of water and, at the same time, we must be realistic.But we cannot fix the bar too low either.The common position is not ambitious enough.This is why it is essential to use previous international conventions or to OSPAR objectives.We must tend to the gradual abolition of dangerous products in 2020. It is understood for the marine environment.It is obvious that this agreement must also be worth for other waters.OSPAR objectives are being developed.A list of 400 products that have obvious dangers for the environment has been established.Both technical and economic levels, it is possible to approach the zero level in terms of emissions from these substances and this is the choice that we must make.Naturally, the directive must also be restrictive.Downstream countries must be able to count that upstream countries respect the qualitative objectives.Quality has a price but pollution can prove to have a price much higher than the future.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner!I would like to express my deep admiration for the remarkable work carried out by Ms. Lienemann about this directive on water.Let me remember that the most serious environmental problems we find ourselves today - the transformation of climates, the devastation of virgin forests, the exhaustion of fishing resources - always touch on resources that we have in common and which are absolutely essential to us, but which, in a way, are also without master.Let us also recognize that one can say soft waters of the European continent that their property is in an area of ​​blur, between what belongs to all and what does not belong to anyone.This is the reason why establishing responsibilities in this area is of strategic importance.It is also essential that the different rivers are considered global, treated as a whole that they actually constitute, whatever the country to which belongs such or such part of their common route.Dear colleagues, as has already been said several times, the proposal for a directive actually represents a historic chance of simplifying and improving the plethora and the real mosaic of EU regulations and directives and thus reaching a high level of environmental protection in Europe.However, I have the impression that the policy of the framework directive on water is imbued with deregulation and renationalization.I also hope that the vote will not be a blow in the water and two points are quite essential for me in this regard.First Oscar.We know that the commission's proposal is not far enough;Unfortunately, the same goes for the environmental committee proposal.	fr
"Unfortunately not everyone understands the matter in this way, but it is considered that there is an unjustified in my opinion, contradiction between women and family rights, which we attempt to regulate by rejecting the family, rather than looking for a radical new type and equal European policy. In this way the values ​​of the family end up in society in the wrong hands, or at least in the hands of one side. The new far -right states that its values ​​belong and with their help it reaches the culmination of moral self -satisfaction. That is why it causes a boredom of many. However, I think it would be a big mistake for the European Parliament to accept this development. The family is inextricably linked to the European perception of society. Like many others, the Christian Democrats want a society where freedom and responsibility will coexist. I think this is a family society, because learning collective responsibility and solidarity is difficult if it is not learned in the small closest community. Society may be fair, but it can never love. Her embrace is too cold for this and her hands are too close. Nevertheless, this love is a prerequisite for the development of a healthy person. Nor will Europe have any benefit from progressive fundamental rights if members of society will not want their respect. The socialization that requires this is constantly done within the family. There is therefore no Europe of peoples without Europe of families. The family needs recognition, encouragement and freedom of action in its work, and even protection against the arbitrariness of society, just like individuals. In this regard, the rights and protection of the family must be repeated on the map of fundamental rights of the European Union and have been established elsewhere. It is clear that there is a great fear of many people, especially those who elected me, may this map override national constitutions, especially in support and protection of fundamental institutions such as family, marriage and the protection of the life of born and unborn people. It is good to remember that Europe maintains the same common position in its whole history in terms of the importance of supporting and protecting family and marriage. These institutions are preserved by the constitutions of all our states, as well as by the constitutions of the candidates for the integration of countries that will become members of the European Union by enlargement. I can show you the constitutions of post-communist states, in which the institution of family and marriage is protected. I welcome our map reference to family life. Article 9, Section 1, states that: ""Everyone has the right to have a family"". He says he is inspired by Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which stipulates that ""men and women in marriage have the right to marry and have a family in accordance with state laws"". Society recognizes marriage not for ethics, but because it recognizes, based on rational criteria, the stability it offers to society both socially and economically and because it ensures future generations."	el
First of all, it is essential to encourage private investment.The union must help stimulate business spirit and create jobs in this way, but we must not forget public investment.This has been the great victim of recent years and an improvement in public finances must clearly allow us to improve public investment, however respecting our commitments in terms of tax consolidation.Our big bet for the future must be research and development, but also human capital.These are two of the great challenges that we will have to take up in Lisbon.We believe that it is fundamental to progress in these challenges with quantified objectives, specific definitions allowing us ultimately to achieve what we all aspire: net improvements of productivity which make possible increased growth in our society, as well as an increase in employment which makes it possible to regain part of the land lost in recent years.It is the policy that the Commission has defended and that we will continue to defend in Lisbon.Common Fisheries Policy (PCP) The agenda calls in common the following reports: A5-0038/2000 of Ms. ATTWooll, on behalf of the Fisheries Commission, on the proposal for the settlement of the Council establishing a community framework for the collection and management of fishery data essential to the conduct of the common fishery policy (COM (1999) 0541 -C5-0302/1999 -1999/0218 (CNS));A5-0037/2000 of Ms. Attwooll, on behalf of the Fisheries Commission, on the proposal for the decision of the Council relating to a financial participation of the Community in the expenses made by the Member States for data collection, as well as the financing of studies and pilot projects in support of the common fisheries policy (COM (1999) 0551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224 (CNS)).The proposals for the settlement of the Council for the collection and management of fishery data and decision of the Council relating to a financial contribution in this area are both to be welcomed.Hence this common debate, since each of them can only be fully understood in the light of the other.I understand that their development lasted about five years.It is important that rapid progress is now made, in view of the revision of the common fishing policy in 2002. Let us first take the proposal for the settlement of the Council.This requires member states to collect a wider range of fishery data that it was not required under the previous regulations.Both biological and economic information is included.The proposal also requires member states to produce such data in aggregate form.An application regulations will specify exactly what new data must be collected and which of them must be aggregated with existing data.The application regulations will establish a minimum community program and an extended community program.It seems that these programs will not cover the whole spectrum of potential data but will be selective, for example depending on the stocks of fish.The Council's decision -making proposal allows the establishment of a financial contribution granted by the community to the Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	fr
"We will receive all the designs of the implementation measures that are forwarded to a committee at the same time as this committee.We will have the opportunity to examine the designs, to discuss it and to ask questions.However, we will only be able to officially intervene at the Commission if we believe that this has exceeded the implementation powers transferred to it.In other words, we can take action against a implementation measure in which the commission's powers are exceeded, but we have no influence with regard to the content of this measure.In a democracy, however, Parliament should also have the opportunity to question the content.We don't intend to do that all the time.We do not want to interfere with the implementation decisions, but it is a democratic security measure that we have this option in the few cases in which this seems absolutely necessary.This option is missing in the new system or is at least only partially available.Our fourth point of criticism is that a implementation measure that has been blocked in the comitology process is not referred to both legislative organs, but only to the council, which has the right to develop an alternative measure.This is not correct.Both organs - the Council and Parliament - adopt the legal provisions through which the Commission transfers implementation powers.If implementation measures are referred to, this should not only be done to an organ, but both.Overall, some improvements have been achieved by this system.The additional aspects that result from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but they do not change the fundamental decision of the Council.Even here we voluntarily - this did not happen automatically - to do without the Plumb/Delors agreement as part of the entire compromise.We were ready to forego these provisions.We will have to pursue very precisely what was previously covered by this agreement, but is not fully covered by the new decision.We have to be very vigilant.So it is a step forward.My faction accepts this only reluctantly as a step forward.We are not as compromising as Ms. Frassoni.We see the limits and are certain that this topic will be on the agenda again in a few years.If we want a democratic union with the greatest possible transparency, we will have to deal with this topic again.President!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms. Frassoni, for the work done.Editing questions of comitology is never easy.Ms. Schleicher has dealt with a kind of ""committee magic"" that we always spoke of.Certainly the process has always been very complicated due to previous decisions that ultimately have to be rationalized.In my opinion, the agreement that we have reached between the Commission and Parliament represents a clear rationalization of the process. In our view, it is sufficient for the fundamental interests of parliament.Mr. Corbett has raised his concerns.He says that they have partially done and sometimes not.I would like to say that those who could clear the Commission have been cleared out.What Mr. Corbett addresses are other prerequisites that are not covered by the decision of the Council, but unfortunately we cannot go beyond."	de
The third point concerns the effort that the European Parliament must commit to performing - with the help of an equal representation group at the Assembly of Equal Representation - with the aim of stabilizing the budgets of the ACC countries, through a specific selection of budget positions, which will enable themselves to budget,politicians, which may apply to the ACP countries. We must favor the peoples of the ACP countries by approaching their rulers, who must be fully aware that the aid for the development on the part of the European Union are intended for the peoples and not for any oligarchs that in some countries manage all internal and external resources. And finally, the fourth point: Prevention of transnational conflicts and conflicts between states must be our constant concern and could, to some extent, be achieved both through a strong and valid diplomatic campaign and with the proposals I expressed. Mr President, I subscribe to the positive evaluation of the report that my partner Karin Junker recently made and I will add that Mr Corrie began his work as a co-chair of the Assembly of equal ACE-EU representation with an effective and impartial attitude that we must fully recognize. My speech will be limited to a particular event that happened a few days ago, partly as a consequence of the facts mentioned in the report we are discussing here. I am referring to the intention expressed by Cuba on February 2 to be integrated as a full -right member in the ACP group. At the last meeting of the ACE-EU representation convention in Nassau, a Cuban delegation attended and appeared before the plenary, the Vice-Chancellor Dalmau, with whom there was a lively discussion, followed by numerous conversations with many of us. After Nassau, a delegation of our parliament, led by Mr Corrie himself and the Chairman of the Development and Cooperation Committee, Joaquin Mirada, visited Havana, contributing to the exchange of a series of well -crystallized views. I have the impression that this mission of the European Parliament was the final push that persuaded our Cuban friends of how appropriate it is to make a step forward in the mechanisms of cooperation with the European Union. We are in a state of notable political importance and I hope the European Parliament will encourage the relevant favorable view and a generous attitude on the part of the Union, which means a positive response as soon as possible. This will be important, for at least three reasons. It will first be for Cuba, for the development and prosperity of its people, and to permanently break the embargo imposed by the United States, which was repeatedly condemned by the European Parliament and the United Nations. Secondly, we must keep in mind that Cuba's candidacy was supported by all ACP countries. If the European Union has a positive response to the proposal of the affiliated with us, we will give a sample of respect and appreciation to the relevant reasons, which will have a positive impact on the whole context of our cooperation with them. Nor can the value of a decision such as the one I propose can be ignored as proof of the consistency and autonomy of the European Union and its non -submission to any pressure.	el
It is therefore absurd and often impossible to transmit Life projects directly to another instrument.If we were to seek for each project other financing proposals, this would also require greater resources than those available in the current situation.Now that the Commission must assess with precision what resources are necessary for each action, it is an example of non -central action, but requiring considerable resources that we must avoid.The Commission cannot accept amendment 14 either, which disagrees with the right of initiative of the Commission.Regarding the discussion on the deadline, I would like to say that we must now advance the deadline for the entry into force of Life, fixed for March 31, 2000 in the common position.It will be fixed as soon as these regulations are adopted.To conclude, I would like to repeat that I am convinced that Life will become an effective instrument in the context of development support and the implementation of a common environmental policy.Parliament has contributed to a large extent to the improvement of this instrument.I am convinced that you share my desire to see the regulations adopted as soon as possible, in particular if one thinks of the major hopes of the Member States and other countries, especially among the candidate countries which now have the possibility of participating in Life.Thank you, Madame Wallström.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:30 am.Modernization of social protection The agenda calls for the report (A5-0033/2000) of Mr. Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication of the Commission relating to a concerted strategy to modernize social protection (COM (1999) 347 - C5 - 0253/1999 - 1999/2182 (COS)).primordial.It is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.It is based on monetary cooperation, which has since been followed by macroeconomic cooperation and cooperation at the employment policy.The logical rest is now to develop the social protection system.These areas are interdependent.Economic stability is a basis for progress and lead to a high employment rate.It also offers the possibility of developing well-being.The opposite is also valid: a well -developed policy in terms of social protection can contribute to an increase in employment and growth.Social protection is, in other words, a productive factor.There are differences within the EU at the level of the social protection system.Many of them stem from history.However, we now have a number of common challenges to be met.This is particularly the case for demographic evolution which does not only concern the fact that the number of elderly people increases, but also that the number of births decreases.The job market also changes.Women find themselves largely on the job market.Technical evolution is another challenge.We have to go to the front of these challenges together.	fr
For all of these reasons, I voted for the report and now expect the Commission to respond to our expectations and demands.(The session is interrupted at 1:05 p.m. and re -accepted at 3 p.m.The word has the word on behalf of the Commission Ms. de Palacio to open the pronunciation.Mr. President, I speak on behalf of the PPE, but also as a Breton MP, who is directly affected and shocked by these events.Together with Françoise Grossetête and the PPE, we brought in a draft decision.Fortunately, we now have a compromise proposal.The ancient of the tanker Erika is indeed a European affair, on the one hand because this affects some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, which is affected and polluted, which is serious consequences for tourism, the professional groups dependent on the sea, and on the other hand because it is in question.One can almost certainly say that such a disaster on the American coasts would not have been possible.Why?Because the Americans understood the teachings from the disaster of the Exxon Valdez, and because they passed the Oil Pollution Act in 1990, which on the one hand contains stricter liability provisions, because it can also be liable to liability, and on the other hand, and also thanks to different provisions and in particular the existence of the American coast guard.If we had such provisions, let me tell me again, the catastrophe would undoubtedly have been avoidable.Therefore, we believe that the relevant provisions have to be revised, especially the 1992 minutes, which the agenda, in specific cases, freed the owners of oil tankers from any responsibility.If the tutor is exempt from liability, he is of course less interested in the controls that are responsible for the oil companies.The provisions must therefore be revised, and I thank you, Ms. Commissioner, that you have pointed out all inadequaces currently available in the European provisions.Above all, as you said, we have to reinforce the controls against both the flag state and the ship classification societies.According to her, the Rina is a Italian ship classification register recognized by the Commission.How does this recognition take place?Which reliability criteria are there?You will send a mission.We expect the results with great interest.You also have to reinforce the controls of the seafaring authorities, the controls in the European ports.As is well known, there is a Memorandum of Paris that provides for a minimum of control that a quarter of the European ports that start the European ports must be controlled by the seafaring authorities of the relevant country.However, this obligation is not met, not in France and not in numerous other European countries.Why?What consequences did the Commission draw from it or intends to draw it from it?It also seems necessary to me to reinforce control that is the responsibility of the questioner in this case of the oil company.When it comes to your financial responsibility, control will undoubtedly be a little more thorough.	de
I have heard a lot of remarks about the Commission's statement that raised all the above questions and dealing with very thoroughly. It also introduced sketches of new articles, but no one has claimed that we would have exceeded the authorized authority in Helsinki. Thus, this is proof that if we follow those powers from the word word and utilize all the suggestions it contains, we can get to the core of things. I think Minister Seixas da Costa agrees with the European Parliament's involvement in the work of the conference, as we have common experiences, so I would say that you do the wrong thing if you ignore the reflection and negotiating group, where two of your representatives, Professor Tsatsos and member Elmar Brok, will work. Of course, we agree on the last remaining issues, as always when it comes to negotiations on institutions, and I believe that this is a good arrangement of the Council and especially of the States and Governments, in which the success of that conference is to the Council. By the way, I would point out here that the Commission chairman, Prodi, will attend that council meeting and that he plans to take advantage of his position, especially in the final stages of the negotiations. However, the Council must prepare carefully. Therefore, we do not have to, good members of the Parliament, ignore that preparatory and finishing work, because I know, based on the experience gained in Amsterdam, that it has an important and useful meaning and does not satisfy the technical clarification alone. I believe that the personal representatives of the foreign ministers, your two representatives and as a representative of the Commission, we will be at the heart of the affairs, but the last questions left must be agreed later, in other forums we also participate. Good members of the Parliament, not only the position of negotiators, but the content of their speeches is important at the conference. I would now like to remind me, based on the pre -Amsterdam experiences, once again in Parliament, that no matter how vague or incomplete the status of the European Parliament was granted, the content of the members Guigou and Brok speeches played a major role in those negotiations. I am convinced that the same goes for the future, and for my part and my position, with the power of Finland, I intend to ensure that the thoughts presented by two of your representatives will be listened to and that they are taken into account throughout the negotiations. I am sure that the European Parliament and the Commission does not have to settle for the position of the bystander in the negotiations. Good Members of the Parliament, we are now very interested in your final statement, where you clarify the primary tasks and concrete proposals for the European Parliament for negotiations. It is very important that both European institutions, that is, the Commission and the European Parliament, are clearly and regularly informed by the members of the Council, and regularly to the Citizens of the Union of the challenges of that conference and the solutions we recommend as representatives of European institutions, who are responsible for ensuring that the extended Union will work properly. The good members of the Parliament, the Commission, intends to work in close cooperation and good harmony in the next few months with both of your representatives, Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, so that we can bring to our point of view when needed. Our opinions and positions probably do not always go together, and there are no doubt, but it is quite common. It is now important to achieve some unity, and I am committed to the effort to achieve that unity right from my college. Therefore, we have both the desire and the ambition to reach the same wavelength in dealing with many different topics and raise the level of negotiations. Negotiations are no coincidence, because I repeat this we have set similar goals for them and we all think that they mean the moment of truth to the European Union.	fi
I would like to make two comments about the reports we have before us. The first concerns the Belder report, which includes a version of the amendment I have filed for the treatment of Russian -speaking minorities in Estonia and Latvia. I think it's worth including.15 years ago in Austria, Mr Eaider essentially pursued the Slovenian community of Austria. Very few of us wanted to get up and talk then. We need to tell the Estonians and the Latvians that if they continue to behave in this way, their prospects for joining the European Union are greatly reduced. Secondly, the Ludford report contains a series of amendments tabled by the Christian Democrats by redeeming a number of paragraphs originally in the Eurygei exhibition 15 years ago - and which the Christian Democrats had then approved - to amend the staff regulations, in order to allow members of the European Community. Regarding the voting rights and the selection of candidates from national minorities, what I do not understand is whether they do not have political memory or whether, and this would be more serious, their political position has changed. Madam President, I and my team are enthusiastically supporting Mr Haarder's report on human rights because we have found that it has a very good line but there are also many other reasons for our support. My team and I, however, have very large doubts about the Ludford report, because on the pretext of fighting racism and xenophobia, many political measures are discussed that have nothing to do with analysis and do not belong to this report. This is, of course, in parallel with a multitude of other measures that we will definitely support. I will tell you the points we do not accept and the reasons for their rejection. These are points outside the 1997/98 period, which is being examined by the exhibition. Sarah Ludford should have divine abilities, since it claims that the exhibition is considering 2000, since this year is still ahead of us. Secondly, we turn against all those points against solidarity. Colleague Nassauer has already pointed out that the report is calling for interventions in civil servants law. In this case, the author should be asked if she has ever attempted to stand on her feet as a civil servant for example in Morocco. Anything in a Member State regarding the recruitment of civil servants and police officers is exclusively a matter of the Member State itself. Thirdly there are references to points that do not belong to the report, such as the right to vote for third -country nationals in the European elections or municipal elections. I find the last point very important. As an Austrian, I cannot accept an exhibition that is turning against my country, Austria, in a unjustified and unjustified manner, which explicitly welcomes and supports an action, due to party -political incentives as well as the unjustified measures. These are measures that are ultimately against youth, economics, sports and against the population of my homeland of Austria. This has no place in the report.	el
We know that you have had a significant part of it. I was also pleased that today you mentioned Mozambique in this context and the fact that a lot of humanitarian help can be provided within these tools. Of course, we cannot talk about foreign policy without mentioning spectacle. My friend Jacques Poos later speaks for our group on this issue. I want to focus on Kosovo. The situation in Kosovo clearly shows that it is not possible to find a sustainable solution to the crisis by military means. The contribution of Kor troops has been, and still, is important and immeasurably valuable, but in the long run we cannot solve political problems and ethnic conflicts through tanks and firearms. The situation has gone so far that Pentagon has forbidden American troops to return to the northern part of Mitrovica. They have now been replaced by strong Danish, Finns and Swedish troops. It is easy to lose hope in the face of violence and anger, but it is important for Kosovo, Balkans and Europe that we do not fail. The Stability Agreement obliges us to take significant action. This is therefore affecting the credibility of the common foreign and security policy of the Union. There is currently a huge shortage of appropriate staff in Kosovo. Already in the fall, we heard that Bernard Kouchner demanded civilian police. I was delighted to hear that high representative Javier Solana intends to invite Interior Ministers to discuss the police issue at the weekend. I hope that this debate will primarily apply to Kosovo to correct this desperate situation. In the case of Kosovo and Balkan, I also hope that the Council will comply with the claim made by the Parliament and, as far as I understand, the demand for the multi -year appropriations for the construction of Kosovo Peace. Mr. High Representative Solan, we have learned a lot about the situation in Kosovo, for example, that we acquire military power for crisis management, which has already been implemented at a practical level. However, the second, at least as important teaching, is that preventing a crisis is a better option than having to deal with the crisis after its onset. Therefore, the EU must also be able to prevent conflicts independently and credibly. Commission member Patten has taken several commendable initiatives in this way. I mean a proposal that concerns readiness for a quick response and the establishment of a quick response for troops for non-military operations, and the introduction of the main goals in non-military stakes and the Commission Crisis Center. My last question high representative for Javier Solana is: What concrete preparations are made to prevent conflicts? How are they organized a high representative in the Solana Chancellery and how has the activity coordinated with the Commission? The Mr President, the Mr President Solan, the Liberal Group supports you and trusts you fully, but we would still remind you of the huge responsibility you now have on your shoulders. On the other hand, I think of important humanitarian actions, peacekeeping and re -return measures ahead. On the other hand, I also think that you are responsible for the fact that the new European defense cooperation will not cause any disagreement in the relationship between NATO and the EU, the United States and Europe. Such disagreements would only be useful to states that threaten freedom and human rights. I believe that you heard the worries that some of the US congress members brought to the Parliament last week. Dear high representative of Sorana, you have to fade away these worries. For just as you have said, we can do something only if the EU and the United States hold one. If we have disagreements, they will weaken us, and it extends the suffering of the oppressed. Therefore, the highly high representative of Sorana, keep as closely as possible to our American ally, do not forget Norway, Turkey and Canada. You also have a heavy partial responsibility for not being a paper tiger.	fi
In the future, pensioners will have huge amounts of money already - already - this is the case. When young people are pennantless, the elderly have raised money, and because they want to benefit, they are very interested in this directive. If national governments had a heart - like the European Union to multiply the money earned in this directive - the problem of the pension bomb would have already been resolved. Good Commission member in Bolkeste, you have a great responsibility for the future of the elderly and pensioners, the future that I hope will become better when this Directive has been finished, that is, very soon, as colleagues Villiers and Kauppi have suggested..(NL) Mr President, I can first congratulate the commissioner Olle Schmid, and Members of the Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs and the rapporteur Brian Crowley and members of the Legal and Internal Market Affairs, which I would like to thank for their thorough and significant work to improve and expand their proposals. In the field of mutual funds, a long way has passed since the approval of Directive 85/611, and it is now important to reform the provisions. New proposals aim to maintain the protection of investors at the highest possible level, which is an absolute prerequisite for the entry into force of the euro for the next market integration. As the average European family invests their savings in mutual funds, proposals include cautious management provisions and, as I want to emphasize cautious management of investment policy and risks. These two proposals form a uniform whole. The first proposal adds the number of instruments to which the joint investment company can invest. These companies, as already stated here, are one of the largest players in the modern capital market. Their presence offers a larger number of ordinary investors the opportunity to take part in these markets, which takes into account the appropriately supervised principle of risk diversification. Because different forms of investment are allowed, individual investors may also benefit all benefits of new investment techniques. The second proposal expands the role that these important caring bodies can play in the European Union's capital market in connection with the development of mutual funds. By setting up branch departments and providing certain services to operate on a cross -border basis, these bodies can finally benefit from the freedoms of the Rome agreement that they have not benefited from all these years. The Commission has a positive attitude towards many clarifications proposed by the Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs and includes a large number of ideas presented by a committee. The Commission approves the reviews submitted to the first proposal and I will use the last amended numbers 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 and the second proposal for 23, 28 and 32, as they are indeed very useful for clarification and improvements. In addition, I appreciate those thoughts but amended in reviews 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20. I can also accept the idea of ​​the second paragraph 47. All the checks I just mentioned are related to the first proposal. As for the second proposal, checks 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 of the thoughts, and some parts of the check 27 that contain rational presentations can be accepted in a modified format. The Commission proposes to accept the content of these checks with certain changes to the formatting. In addition, I take into account the Committee on Economic Affairs to codify the entire text when approved for this is mentioned in the first proposal review 7 and the second proposal review 22. However, I cannot accept the formation of the reasoning as such. The Commission also believes that a number of amendments proposed by the Committee on Economic and Financial Affairs would thoroughly change the content of the first proposal.	fi
"I will only mention here wine and other goods produced in Golan and in the occupied territories.Peace reigns in Palestine and Israel.The credibility and respect for the legality of the treaties and agreements are essential if the European Union and the Parliament intend to play an active political role.Israel is sure that Europe is favorable to the security and stability of its state, but cannot ask us to be the accomplices of such serious violations.Palestinians know that the European Union supports the assertion of their state and their rights, but they must have confirmation.Peace is not built on the violation of rights.Some Israelis, such as the soldier Igal Moshe who refused four days ago to leave for Lebanon and who is today in prison, and some Palestinians, like those who have been refugees for fifty years and who, despite the demolition of their house and their lives, wish peace, are of the same opinion.It is above all respect for ourselves and the democratic rules that we have given ourselves asking us.Let me say, more prosaically, that it also concerns the loss of income of European citizens arising from this violation of human and economic rights.Mr. President, Messrs deputies, Madam MP Morgantini, the questions that the Commission has formulated relate to any illegal exports to the European community of products from the Israeli colonies or occupied territories benefiting from a preferential treatment and therefore, they call into question the correct application of the rules of preferential origin.The Commission has also already given a written answer to a question from the deputy on this subject in January 2000. But Madam MP wishes to obtain additional information.So I'm going to strive to provide them.First, when you refer to the lack of clarity of the agreement, I can tell you that the provisional agreement on trade and related matters between the European Community and Israel specifies that it applies to the territory of the member states of the European Community and, I quote, ""to the territory of Israel"".And that, consequently, in the perspective of the European Union, it is quite clear, in view of the details set out in the written response of Commissioner Christopher Patten, which I will read you in the original language: ""... as communication already explains, the community cannot consider Israeli settlements or occupied territories as part of Israeli territory for the implementation ofThis \ Israel. This is a very sensitive question because it relates to the broader question of borders, the Israelis and the Palestinians ""we have many times expressed this position to the authorities of Israel during all the official meetings between the Commission and the Israeli Minister, the most recent dating of January 21, on the occasion of which Prime Minister Shimon Peres s'Commissioner Christopher Patten.And as Madame the MP has just reported, it is noted that the interpretation of Israel as to the field of territorial application of the agreement does not coincide with the interpretation of the European Union, but, with the optics of the Commission, our interpretation does not present ambiguity."	fr
I also believe that it is important that no one can and should not deny the European Parliament or its committees to find out about something. Moral, discipline and restraint must be characterized by parliamentary members when they perform the tasks assigned to them, which of course cannot be prescribed. I would like to emphasize that there is no common European legal system, but that each Member State has its own separate legal system. There is a risk that the same values ​​are sent to the consideration, which will then be imposed on a different penalty. I agree with the launch of the investigation system, but I am also deeply convinced that the right to defense must be recognized as an equal and yet equally necessary right. I do not agree with the view that European community officials should be prosecuted extremely easily and simply: reporting is no longer a method for the 21st century. Finally, the Mr President, I believe that the principle of democracy must start with Parliament: there must be reforms that increase and expand the powers of the parliament and not diminish. This discussion on the report of the rapporteur Van Hulten will return to our minds the strict discussion that took place in one of the most difficult phase of the Union's institutions in the history that began in 1957. Refusal of the European Parliament to grant discharge and the final rejection of the 1996 budget;A distrust of the Parliament a year ago by many reasons;And the first report on the reform of the Independent Committee on Experts, which led to the mass separation of the Commission members, is currently all part of the Union's cultural heritage. Those of us who were involved in these historical events will probably remember well that no of these upheavals would have happened if we had not used our parliamentary power to make changes in the Commission's practices. Do not forget that the Council of Ministers, which is not present today, to discuss with us accepted discharge for 1997, not for 1996 on the same day as the Commission resigned on March 15th. Now is the second story of the Independent Expert Committee, which we got to know and briefly discussed last September. The biggest concern in our PPE party is to ensure that the public's confidence in the European Commission is restored. Additional measures to build a firm Europe will be wasted if European citizens consider that there is no appropriate system of democratic reporting obligation for over-enthusiastic officials. Under no circumstances, we will not give up what we have achieved in recent months, as we believe that we promote openness and transparency. Therefore, we consider it important that the Numerous Commission announcements presented by the Commission in recent weeks, which have made all kinds of political proposals, are quickly recorded in a white book. This would indicate the desire to proceed quickly, and it would also give the impression that the Commission is more in communication mode rather than in listening mode. Our concern is confirmed if the rumor that has been moving in recent days is true that the Commission would like to severely restrict the availability of information from parliamentary members. Ultimately, this was one of the reasons that led to the resignation of the previous Commission. Isn't it learned? The knowledge that the framework between the European Parliament and the Commission still need additional negotiations led to disagreement with the rapporteur when we discussed his report in the committee. We could not agree with his view that it would be reduced to Parliament to provide detailed instructions on what we want the Commission to bring out in its reform package. The more loose the resolutions are, the more looser, the more we give the Commission and your former colleagues in the Council to make the freedom as they wish. We believe that a significant number of recommendations in the Committee on Experts should be implemented. Like the PPE-de group, we have made all the recommendations of the Expert Committee to the committee and many of them are currently recorded in the report, so the nature of the Van Hulten report in the committee changed completely.	fi
I oppose amendments 7 to 13, which were resolutely rejected by the Fisheries Committee.Their content, mostly, is useless or is already mentioned in my text.In particular, I drew attention to the need to study the scope and the effects of the interaction between breeding salmon and wild salmon, the need to study the source of the AIS and the need to carry out wider tests on the presence of the virus within the stocks of wild fish.These amendments deposited by the green component of the Green Group/European Free Alliance aim to provide a justification for amendment 13. This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate, since it seeks not only to maintain the obligation of compulsory and immediate slaughter of all fish but it also aims to prevent any fish from an infected exploitation, whether sick or not,In accordance with current policy, no sick fish is sold.No proposal is made to change this situation and, as part of the new proposed regime, there is no question of selling sick fish.Amendments 7 to 13 simply do not take into account the reality demonstrated by the highly contrasting statistics provided by Scotland and Norway.In Scotland, we have undergone a draconian regime that has not achieved its objectives.In Norway, thanks to their longest experience, systematic and compulsory slaughter was abandoned a few years ago and a series of measures led to the situation improves dramatically.It is our interest in everyone that in Scotland, we can also contain the AIS and prevent the continuation of its spread.Last week, in Scotland, a joint working group on AIS, made up of government and sector representatives, published a report.This exhaustive document takes into account a wide range of possible risks and recommends carrying out action in order to attack it in areas such as site transmission, safety measures in order to reduce leaks, waste treatment and effluents, detection and diagnostic methods, low and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many other measures.Certain measures may be immediately applied - and will be applied - by local authorities by using existing powers and others will be included in practice codes.They will all be beneficial, not only with regard to AIS but also to identify better quality standards in aquaculture in general, where it is necessary.Dear colleagues, your vote in favor of my report as a whole and as adopted by the Fisheries Commission will constitute a significant part of a wider train of measures concerning the control of the AIS, based on the reality of the situation in Scotland and the lessons learned from the successes obtained by other countries.I congratulate Mr. Hudghton, I fully support his report and urgently invite the honorable deputies of the Parliament to do the same.As it has mentioned, fish exploitation constitutes a crucial source of jobs in the most remote parts of rural Scotland and, at a time when the rural regions of Scotland have suffered from the worst recession for more than a century, the aquaculture industry is essentially raising the rural economy on which several thousand jobs depend on or indirectly.As he mentioned, more than 85,000 tonnes of salmon are produced by Scottish farms in a sector which generates more than 800 million euros each year.	fr
"Besides, it becomes a reform of corporate tissue, which should not be prevented because there are slow bureaucratic methods or obstacles that prolong the plight of businesses when no other means is. Therefore, it is important to try to find a legal framework that adapts to the new demands of the global economy. This proposal for the regulation was not proposed by the Commission, but was presented by two Member States - Germany and Finland - in these matters, together with the Commission, under the right of initiative. According to the Commission, this regulation does not bring any substantial change to the text of the agreement. Already in 1981, the Commission had expressed its attitude to adopting a clear principle of uniqueness of bankruptcies. And this perspective was included in the Commission's proposals as a parallel liquidation procedure for companies. On the other hand, the 1995 Convention concludes the initiation of the secondary procedure and thus creates exceptional situations for the general rule that the Commission would like to choose. After the entry into force of the Amsterdam agreement, the Commission would therefore have preferred to accept a new text that would have confirmed the unique thesis specifically. However, I do not believe that this would be the right moment to question the reconciliation achieved by the 1995 Convention, which is based on negotiations that have lasted almost thirty years. As a result, the Commission refused to make its own proposal and was limited to centrally presenting its views on institutional issues. For this reason, the Commission also considered that it should not make a proposal to amend the regulation, although it would not want to omit the not expressing their views on the repairs to be dealt with. Thus, the Commission agrees on the reviews of the rapporteur Lechner 1, 2, 3 and 5. According to the procedure expressed in this Article. Thus, the Commission agrees on reviews of 3 and 4 - and thus also the revision proposed by the Civic Freedom and the Interior Committee. In contrast, it does not agree with reviews 1 and 2 on the term ""center of debtor's main interests"". In fact, the concept is fully defined in Article 3 of the recent decision regarding the center of the association or the collective person's main interests. For all other cases that have not been directly discussed, we should understand the reference stated in the introductory section 13. Much thanks, Member of the Commission Member, Vitorino. The discussion has ended. The vote will be made tomorrow at 11am.(The session ended at 00.05) Erika's sinking on the agenda is the following is the oral question of the Fisheries Committee (B5-0011/2000) by Varela Suanzes-Carpegna for the Erika tanker accident. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, Good Members of the Parliament, I would first like to say that it is thoughtful that the Commission member Fischler is present here today. Our President informed us yesterday that he would be absent due to problems related to the agenda. I think he has been considering it again and has done what has been characteristic of him: he has shown attentiveness and respect for the Parliament, as always, and thank him for that. Today, I am talking on behalf of the European Parliament Fisheries Committee in this Chamber and will again pay attention to the Erika tanker's shipwreck. Our committee - and as chairman of it - speaks for the second thing about two kinds of political aspects. First of all, we want to show the Commission, the Council and the Member States that Parliament cannot and does not want to forget this serious accident. Secondly, today we want to focus on one concrete aspect of this serious environmental disaster: its effects on fishing and aquaculture areas in these areas. All of this must undoubtedly be doubtful to take action to be taken quickly in order to remedy the damage and avoid them in the future."	fi
I think it was important that everyone has given particular importance to the role of the European Union in developmental policy on an international scale.All of them are determined, and that was the topic of today's pronunciation that the European Union inevitably has to reinforce the coherence of its individual to the development goals so that it can take on a more active and leading role internationally in development policy.I think in some requests to speak, it was also very clearly pointed out that this responsibility for the coherence of the political of the European Union is not only at the Council, the Commission and also not with the parliament.Rather, it must be the subject of concerted efforts, considerations and a legislative and institutional preparation, and this at both commission and on the council level and in the European Parliament itself. In addition, some MPs have made proposals for this, such as the establishment of an observation center or working group, which should monitor the measures of the individual policy fields in the special area of ​​development.In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that it is also important, because this was a focus in the program of the Portuguese presidency, to point out the explanation that it is necessary to grant developmental policy in connection with the other policies of the European Union and especially within the framework of their foreign policy.We consider this to be absolutely essential because we will not succeed in developing consistent measures in the area of ​​the coherence of the political, if we are unable to give developmental policy the importance that is due to it as an instrument for confirming the principles and values ​​that shape the image of Europe in the international system.For this, it may be necessary, as I said, to make a paradigm shift, to leave the post -colonial paradigm behind and to give development policy another European dimension.In this regard, I think (and in some requests to speak here too) that with the assumption of the new agreement that takes the place of the Lomé Agreement, an important instrument is available at a time when the concept of the partnership with suchTo renew south and to give it a new dynamic.I hear a certain frustration from many speeches for this debate.On behalf of the Commission, I presented you with an explanation that, in my view, contains useful background information for this discussion.We will provide more precise information about all the questions of coherence.This discussion is not new.We are currently working on it in the Commission, and when this work has ended, we will report on it because many have asked about the coherence report.I have no doubt that the political attention, which, as it has become clear in today's debate, is increasingly focused on these problems to give it to the Commission and the GD development to grant the highest priority on the agenda of the tasks of the coherence.	de
"There is also the possibility of obtaining information on the transparency of the Council's legislative work by email. The issue concerning the right to access the public to the Council documents is part of the provisions of Article 255 of the Treaty on the European Union, which sets a two -year period from the date of entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty to determine the Council the general principles and restrictions raised in the exercise of the right. We must realize that this particular provision of the Amsterdam Treaty provides the various institutions with the ability to regulate the ability to access their own documents. And we have to understand it, given the extremely delicate character of certain issues where areas of particular sensitivity are involved, such as the common foreign security policy and the area of ​​justice and internal affairs. It is necessary for this regulation to reflect the overall concern so that, without the rules of transparency, the concern of the concern of transparency in complete ineffectiveness of any project by the Council. Therefore, as I said, the above article provides for the establishment of specific provisions in the regulations of the European Parliament, the Council and the Commission, which will regulate access to the respective documents. This case is part of the general context of the rules of transparency of European institutions, the rules, which, in the conclusions of the latest European Helsinki Council, were defined as ""an important element in view of the Union's approach to citizens and increasing its effectiveness"". During the term of office of the Finnish Presidency there were significant steps in accessing the documents, with the introduction of modern information technologies, and in particular with the use of the Internet. A Council's decision was also issued regarding the upgrading of the information provided on the legislative activity and the registration of Council documents accessible to the public. As well as, according to the aforementioned decision - I say again:Today's presidency has followed this practice. As for the registration of Councils of the Council accessible to the public, this decision also provides for a report to the percentage of confidential documents and the issues to which they are referred to, with the exception of cases where the dissemination of information on a specific issue may endanger the protection of public interest, and private and private life,Confidentiality that a natural or legal person could request, which transmits any information contained in the document, or the confidentiality imposed under the law of the Member State who forwarded such information. The Portuguese presidency has already taken over the commitment to launch the work on the public's access to the documents and expressed its intention to entrust this case to the ""Friends of the Presidency"" group immediately after the Committee submitted the Commission to access the Commission."	el
We all know that the aforementioned contract has been the result of discussions that lasted for many years, which were very often difficult and painful, and that is why it is a compromise between the principles of universality and territoriality, that is, between the principles that constitute our different legal systems. The realization of the fact that the evolution of the global financial situation, and in particular the promotion of the internal market, may lead to an increasingly frequent resort to insolvency procedures, which often take on the character of cross -border processes, justifies that the union must be fulfilled,Insolvency will move on the basis of a set of joint legislative authorities and will provide guarantees for rapid execution. Good or bad, cases of businesses that declare bankruptcy will become increasingly common in our daily economic life. This phenomenon will, after all, be a factor in renewing business tissue, which should not be obstructed by the existence of time -consuming bureaucratic processes or obstacles, which extend the slow death of businesses that cease to be viable. Hence the need to try to establish a legal framework that is adapted to the new demands of the globalized economy. This proposal of the Regulation was not submitted by the Commission, but on a joint initiative of two Member States - Germany and Finland - under the right of the initiative that share the Member States with the Commission on these issues. The Commission estimates that this regulation does not bring about any substantial change in relation to the text text. Already in 1981, the Commission had taken a position in favor of the clear adoption of the principle of universality in bankruptcy cases. Based on the same spirit, after all, in the same perspective the Commission had submitted proposals in the context of a parallel procedure related to the liquidation of business. On the contrary, the 1995 Convention eventually leaves room for the movement of secondary procedures, thus shaping situations of exemption in the general rule that the Commission would wish to prevail. Therefore, after the entry into force of the Treaty of Amsterdam, the Commission would rather be approved by a new text, which would explicitly promote the principle of universality. Nevertheless, I do not think now is the right time to undergo a heresy the agreement on the occasion of the 1995 Convention, which, after all, marked the ending of a period of negotiations that lasted for about thirty years. Consequently, the Commission did not want to submit a specific proposal by focusing its observations on institutional matters. For the same reason, the Commission thinks that it is not appropriate to present a proposal for the amendment of the Rules of Procedure. He would, however, wish to express to the main Members of her opinion on the amendments tabled. The Commission therefore agrees with amendments no.1, 2, 3 and 5 submitted by the rapporteur, Mr. Lechner. On the contrary, it does not agree with amendment no.4. Indeed, the Commission believes that it would be preferable to support Parliament the amendment no.4 of the Committee on Liberties and Rights of Citizens to enable the Commission to amend the Rules of Procedures, assisting by a Regulatory Committee, in accordance with Article 5 of the EC/1999/468 Decision.	el
"In this case, Mr. President, we certainly have a decalogue.A whole series of problems have been cited but, except your respect, it seems that the Commission, in a way, dares not say ""it would be necessary to act"" for any of them.It seems to me that you have not insisted - and even too much in my opinion - than on a point, namely on the fact that little by little the objective that you consider priority is to dismantle ""superfluous"" activities.However, we are attentive, Mr. President, because we have experienced a crisis of confidence vis -à -vis the Commission and we counted on this commission - at least the majority of this Parliament - precisely so that, above all, the reform of the Commission is accompanied by a reinforcement, a new identity, an impression of being again led by an alert hand.Let us take the fact that the Commission wants to dismantle or propose to dismantle, not judging itself up to the task, for example the powers, which the treaty, of the execution of common policies, confers.What do we ask in a certain sense from a government?What do we ask this structure, so to speak, ambiguous and particular that is the European Community?It is good that common resources have a supranational government and that they are not delegated to the Member States or to BATs, as has happened in the past.I find that you submit the same menu to us, but in a more serious way, by limiting you, as you say, to the homework of some white paper, as you have offered us.I fear - even if you signal that no, Mr. President - that this does not translate into what certain countries have been thinking for years, that is to say that the Commission must be a good secretariat of the Council of Ministers.If this is the role that the Commission intends to assume the next five years, we, convinced federalists, are certain that it is not the right way to follow.We will challenge you and judge what the Commission intends to do.The reform is important but, if it leads to a deterioration, a reduction and a decrease in the supranational powers of the Commission, it will go from the future of European integration, of the future that the founding fathers had envisaged for the European Commission.As for the other points, Mr. President, I will raise for example that of economic and social policy.Certainly, the European social model is experiencing a serious crisis;Admittedly, unemployment constitutes, and it is no coincidence, a problem that none of our policies has managed to solve.But it is not certain that we will be able to solve unemployment by drawing up the list of problems we have spoken in the past, without having a clear vision, without proposal, that which makes it in Europe economies which move at one of the most sustained pace and which are, but it is not a coincidence, those which have managed to make the flexibility of the labor market and the company their number one objective."	fr
"It is for this reason that we cannot accept prompts for new surgery. An agreement has been concluded to check pensions in 2001. They should not be checked a day earlier. In addition, the development of costs is fully controlled in this regard. The Commission thus refrain from following this ideological approach, which cannot be accepted and made by statements that cause citizens' instability and uncertainty. I have referred to the Italian case, not only because the chairman knows it so well, but also because the community's own statistics (euro) show that the share of social expenses in Italy - which currently accounts for 25.9 percent - not only from 1990 since 1990 than the Community average (28.2 %), and significantly lower than the sovereign(30.8 %). The role of Europe: first and foremost, it must be emphasized that Europe rejects warfare as a tool for international conflicts;Only then can we discuss the ""military"" role of the Union. Agriculture and Health: Our view is different from the Commission. In our opinion, there are not consumers but citizens who want to nourish themselves with healthy foods, products that have not been produced with competitiveness, but with respect for health, quality and environmental respect, and besides, these issues are employment promotion..(Fr) Prodi's action and program proposals are very vague and do not mention the social issue again. Besides, this word seems to be forbidden in the Commission's vocabulary, while liberals and American references are rampant. R. Prodi reths the ""administration"" of the very controversial concept. This is disputed because it puts leadership in the democratic activity of democracy, and because it refers to the concept defined by the International Currency Fund, the ideological content of which is fully characterized by liberalism and monetarism. Sliding is not just semantic. The only logic that can be made when reading this document is the pursuit of a large market and the general dismantling of regulations, and this has nothing to do with the redesign of European politics desired by our countrymen. R. Prodi only speaks of ""mechanisms"" and ""structures"", but does not define any balanced project that meets the wishes of our peoples. The expansion is taken for granted, but if it is not decided on any social policy, common value and any of the union's cohesion and democratization-enhancing body, Europe may be just a common market area in the frame of general globalization. Finally, the benevolence of R. Prod's Austrian government in the name of excessive law (which, moreover, is by no means obliged to send a congratulatory message), would in itself justify the issue of a sentence..(FR) EU is uninhibited to announce its ambition. The Commission's five years aims to become a ""global player"" by ""demonstrating"" real leadership in the international arena "". The nature of the EU has not changed. From the very beginning, it has worked according to the will of some of the big finance and industrial groups and their interests. The Prod Commission now wants to change the EU so that it can lead the world together with the United States while it competes against it. This new imperialist policy is pushing for the reorganization of European and national institutions, the strengthening of the government, the increasing competition, the establishment of the European Army and the redistribution of financial instruments. And we have to be ashamed that we still dare to refer to the defense of a ""European social model"", because the more the EU fights against the United States, the more it becomes like it. We vote against these goals because we oppose this policy in Parliament and in the streets. The preparation of a European Charter of Fundamental Rights would be the only minor light in this policy, but again, there is no designed to apply it to European peoples and decide themselves democratically."	fi
I direct your attention to one thing: it is dangerous to sketch the entire government activity of the European Union from here.I would be clearly advocate of subsidiarity.In my opinion, if we are able to determine which is the area of ​​our government work.Incidentally, I believe that subsidiarity also deserves a consideration.It must not only be the Commission, our states, our parliaments and our civil society must be, which also think about them.Finally, I would like to briefly respond to the last goal that we think is absolutely fundamental: stabilizing the continent and strengthening the role of Europe in the world.Here I would say that there is a agreement and support with regard to the priority of Southeast Europe, with regard to the expansion and-I have already pointed out this-the integration process and the strengthening of the European Middle Means program as well as our ability to make conflict and with regard to a topic that is very little spoken of, the north-south challenge.We must not forget Africa, not only from God, but also by Europe, and also our important contribution to development cooperation.At the end, a question in which we, as the world's most important economic and trade power, are increasingly responsible, is the voice of the European Union in the world.This not only means an active attitude in relation to the millennium round.This means the reform of the United Nations and the International Financial Institutions in which Europe bears huge responsibility.And above all, and with that, and with that, Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to be able to express this in an understandable and clear language by changing the jargon we use in a way, because we cannot ask for the Europeans to go through deep changes and share our enthusiasm if we continue to maintain a very difficult to understand and turn back to them.This is the most important means of increasing and strengthening trust, which, in any case, can be measured in the next European elections.Mr Commission President, First of all, on behalf of my faction, I would like to assure you that we share your starting point and support the core of the analysis and the strategy presented in this house today, namely that Europe faces major and clearly political challenges.Politically because we are in a process of further development.Even if it is still working on the economic building blocks, we leave the purely functional structure in Europe and turn to a political perspective characterized by larger challenges.The expansion is a challenge of political nature.The task of creating a space of cooperation in the areas of justice and the interior and managing the problem groups asylum, immigration and crime also has a deeply political character.This also applies to the implementation of a common security and defense policy.The solution is precisely because of the political character of these tasks.The political character means that questions of sovereignty are affected, which in turn causes the citizens and voters to react more sensitive.	de
Waste in Europe are produced at a rate of 1 km per person per day. Two billion tonnes of waste is produced each year in the EU. The European Union is at least clear on the problem of our waste disposal. The future of waste disposal is not in the search for new landfills by local authorities throughout the length and width of the country. Increasingly concern is expressed about the environmental impacts of landfills in general. There is no less than a key transition from our dependence on landfills to other more comprehensive waste management plans. The European Union fully supports the strict, ambitious and feasible goals set by the Irish government. These goals expected to be achieved within the next 15 years include: · Different 50% of total domestic waste from landfills.· A 65% reduction of at least the biodegradable waste delivered to the landfills today.· Developing installations for the use of waste, using useful technologies for the environment, capable of processing 300,000 tonnes of biodegradable waste per year. All of these measures reflect the changes of public opinion on the issue of waste management. The days of landfills are approaching their end and must be replaced by technologies that will be more beneficial to the environment. There is unanimous support for this position and from the fifteen Member States of the European Union..(FR) The impressive volume of waste produced by our industrialized bourgeois societies is undoubtedly one of the greatest challenges that the European Union should take on in the 21st century: Each year the planet is gradually and gradually flooded and the waste produced by the Member States of the Community. Under these circumstances, it is inconceivable to decide to manage these waste in accordance with the law of minimum direct costs: Indeed, the blooming industry (tens of thousands of jobs, billions of euros) which develops on the basis of this increasing need to undoubtedly have to do so in order to do so in order to do so in order to do so in order to do so in order to do so. Upgrading: Incitation, heavy metal and dioxins are released in the atmosphere, cleaning produces unwanted muds and some recycled materials have not found their markets (purchases). The best possible protection of the environment and health therefore goes through significant progress that should be made in the context of the implementation of waste management legislation and whose transfer to national law Priest is far from being satisfactory, according to a recent report by the Commission. We must therefore urge both Member States and their industries to immediately make the efforts necessary to adapt to the principles of protection and environmental protection - and their national law and their techniques for eliminating and not to shift the problem of pollution. At the same time, however, it would be prudent for the European Parliament to draw realistic paths to achievement goals, instead of leaving in these lyrical tendencies and idealistic sayings causing harm to its credibility: in terms of the environment, we will maintain the chances of achieving the desired sustainability.	el
The Council's declaration on the point of view of the European Union regarding the development of the Cyprus question;The report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr. Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy for a Proposal for a Ordinance of Council on the implementation of measures in the context of the approach strategy for Cyprus and Malta (KOM (1999) 0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199 (CNS)).In representation of the council, Mr. Seixas has the floor.President, ladies and gentlemen!On behalf of the Council Presidency of the European Union, I would like to give some information about the resumption of inner -cypriotic negotiations and the latest development on this question.I think it is obvious to everyone that what happened in Helsinki at the end of last year, as well as the new climate, which is particularly noticeable in the relationships between the European Union and Turkey, is an expression of a background at community level, from which the actual framework of the relationship between the two population groups in Cyprus itself cannot remain untouched.I would like to emphasize that at the beginning of December of last year in New York, after several years of interruption, the first new round of negotiations between the Cypriot communities of the north and the south of the island took place.These negotiating rounds were indirect discussions, which were conveyed by the United Nations special representative, Álvaro de Souto.A second round of talks followed in January of this year, it was opened on January 31, and the beginning of a third round is planned for May 23 in New York.There is the possibility, which, however, has not yet been finally confirmed that these conversations can take place directly and continuously and that work will continue by September of this year.In this conversation, four content aspects were essentially discussed: the questions of security, the government structure, the regional adjustments and the refugee and compensation problems as a result of the situation that arose after the division of the island.However, since it was agreed that it would be possible to involve further questions, and so Urauf Denktasch, the representative of the northern part of the island, suggested three new theme complexes: the question of sovereignty, the question of confidence -building measures and the question of the abolition of the embargo against products from the north of the island.In the previous discussions there were essentially two developments: the opportunity to set up a direct information channel between the European Union and the northern part of the island is evident, without this inevitably means recognizing this island as a structure with its own legal personality at an international level.The goal is to facilitate the assumption of a joint acquis with a possible accession of the entire island, should it be possible in the meantime to solve the global problem of the division of the island.The second development that seems important to us consists in the explanation of the United Nations Secretary General at the end of the first day of the conversation, in which he assured that if one achieved an overall regulation of the situation, this would result in recognition of the peculiarities of the island order.This point of view that the United Nations General Secretary has represented is a factor that naturally has to incorporate into our future analysis.	de
Secondly, I would very strongly support your commitment to set clear goals for both economic growth and employment. However, I would like to add that if the Lisbon Summit wants a genuine social summit, we also need to be able to concretize what we want to do to modernize and strengthen social security. Here too, we need expertise standards. Here too, we want the Luxembourg process. Then, finally, I support the European Commission's goal of shaping an ambitious European poverty norm and significantly reduces poverty in ten years. Mr President of the Council, I think it is important that we are designing a goal of this issue so that all Member States are challenged to combat the social exclusion of all citizens of our societies, not just children but also their parents and the elderly of this society. I wish the council's chairman with its goals. Mr President, Mr President of the Council, the Extraordinary Meeting of the European Council on Economic Reform and Social Cohesion, as you said, to the ambitious, very ambitious, even with the threat that it is disappointing to our compatriots who are not sufficient for adoption. However, this summit has a word of very significant in a word: the presentation of political will after Cardiff and Luxembourg for greater social cohesion, and especially for the benefit of 57 million people living in our region in poverty, including single mothers, multi -child families and children and in the futurecause new social imbalance. Therefore, there is a need to develop economic and social policy that is determined to avoid the digital gap between those who receive high and unrelated information, or digital fracture, as one of my colleagues just said. Therefore, I believe that new techniques are a great tool for integration for our growth only if their use is taught since childhood, as half of the jobs are in the field of information that is directly related to information technology by 2010. In this sense, I recommend that three decisions are made at the Lisbon Summit: firstly, a decision on a lifelong education strategy, which includes a plan to eliminate both economic and mental poverty for children;Secondly, the decision to establish a European company in favor of the European research area;And third, a decision to draw up a method of work and coordination that is open and associated with social and economic policy and includes a joint evaluation of our national plans. Mr President, Dear Members of the Parliament, Presidential State Portugal's statement includes the idea that I especially like. This single idea is the view that the strength of our European economy is based on performance, imagination and creativity, that is, the knowledge of people involved in the processes of the economy. However, if we take this seriously, if this is really meant to be a political program, then other justification for politics promoting society in society will no longer be needed, as social involvement in itself would be the strongest production power of our common economy. Mr President of the Council, as far as this is the case, we need very urgent common goals. We need stable goals that we make to measure - both qualitatively and quantitatively - and which go beyond increasing employment figures, just as the Commission has already suggested. We need stable, co -resulting goals that go further - just as the Commission has already suggested - as a reduction in unemployment to 4 % by 2010. The end of the thought of the thought is that Ecofin ministers receive praise in their domestic countries for successful stabilization, but at the same time the responsibility for Europe's huge unemployment problem is overshadowed. I wish you the strength, the support of the Parliament for your case, and the determination of investment in favor of our Parliament in the future, as in the future, as the European citizens expect it.	fi
Austrian refugee policy will not change! The countryside accounts for more than 80 % of the EU area and 25 % of the population lives there. As a farmhouse and a member of the Parliament, I have always tried to look at the whole countryside, not just agriculture. In particular, I appreciate the integrated approach to rural development, as I am convinced that only networking of all the occupational groups and all people in the countryside enables an active and attractive living space for everyone, summarized in rural multifunction. I would especially like to praise the scope of the new Leader+program. In the future, there may be programs in addition to individual support areas in all EU regions. This horizontal approach makes sense, as rural development programs are also designed. Funding will not come from three funds anymore but only from the EMOTR control fund. Therefore, it is necessary to improve the quality of the programs as Emotr is an effective tool. Accuracy in choosing objects leads to an increase in efficiency, as money must not be spent unplanned. In particular, I would like to emphasize the point that forms the starting point for an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy. The countryside in this area will have major opportunities for employment in the future, and we have to take advantage of them if we want to give the people of the countryside a faith in the future. Therefore, rural policy is practiced for farms other than farmers. Leader+is intended to complement existing programs, avoid overlaps and dual funding, and thus influence the widest possible development. In this way, Leader+ can better emphasize with the programs of Regulation No 1257/99 from the second column of the Circle and have the best impact on the entire rural area. Mr President, Mr Presidents, I am not always proud of the hustle and bustle of this Parliament, but the Urban program is one of the best examples of our activities, it was born at the initiative of Parliament. The Commission would have removed Urban, but this time the Parliament pulled a longer stalk. It is good that Urban continues as it has produced good results at the local level. The problems of European urban areas are worsening;Fortunately, we are now in agreement with the Commission. Most of the European population lives in cities, and their problems are the most important and very complex issues in regional policy. The risk of exclusion is high. Many cities in French and English already have slums where there are many evil. None of us wants Favelo, South America in Europe. We have to act now before it's too late. Cities also play a crucial role in the European economy. We always return to the same basic European problem: our economy is not enough to encourage or dynamic enough. The economic life must be strong in order to take care of our neighbors and our surroundings. This is not politics, but the simple logic of life. It is good to spend money now that the money is concentrated because with a scattered shoot, the gunpowder disappears into the wind of the sky like a sparrow flock. Now we need to focus on solving small and medium -sized cities because they do not have enough critical mass. In this way, we can also give additional speed to the surrounding rural areas;It is often overlooked that cities and rural problems actually go hand in hand. It is based on encouraging individual innovation and entrepreneurship, as the mass movement that started with the individual is renewing the area internally. Giving funding without the economy standing on your own feet is the same as carrying water to the well: there is enough drinking for a moment, but tomorrow the well is empty again. Mr President, the implementation of Interreg III, will move into a new phase in the Union's cooperation policy. Our attention is made not only by internal boundaries but also the external boundaries. From the point of view of the world-to-world and cultural transparency, the European Union needs tools that can strengthen ties and communication channels between the Union and the border areas, especially in the eastern and southern parts of Europe. The borders of the Union must no longer mean a barrier to balanced development, but on the contrary, the possibility and bridge to make cooperation even more fruitful.	fi
Our group also hopes that the written list of European fundamental rights will provide a stronger legal and ethical foundation for European integration value and can promote greater openness of the community with the citizen and the citizen's ability to understand the community. It is very important for our group that the European Charter of Fundamental Rights must not in any way compensate or violate the legislation on the human rights of Member States. There was a heated debate on the requirement that the European Union should join the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Freedom of Freedom of Freedom of Human Rights and Freedom of Freedom. The Council of Europe Convention is now 50 years old. Our group is opposed to the Union's accession to the Contracts Party, firstly, because the agreement is at odds with current European agreements, but, above all, because we need a list of our own fundamental rights for the European Union, which reflects the current state of belief. At the same time, however, this means that we only have to deal with classical fundamental rights and avoid expanding the Charter to also include social and economic fundamental rights that cannot be implemented at European level. I would like to thank the reporters for their extensive work and hope that the reflections of the European Parliament will find their way to the negotiations of the European Union Fundamental Rights Book. Mr President, Duff and Voggenhuber, the report of the report, as well as the Committee on Basic Agreement, Rules of Procedure and Instituting have done a good job. The report itself is good because it conveys a central message, but does not go so far that the work of the preparatory committee of the European Union's Charter is done in advance. Therefore, I see the hopes that this report will be accepted in tomorrow's plenary session in the form in which we have prepared it in the Committee on Fundamental Rights. However, I would like to have a check in one point. I have also submitted a review proposal in this section in the name of my group. It applies to the topic discussed on several occasions today, the accession of the European Union into a contractual part of the European Human Rights Agreement. This union's joining of the European Human Rights Convention was previously an important objective. It was an important and right goal in the past as long as it was not intended to create a list of its own independent fundamental rights at the European Union level. Thus, it was a much better than empty solution as the second best solution. However, the Convention is not the way we want and should travel in Europe in the future. With all respect for the Human Rights Agreement - we need more! We need a book of fundamental rights, which contains our answer to the questions of our time. Our answer is a balanced relationship between classic-liberal rights, proper financial rights, and the good solutions between the European Union citizens and social rights. The European Convention on Human Rights does not fulfill this task. It cannot fill it because it was born in completely different political and social conditions in the 1950s. Therefore, it is time for all of us to demand a constructive work on our own fundamental rights book. The preparation of the European Union Charter, these 62 politicians, from which member David Martin spoke, is required to take care of this work. Let us support them in this job! Mr President, the legitimate objective of the Human Rights Book is to protect the reasoned rights, expectations and efforts of citizens from the coercion of government, business and other citizens;And, of course, it is right that people are thus protected from the Union's institutions and their actions. However, it has already been said that the most important thing is not the existence of a fundamental rights book, but the proper protection of citizens, and the means by which a citizen today receives such protection varies from a different Member State. From the point of view of the normal legislative process of the community, I am a little surprised that it was not considered necessary to pursue this through the existing legal and administrative mechanisms of each Member State. In other words, this policy should be implemented on the basis of the directive and not the regulation. For example, I was recently in speeches with some of the very experienced main strides in Germany, and it was clear to them based on the history and traditions of their country that these things should be included in the legal book.	fi
Every chairperson or chair has as many votes as the parliamentary group has members.There was a vote on this point.According to my memory, this coordination went out like this: 422 against 180 votes in a few abstentions.This means that all factions, with the exception of the lessons - but they are not a parliamentary group - agreed, only their faction was of the opinion that it was the case to proceed as they suggested here.Everyone else disagreed.That was the decision.Now I want to say something about the matter myself.We have confidence in the Commission, Romano Prodi, and the very large majority of our parliamentary group have given Romano Prodi and the Commission after a difficult process, as everyone knows, the trust.But we are also of the opinion that we have to conduct a debate about this commission's strategy in an orderly procedure, not only on the basis of an oral explanation here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document that has been decided in the Commission and describes this program for five years.There is no such document!The Commission will present the program for the year 2000 in February.We said that if the Commission does not want to do the 2000 program in January, we will do it in February.We agreed.We do not want a dispute with the Commission in itself, but we believe that if possible, the Commission and Parliament have to go a common way.But we as a parliament are also the commission's controller.And not everything that comes from the Commission must be our opinion.I want us to be able to prepare for a debate about the five -year program in the political groups.You cannot prepare if you hear an explanation here and do not even know what the content of such an explanation is.That is why it is our recommendation - and my impression is that the Commission is also open -minded for this idea - that in February we will lead the debate about the long -term commission until 2005 - I hope that the Commission will also agree on a program that it will suggest to us - and that we will also lead the debate about the Commission's legislative program for the year 2000.So it is also a sensible factual connection that advises us to jointly discuss the debate about both programs.That is why my faction decidedly rejects the proposal of the socialist group!(Applause from the PPE-DE parliamentary group) I suggest that we vote on the application of the Social Democratic Group to put the Commission on the agenda of the Commission on the agenda.(The parliament rejects the application.) The President.On Wednesday I have another application regarding the oral request for capital tax.The PPE/DE faction requested that this point can be deducted from the agenda.Does anyone want to justify the application on behalf of the faction?Ms. President, since I hear a little laughter from the socialists - I was told that long circles of the socialist parliamentary group would also like to have this agenda item, because the vote of the working group of the responsible colleagues in the socialist group did not exist when coordinating the president's conference.	de
"I believe that the idea of ​​creating an observatory for the evolution of this coherence between community policies and the cooperation and development policy is sufficiently wise and relevant;Its scope should not be limited to community policies, but must also cover the actions or policies of the Member States, including the actions of economic groups, which seems important to me.Each year, this observatory will have to develop a report on the evolution and impacts of these policies and their conjugation.I left for the end a question which seems fundamental to me and which must be recorded and approved by this parliament.This new objective of minimizing contradictions between the policy of cooperation and development and other policies must be a valid objective not only within the European Union, but also at the world level, given the growing globalization of the economy.If we want a just global trade, we must impose this same principle on the next cycle of multilateral negotiations of the World Trade Organization of Trade, because it would be contradictory for the European Union to establish itself an iron discipline, but just, while the United States and other great powers would then do the opposite and approve of what we do not do.This is why it is fair and fundamental that these principles be established during the next cycle of the World Trade Organization.The President, the Director General of the DG of development said that producing a report on the coherence of EU policies with development policies, before the presentation, next spring, of the document on the development policy itself, was equivalent to placing the cart before the bugs.It does not matter if the Commission, subject to the requirement to produce an annual report, clearly established in the resolution of the council, produced only one ""non-documentary"".The real problem is that at the time of tackling world poverty, these bugs climb a coast and the trolley of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is in fact gently pulled back.Many and many times, the development policy is forgotten or we only think of it after the fact, when the major policies of the European Union have already been examined.Take the new chocolate directive, which indicates that the EU countries spend more for chocolate each year than for development aid.This directive has not been the subject of any correct development evaluation and the producing countries, 90 % of which are our ACP partners, estimate that it could decrease the income of cocoa cultivators by at least 15 %.Take the fishing agreements, in which we recognize the non-durability of current fishing practices in UE waters.We are in the process of negotiating, at the same time, joint operations allowing reinforced access to European fishery ships in the waters of developing countries at the expense of 190 million small fishermen from these countries all over the world.Take business agreements.As Mr. Nielson said this morning about Lomé, preferential access only concerns all products from developing countries.In other words, when EU’s commercial interests are at stake, poverty considerations are volatilizing."	fr
Mr President, Good Members, Member of the Commission, winds are favorable to the European Union, which is noted in the European Parliament. Today's agenda has ended up in a rarely lucky way at the same time, Directives from waste incineration and national emission limits to certain air pollutants, as well as the directive without the control of the ozone amount. The air pollution meant the street in the old days, mixed with the dirt of the streets, nowadays it is a large scale of the entire planet and on a small scale, even our own home, that is to say, our entire ecosystem. Now we have to act. Setting emission limits for these four impurities is a surefire to reduce pollution and prevent acidification and the effects of those impurities that are harmful to the health and vegetation of those impurities. In its proposal, the European Commission proposes the nationally defined ceilings, which should be followed by 2010 for those four polluting substances. And in addition, the costs of complying with those values ​​to each Member State are assessed. I think it seems like a good strategy. The excellent report of Member of Parliament Myller clearly assesses the balanced proposal of the European Commission and aims to improve it to some extent. In particular, the Parliamentary Committee has approved a mandatory re -examination of the Directive by 2004, which allows the opportunity to review the emission limits mentioned in the text and to follow those emission limits. All that seems sensible. However, I have to do one question about this: why not allow a Member State to show that the application of a directive in its region is particularly unfavorable, for example due to its geographical and climatic conditions, and that it causes serious harm to it? Wouldn't it make sense? Thus, the European Union's preventing system of air pollution is expanded, strengthened and refined. The environmental policy of the European Union is increasingly the environmental policy of each Member State, which is prominently beneficial to all European citizens. The Mr President, a good member of the Commission, the Commission's proposal emission values ​​are very ambitious, more ambitious than the so -called Gothenburg Protocols agreed in the UN European Economic Commission, and so must be. For my part, I am ready to accept a compromise on the environmental, public health and consumer policy committee by members of the PPE-de group, according to which we follow the Commission's proposal for non-ammonia emissions, as it does not cause major problems with our home country in Finland and our neighbor Sweden. However, I also understand the views that the level of the Gothenburg minutes should be chosen. Whatever the vote tomorrow, I think the Commission must constantly observe that development is taking place in all Member States and promotes measures to help the industry to make the necessary changes. It is important that environmental targets are achieved as cost -effectively as possible throughout the community. European air quality has improved significantly in recent years. Emissions have decreased significantly, at least in the energy sector, traffic and industry. In recent years, there have been constant new EU regulations in the environmental sector and new goals have been set for industry. I find it a bit problematic that the goals are repeatedly changed before properly assessed the practical effects of already approved legislative measures on the environment and the cost of industry. Before imposing additional obligations, it is important to ensure that the actions already agreed in the Member States are fully implemented. In my opinion, these two goals are not in conflict. Finally, when it comes to emissions from shipping and air traffic, I believe that restrictions on emissions must be agreed internationally and at this stage they must be excluded from the scope of the Directive. For long -term goals, I believe that a strict deadline should not be set, but that Member States must, in accordance with their own goals, seek to meet the norms by or before the deadline..(EN) Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, we have progressed well in the fight against acidification as well as contamination in recent years.	fi
Photographs show us that asteroid has no life, but much further away on our castle, there are about 300 billion stars with many planets. Behind the Milky Way there are 300 billion other Milky Ways with countless stars and planets. Therefore, it is likely that there is a lot of life that is in many cases at a much more advanced level of us. Given that the first television programs shipped from the country are now 50 light-years away in space and far from the nearest stars, Imagine with me what those living in the stars think about us as they look at us. What do they see? They see a beautiful planet full of life, but they also see that its climate is contaminated and constantly warming up. They see the logging of the forests and spread desert. Among the lively creatures, they can see many animals being treated cruelly and rare animals are disappearing permanently. How do they currently see the dominant species - that is, us? Well, they see that the natural resources of the earth are unevenly distributed. They see that the country is fighting that there are medications for illness, but not in the world where they are most needed to have school books but are not at all in the world's least developed areas, and that 50 % of the world's population does not make a single call throughout their lives. What do they see about people's relationships? They see us kill each other. They see us restrict each other's freedoms. They see the endless series of local wars. They see that some of our children are deprived of military soldiers or that they are considered prostitutes or slaves. They see unequal treatment between men and women, people of different ages, minorities, different colors, different breeds, belonging to different communities, migrants and even neighbors. This picture is familiar to us all.50 years ago, the UN Human Rights Agreement was a company to remedy this situation. We should be positive about it and I think this is what happens. Only in Europe is human rights secured by law. There are members in the European Parliament who do not want the fundamental rights book to become final. I say to them: Shame! Human rights should be safeguarded by law in all countries in the world. This is the goal we need to strive for. There is still a lot to do, as the Commission member Patten said. Finally, if you asked me, what if the stars don't have life, what if we are alone? What is just as scary, I would reply: Don't you think that we are also responsible for having our children behave properly before letting them pop in to populate other planets? Mr President, Human Rights are global, undivided, interdependent and braided. Many people know the outside of this known slogan borrowed from the UN Human Rights' 1993 World Conference conclusions. It's great, but what is the human rights policy situation in the EU itself? Is this reflecting this view of consistency? Does the European Union really have a human rights policy? By this question, I do not mean the difficulties that Member States have their views on foreign policy and to speak in one mouth about human rights violations in one mouth. Mr President, so I do not mean this, but the lack of human rights policy within the European Union itself. A new government has been formed in Austria, which has been involved in a party that has always spread a message about racism and intolerance to minorities. This is a threat to the human rights for which the EU is flagging, but reactions to these events have made it clear that there is no consistent framework to formulate a suitable reaction. Article 7 borrowed everywhere, which can be removed from a Member State from a Member State that detects serious and continuous human rights violations, is, of course, only a horse, an extreme means mentioned in the case of Austria only in the event of a better lack and warning.	fi
We believe in Europe, but it seems that others have begun to develop the Union's decentralization. These are the consequences of too busy expansion and lack of clarity related to roles and tasks. The European market has been implemented in Europe, not Europe, rights, rights and politics. Here are the consequences! Thus, we can only ask the Commission to continue its moderate work and express our values ​​for those who work for the autonomy and self -determination of the Austrian people, and seek to keep this nation free and solidarity with other peoples. Mr President, good colleagues, we have gathered today at a session, characterized by hypocrisy. We are in a situation where the Council has succeeded in showing that it is minor to the European Union's agreement and that it works in a way that cannot be justified by any Articles 6 and 7 of that agreement, which is authorized to condemn state if it is committed by serious and continuous violations. However, this has not happened in Austria. We are all aware that Austria has taken certain risks, but it is not guilty of serious and continuous violations. If we have to apply the criteria 6 and 7 of the European Union once and to the criteria of Copenhagen to our institution and the European Union, it is certain that the European Union would not be able to meet the criteria required by the Union States required by Eastern European States. When it comes to serious and continuous violations, we could mention two other Member States, namely Italy and France. Italy has been the first and France's third country where serious and continuous violations of the Council of Europe and the Court of Justice of the European Communities in Strasbourg have been condemned. Good Belgian colleagues, we can mention the case of Dutroux, who shaken Belgium, and dozens of children who are abducted by certain Belgian, abused, raped and murdered by studies that are still ongoing. Good colleagues, we have a third of members, if desired, to claim the Council and the Commission to investigate the cases I mentioned above. We should consider why the Austrians have abandoned a 10, up to 13 years of party power that has ruined and ruined Austria in the same way as it is now doing destruction in Italy, Belgium and other Member States of the Union. Good colleagues, we would really have to consider why 76 % of the Belgians have no confidence in their country's judiciary, why 56 % of French have no confidence in their country's judiciary and why 53 % of Italians have no little confidence in the country's judiciary ...are very concerned about this debate. We cannot support, nor support, in any way Jörg Haider's views or politics, and apologize for his references to the third kingdom. However, we also apologize for the fact that your parliament is considering intervening in the policy of a government chosen by a country, especially the country of the European Union. My party in the UK is certainly not racist, but we also do not very much accept the power of the European Union or its intervention. Will you intervene in the British Parliament if we are elected there? Mr President, the Austrian people have spoken by choosing Jörg Haider for their parliament. It must have given him 28 percent of the votes, so a coalition government is formed. Mr President, your parliament, should, in my opinion, wait for the Haider party to have an impact on the politics of that country. Then, and then, you can consider whether human rights have been offended. Your Parliament may consider appropriate action to remedy the situation, and then, the Mr President, and only then your parliament may consider intervening in the constitutional matters of the Member State of the European Union. Mr President, Mr Presidents, I would like to make one thing clear at first: there is no danger in Austria's re -arrival of a one -party system or a right -wing totalitarian system.	fi
I would like to remind you that the first -mentioned urban initiative pursues the goal of improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in different cities in Europe, while the second, Interreg, promoting cohesion and the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union should recognize and at a time when the regions are in extreme outskirts are about to be included in chapter B and C.Like the rapporteur, we also regret that chapter IIIa was excluded.In terms of Interreg, we are very appropriate to refer to the establishment of a European observation center for the effects of the cooperation.We thank the ladies and gentlemen, especially Mr. Decourrière, for the empathy in terms of regional policy and for taking into account our amendments.I hope that the Lord commissioner accepts our proposal.President!In connection with the various initiatives that we discuss this afternoon, I would like to strictly limit myself to a consideration of a program, to urban.One thing is certain: just because the European Parliament stubbornly insisted on continuing this initiative, we debate about this program today.The Commission's intention was to let this and other initiatives expire.However, the proposal of the parliament and the timely insight of the Commission should be thanked for urban.I think we can congratulate each other.But what arguments did the Commission, in the specific case, have given Ms. Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and the General Director, Mr. Eneko Landaburu, for the expiry of urban?They had a convincing argument.Urban questions are too important to limit them to a program with very low center equipment.Today we have the program, I think we have achieved something important: Urban has become an identity -creating sign in the European Union.But I would like to say to Commissioner Barnier that I share the argument of the Commissioner and the Director General, because they were right.The urban dimension has to find its way into all structural funds much more.In view of the household funds that our cities need -80 % of the European population live there, and there are the good and bad examples of what there are in Europe -I believe that this European dimension must be taken into account and that this urban program must not be the justification for not to analyze the problems comprehensively, not to set priorities and therefore do not provide a much higher budget for programs in connection with citiesAs part of all European funds.Therefore, I think that it is not necessary to check the number of factors that justify this investment in urban areas.The factors are known and I would like to tell the Lord Commissioner that we count on his understanding in this regard.The cross-sectoral approach anchored in the new equal initiative is to be welcomed.At the same time, however, it is of crucial importance that the program makes something against the significant discrimination, which affects disabled people in particular: physical obstacles in the workplace, to which people with limited mobility, visual information systems that cannot be used by blind workers, in which people with learning weaknesses or mental illness have no chance.	de
The implementation of this component is the responsibility of the Member States and the national authorities;And the C section which organizes interregional cooperation between different regions of Member States or third countries by networking experiences concerning aspects of A and B as well as cooperation in the field of research, technological development, subject to defining with the European Commission, which is responsible for its implementation.The new Interreg program, as it has been transmitted to us, takes into account the needs generated by enlargement to the PECO and the island and ultraperipheral regions.The Commission offers us to distribute the endowment of Interreg as follows: from 50 to 80 % for component A, 6 % for the C section, the difference for the B section, that is to say from 14 to 44 % to the maximum.The European Commission establishes the list of regions eligible for component A and Bite B. It was essentially based on the map of eligible regions during the previous programming period.Ultraperipheral regions can benefit from support for component B. The Commission establishes a list of priority areas and eligible non -exhaustive measures for component A, but exhaustive for component B. It reserves the right to subsequently propose themes that it considers important for experience exchange and reinforced cooperation between regions, for the C.Programs are set by the general regulations on structural funds.The proposals are established by the Member States and submitted for approval to the European Commission which verifies their compliance with the general orientations selected.These proposals must include a certain number of elements, an overview of cross -border or transnational strategies and priorities, a description of the measures necessary for their implementation and an indicative financing plan.I am part of the vast majority of parliamentarians who voted for the maintenance of the Interreg community initiative program.I regret that the Parliament was not informed of the evaluation of the previous program - which would have enabled an optimal efficiency of the new measures implemented, but I know the difficulty of this operation -, I also regret an extremely short work calendar, since the text was examined in parliamentary committee on November 24 and January 26, and I also regret that neither the regions nor the representative regional organizationsprogram.By promoting cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this transversal instrument is the very embodiment of a regional policy of European dimension favorable to a harmonious and balanced development of the community.Madam President, Dear colleagues, Gentlemen and Ladies The Commissioners, the Conference on Rural Development, which was held in Cork from November 7 to 9, 1996, defined rural development as one of the priorities of the European Union, since an event in agriculture, to support the existence and continuous development, to provide farmers with an environment endowed with the necessary infrastructures and services, also essential for better respect for the environment and better quality of lifeFinally for the diversification and creation of workstations.	fr
"That said, we can positively assess the different organization of guidelines which, leaving aside geographic objectives, are intended for sectoral policies.If, in theory, this can meet the requirements of concentration and therefore the effectiveness of interventions, a question arises of itself, the question of whether the current situation of the regions of objective 1 allows in fact a policy of integrated interventions, which requires an operational instrument of coordination of the sums allocated.We could then in principle respond even positively to the request of the Commission which wants to create a management center for structural promotion in the Member States responsible for coordinating the application and management of structural interventions on site, provided that this center does not become a centralizing instrument of supranational level and guarantees that effective attention is paid to these regions which - I reiterate it once againStill reached correct levels in the use of structural funds, so that the replacement of the geographical objective with sectoral policies could lead to a negative intervention in fact.The guidelines, as approved by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of responding to the objective aimed at indicating orientations, they provide a catalog of possible provisions, a catalog which, in the absence of a progressive definition of priorities, could squarely put the Member States on a false way by directing them towards a range of proposals contrary to the concentration sought.You could say that in the current state of things, we have still lost the opportunity to effectively strengthen sustainable urban development containing the growing phenomenon of urbanization and degradation of the related landscape.We have not correctly estimated the importance of the instrument of the global subsidy which could prove to be very useful to rebalancing between urban and rural areas by conferring, in addition, dignity which is essential to local organizations which, by their autonomy, could define conditions of territorial development including shorter deadlines, thus contributing to the efforts of reform of structural funds and the objectives of efficiency, concentration and objectivesadministrative relaxation.Rural space must really be considered a resource in which it is necessary to invest more and more, by encouraging young people to stay in rural regions to avoid their economic and social destruction.We now know that, to achieve this goal, it will be necessary to create, in rural areas, jobs no longer linked to agriculture as it is traditionally envisaged - which however constitutes an essential instrument for safeguarding the environment and biodiversity - but in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, environment, small and medium -sized enterprises or services.We note in the guidelines a real vacuum due to the lack of concrete orientations in order to ensure coordination between the ESF and the strategies for employment, coordination which, since it is applied precisely for the first time for the 2000-2006 programming period, presupposes that the Member States need ""guidelines""."	fr
I therefore plead in favor of maintaining what was planned: debate Friday, vote later.Madam President, I owe an explanation to Mr. Wurtz and I will provide it to the whole parliament.We had reached this agreement in principle at the Conference of Presidents.At that time, I did not know that the commissioner, Mr. Bolkestein, was going to tackle the subject next week during his hearing by the Commission of Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.In addition, we have debated the question within my group and we think, given the current situation in the entire process of market integration and deregulation on such a sensitive subject, that the Parliament should be done in the future, pronounces first so that the commissioner, Mr. Bolkestein, takes good note and to guide the debate next week.Madam President, I would simply like to invite my colleague Wurtz to reread and check what it is.It is not a substantive discussion here, but simply the following question: when the commission will finally be able to present the directive, when it has already had a year and a half to do this?Thanks to this resolution, we only want the deadlines to which the Commission had granted to be respected.Therefore, it is important that we act as quickly as possible.This is why I would like to support the proposal made by the Social Democrats to vote this Friday.(The Parliament marks her agreement) Madam President, the Cederschiöld report no longer on the agenda of the Thursday session, we should that day have a little more time.Given the number of subjects that will have to be debated in an hour and a half, the emergency session may be very tight.Could not the service of the acts of the plenary session check if it is possible to grant us an additional half hour for the emergency session, so that we have sufficient speaking time?Last week, the organization of the session seems to me to have been very chaotic.We had a very tight timing in terms of speaking time, then suddenly, last Thursday, we ended up with a void on the agenda for an hour, even an hour and a half.We had to wait until the vote.This Friday, only one subject is on the agenda.It is completely absurd.I would urgently want to examine the organization of the session.This is one thing that is quite possible: so if we can extend the emergency session for half an hour, given the withdrawal of Ms. Cederschiöld's report.This is good that it is and only that.Madam President, I wanted to intervene in relation to the agenda on Wednesday, which you did not announce.	fr
This is the correct procedure.President!According to Article 69 (2), I apply for the transfer to the committee.The reason is that this is the alignment of a legal provision that the Commission proposed.We accepted this, but proposed further alignment of the legal provisions that affect this directive, above all to use and identify genetically modified organisms.We believe that this belongs to this adjustment at this point, but the commission does not take over.I think we have to try to talk to the Commission in accordance with Article 69 (2), and that's why I ask my colleagues to agree to the return transfer.(The parliament accepts the application for a transfer to the committee.) Report (A5-0034/2000) by Ms. Stenzel on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission on the Member States to determine the guidelines for programs in the context of community initiatives (PGI), for which the member states can submit suggestions for support in the Equal initiative (COM (COM (COM))476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186/COS)) Before the vote: Mr. President, let me publicly say Ms. Stenzel as a member of the board of the ÖVP that many MPs are horrified that you have received a coalition with Haider and that we want to condemn this here!(Applause from left, interjection from right) Dear Mr. Cohn-Bendit, Hohes Haus!I think the European Parliament is not the place to intervene in the domestic policy of a country as massively as they do!I can speak for my party, which was a pioneer for the fact that Austria joined the European Union and joined.As a political force, we are the guarantee that Austria remains connected to European values.I refuse to have myself put in a right corner for internal and party political reasons!This does not correspond to the facts, but is pure polemics!I reject this with determination!(Lively, long -lasting applause from the middle and right, protest from left) I would like to take the opportunity to welcome a delegation of four members of the Moroccan Parliament under the direction of Mr. Brahim Rachidi, Vice President of the House of Representatives.We look forward to visiting this delegation so shortly before the entry into force of the association agreement between Morocco and the European Union on March 1, 2000. On the occasion of this historical step, we welcome the developments in our relationships and the prospect of intensifying the contacts between our two parliaments.For this purpose, a delegation for relationships with the Maghreb countries and the Union of the Arab Maghreb will travel to Morocco from March 20 to March 22.I wish the delegation a successful stay in Strasbourg.(Lively applause) Mr President, since you are greeting a delegation, I would like to take the opportunity to tell you that today we also have the pleasure of welcoming the main responsible for the Austrian associations against racism in our house that have given parliament the honor of their visit.	de
And while it is difficult for Europe to talk about the peace process, it can speak and must talk about it in the same spirit of trust and solidarity. The following is the oral issues asked by the Council (B5-0040/99) and the Commission (B5-0041/99) on the annual debate on liberty based on justice and safety (Article 39) on the agenda of the Council (B5-0040/99). Mr President, important events in 1999 have been the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, the transfer of the Schengen Treaty to the Community and the Extraordinary European Council of Europe. These have been the most significant moments in which the Council has expressed its political will to create an area based on freedom, security and justice in the European Union. The Council has decided to draw up a charter for citizens' rights of which we are happy;It has decided to enforce Article 13 of the Treaty, which concerns the fight against all forms of discrimination and the strangers, and has also decided to approximate the legislation on access and residence conditions, and guarantee the fair and equal treatment of the union. The Council has also reached a political agreement and is pleased with the first proposals on civilian cooperation. This year, a community frame has been created for policies on legal and internal affairs. These have been given to a single Commission member, Antonio Vitorino, and we are pleased with it. In addition, his mission has been designed to design a tool that can be used to check how this is actually made at the Community level, but also, and this is also important at the level of Member States. We are delighted and congratulated the Council for these decisions, although Parliament believes that the Amsterdam agreement was disappointed: for five years, our mission, our ability to actively participate, and to democratically oversee this area of ​​freedom, security and legal. Mr President, if we look at the development of the 1999 development, such as the Parliament, in accordance with the mandate in the establishment agreement, will leave the flamboyant statements and move on to the decisions that are truly made and implemented, the landscape will still be blurred. Just as if the Council had more than one face and more than two hands, just as if the other one would water what the other sign and promises. Despite the highest levels made at the highest level, the Council has not succeeded in making the decisions it has taken on the agenda itself. The number of programs is increasing and overlaps, and there are no means to check their implementation and efficiency levels, or at least not the parliament has them. We have asked the Council several questions, and I know that the Presidential State Portugal wants to answer each of them. Hopefully, this presidency will mean a start to the change in the attitudes of the Council in terms of Parliament. I said that the decisions made by the Council and the actual policies implemented do not match each other. My group and also this parliament also have doubts about one thing that should be good news: the inclusion of the Schengen Treaty into the community frame. The Schengen Treaty has been included in this previously said in the Community Code, but has not been made very openly. During this process, the Parliament has not received any communication, no questions have been asked;Not about joining the United Kingdom, not about the joining of Greece or negotiations with Norway and Iceland. The same applies to immigration policy. We have spent our time by preparing heaps of reports, but we do not know what has happened to these initiatives;They have disappeared. We hope that the year 2000 is the year of events, as 1999 was a year of expectations.	fi
In the case of Sweden, the excisees are actually used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.Although this leads to an increase in the increases between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that as such, it increases the transfective smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to reduce the consumption of alcohol.Of course, there is the elasticity of demand;In this case, the elasticity of the price of demand.I am not quite sure of its value but it is not zero and it must therefore have an effect.My question would have been almost identical to that raised by Mr. Purvis but I would like to push further argument.By admitting, as you have said, that the accused rights are a prerogative of the Member States, the fact remains that the use of this prerogative in a discriminatory and inequitable manner with regard to producers of a part of the community vis-à-vis other producers can come into conflict with the principle of the single market.For example, if we consider what M. Purvis and I think -to the regions of whiskey highlands, which are particularly peripheral regions of Europe, subject to strong pressure, where communities practicing agriculture and distillation depend entirely on this production -, the general practice which aims to tax the alcohol contained in the Scottish Whisky,Danish aquavit more strongly than the alcohol contained in beer or wine seems to me to be discriminatory and fall under discriminatory use of a practice commonly recognized as the prerogative of the Member States..Let me confirm to Mr. Maccormick and other members of this Parliament that the current situation, in which the increases differ between the Member States, is indeed not likely to promote the proper functioning of the internal market.We must not limit ourselves to alcoholic products.If we consider essence, for example, we see that the excisees perceived in Germany are different from those perceived in the Netherlands: it follows that the Dutch drivers cross the border and refuel in Germany.It is indeed a distortion of the internal market.If he only died, I will use a magic wand to harmonize the excisees in Europe.This would result in the end of any smuggling, unless products are intrinsically more expensive in certain Member States.But I don't have a magic wand and it doesn't just want me.It is an area subject to unanimity, as Mr. Maccormick knows, and unless all of the Member States agree on the harmonization of the increases, it will not take place.Once again, the Commission will submit, towards the end of the year, a report on the inventory in terms of excise and it goes without saying that I am arranged to any discussion with the Parliament about this report.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.Today, we are going to take care of you and offer you a drink - or two, perhaps - of Alsace wine, whose taxation we do not know, although I suppose it will also be struck with high taxes.The time scheduled for the time of questions to the Commission being exhausted, questions 55 to 114 will receive written answers.	fr
The national of a third state benefiting from a legal status in a Member State must also be admitted to other Member States.This does not prevent these states from taking public order measures within the framework of the proposed prior notification obligation.The commission also unacceptable the proposal to maintain the legal status three months after the expiration of the card.It is unacceptable that the national concerned can remain in the host country after the end of his service.This is why the Commission supports, in these two respects, the amendment 22 of Mrs. Palacio.With regard to the second proposal, the Commission includes the wish of a clear definition of the independent concept and it therefore intends to bring a solution to it in its modified proposal.These are some preliminary remarks on the most important amendments.I hope you will give me a new opportunity, at the end of the debate and after all the speakers are expressed, to extend to the various amendments.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, during the vote of tomorrow, the PPE group will support a large majority of the amendment proposals for the Legal Commission as well as the editorial modifications.I will limit my intervention to two areas.The first field is the question of what this directive should have the literal sense of the word.On the one hand, there are the interests of the economy and the individual.Let's say immediately that my explanations start from the principle that it is an honest individual and a conscientious worker.On the other hand, there is the interests of the Member States which may be considering the worst on the people concerned.If we are considering one of the extremes, the interests of the Member States, there are certainly good reasons for providing obstacles quite high in the issuance of this card.Then there are good reasons to justify the quick introduction, despite this card, notification obligations.If I plan the other extreme, namely as many obstacles as possible, I run the risk that this procedure deprives me of any legislation because the Member States will not give the directive.At the end of the day, either I will have a directive on the service provision of services that no one will have in fact because the obstacles placed in the economic sector will be too large, or I will not even have a directive.None of the two results can satisfy us.This may also be the reason why we are told that negotiations also wedge on this subject to the council.We have tried to find a balance, a solution as light as possible, between the interest that constitutes public order and the other interest.We want to have a solution that dismantles certain obstacles placed in the economic sector but which allows you to reach, once these obstacles have been overcome, an application as light as possible.This is why we want a service service to be requested for one or for several Member States.If a French firm declares that one of its employees must work permanently in Denmark and only in Denmark, the service card should be able to be requested for this country alone.	fr
"I try to get to know it as a new member of the Parliament and I have to honestly say it is difficult for me. I have found a number of studies ordered by the Commission, as well as documents of the Post Europe, which say that the studies are not correct and that the foundation on which they have been carried out is wrong. I believe that the Commission could have been a bit more active in this matter, and it could have provided us more information and provided us with the studies it had promised and had requested. As far as I know, this has still not happened. So I ask for a way, the Member of the Commission, to help me in this task because I am a new member of the Parliament. Like Mr Miller, I would like you to find out for us in the months or weeks, or if possible, even in the coming days, how to implement the 1997 Directive. Another thing: how is the general services, what they pay for, what do they consist of, how are you going to organize them, what suggestions do you have? I'd love to have more concrete information about them. The post office is apparently a very strong interest group and is justified. Hundreds of thousands of people earn a living in the post office. In addition, as Member Millerkin said in a densely populated home country, even the end of the world would not be the end of the world, even if the postman no longer came to the door. However, there are a lot of people in my country, such as older people who meet only one person who is a postman during the day. So let us keep in mind: Post is more than transporting letters and packages. The mail is also very important to companies. One study shows that 90 % of mail traffic is between companies and only 10 % are between individuals. What do you really want to free up? I would like more information, because the most important question is how to better serve customers using existing services. There are postal services with a monopoly position but still worked quite well. Such things need to be protected and other things must be questioned. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, I heard this morning on the French national radio channel that the release of mail would be practically only hours or days, and that it would be irreversible, as well as visited our Swedish, Dutch and German friends. We are deeply worried about this and that is why we have asked for this debate today. The Commission has actually committed to the Post's Universal Service, and the European Parliament has shown many times that postal services are indeed, as some colleagues have already said, an essential factor for regional and social cohesion. In this respect, I would like to turn to our Swedish colleague to ask him what he thinks of a report that is indeed demonstrated that in Sweden's most remote areas, postal services would rather be miserable for distribution. So we do not want such postal services. The Amsterdam Agreement recognizes the economic benefits of postal services and we consider that this applies to a much broader area than just distribution. These are the services that are closest to the citizens and we call them ""public services"". They allow anyone living on the soil of Europe to enjoy these services and must be maintained as a communal benefit. The European Union has acknowledged the existence of high quality and all -intended postal services, which is currently threatened and we are more concerned about it. That is why we ask today that we will not have to experience unpleasant surprises on Monday in the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee. We remind you that the positions of the Parliament have been clearly determined and that the Greens have supported them. The resolution issued on 14 January 1999 asked that before continuing any release of this key area, however, for 1.7 million employees, the Commission must conduct a research on the effects of this release."	fi
"We ask the Commission to check these proposals again.Finally, we would like to emphasize the MPs of voting capital requirements, especially against amendment, as we believe that this would be very bad for the industry.I would like to notice that I am the first member to stay within his time limit.President, Pecunia Non Olet, said the Latin.What matters is that the money increases.This is the only point where we bring the interest of the economists into agreement with the interest of all those who want to earn and only have the dollars in the head, like Dagobert Dug, which is shown with the dollar sign instead of the eyes, only that in the present case it is the euro sign.Here we bring together the interest of these citizens and the interest of the pensioners who want to lead a carefree life.For example, my brother -in -law, who lives in Rome, has become a pensioner a year ago, and since then he has been pursuing the development of pension funds and securities in the television screen until midnight on the television.The pensioners will have huge amounts of money in the future.While the young arms are swallower, the old money has accumulated and because they want to multiply it, they are very interested in this guideline.If the national governments - like the European Union with this guideline - the increase in money earned in the course of working life would be concerned, the burning problem of the pension explosion would have already been solved.You, Commissioner Bolkestein, also have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly people and pensioners, a future that I hope that you will be better after we will have passed this guideline in accordance with the proposal of colleagues Villiers and Kauppi as quickly as possible.Mr President, First of all, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Olle Schmidt, and the members of the leading committee for economy and currency.My thanks also go to Mr. Brian Crowley as the author of the statement and the members of the Committee on Law and internal market for their recognition and intensive efforts to design and expand the proposals.Since the adoption of Directive 85/611, the capital and securities market has steadily developed, so that the applicable provisions must now be adapted accordingly.The new proposals are aimed at maintaining a uniform minimum level in investor protection, which is an essential prerequisite for the integration of the markets as a result of the introduction of the euro.Since the European average family creates their savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions for prudent administration - I would particularly like to underline this - for a prudent administration in terms of investment policy and risk scattering.The two suggestions form a coherent whole.The first proposal extends the instruments in which an ""organism for common systems in securities"" - OGAW - can invest.As already explained, Ogaw are among the most important actors on the modern financial markets."	de
This is why it is necessary to focus your attention on politicians - Mr. Karas also spoken about it - which lead to the overvaluation of such or such a currency in relation to its effective potential.However, this would require control measures for the import and export of capital, otherwise we cannot focus on these policies.The Tobin tax therefore seems a judicious idea, but it is not devoid of problems, even if we managed to put it in place, which, I repeat, I doubt.It should be remembered that in the current state of things, money is above all information, and that in the future the world economy will turn more and more to the strength of knowledge and intellectual capital.It is for this reason that the uninterrupted flow of colossal fortune masses between the financial centers of the world is not purely a speculative activity entirely disconnected from the real economy.If we obstruct by measures of the genus of the Tobin tax this feedback mechanism, which therefore gives users possibilities to make choices, this can have as a result of erroneous choices whose economic cost will be much higher than what the tax would ever harvest.This is why, as Mr. Kalas already explained, our group is absolutely opposed to the adoption of the Tobin tax.Madam President, I intervene in favor of taxation of capital movements for speculative purposes across monetary borders.It seems to me that we can no longer obvious that an action is necessary.In the past 30 years, the volume of monetary transactions has increased by 83 with the following results: first, the total, on a global scale, of central banks barely equals the daily volume of transactions on the exchange markets;Second, the annual world volume of real trade in goods and services is equivalent to exactly three and a half days, out of 350, speculation on the exchange markets, which means that the exchanges of goods and services represent 1 % of capital movements, against 99 % for speculation.Given the unpredictable and irrational scale of world exchange markets, it is increasingly difficult to manage national and regional economies.Computer transactions programs have transformed a marginal phenomenon into a surge, taking on jobs, lives and industries over its passage throughout the planet.The only argument against the taxation of speculative capital movements is that it would undermine the effectiveness of the exchange markets: a somewhat bizarre argument if one thinks of the frenzy that has taken up markets, destroying jobs all over the world, as well in the East Asian as in Europe and in Latin America.Mr. Chirac qualified those who participate in this frenzy of AIDS virus in the world economy.What is needed is to put sticks in the wheels of monetary speculators, exchange agents and sellers of options.It is of course not feasible on the scale of a country, or even on the scale of the euro zone, but it could be done worldwide, with good international cooperation.Europe, Japan and the United States, the Euro, the Yen and the Dollar, would in my opinion constitute a sufficient block.The PPE group disappoints me.	fr
"In the negotiations, the Commission must strive to include each applicant as quickly as possible in the Union.On the other hand, it must be ensured that the previous successes of the integration and the goals continued are not watered down.To prevent this, the Liberals' faction has expressed hope that the government conference will discuss models for a differentiated integration and that a concentric union is created in which there is a state as a core, around which a less integrated outer circle is grouped.It is foreseeable that the inner differentiation of the Union is discussed at the government conference.When treating this question, impartiality is required.A technical improvement in the flexibility system is not sufficient, rather the development of own institutions for the avant-garde countries must be sought, as Jacques Delors had already proposed.A decision -making system with more efficiency, clarity, transparency and democracy could be created.I hope that the Commission will submit its own proposal to how the institutional and other differentiation of the expanding Union should be implemented.Ms. President, Mr Commission President, Dear Commissioners!From her inspiring speech, Mr. Prodi, I let myself be tempted.It arouses expectations, but can also disappoint.This is due to the discrepancy between words and deeds, which Mr. Van Velzen has just pointed out.The expansion of the Union is supported by our desire for peace, security and stability.They want to calm the accession countries as well as the European public.However, we can convince ourselves with our own eyes how the exact opposite occurs today.Fear and unrest also spread in the regions that are almost spared and unemployed.As Mr. Swoboda says, and so I agree with him, we have to convey the feeling of our citizens that they can feel at home.Here is the same values ​​to us, and here everyone knows their tasks and responsibilities.This is probably due to the norms mentioned by Mr. van Dam.That is subsidiarity.Clearly defined powers at all decision -making levels, partnership instead of competition in politics.It is as possible for the citizens where transparency is preserved and the citizens themselves have the possibility of control.This requires a new political culture, not only in theory, but also in practice, which is based on reality in the member states and regions.Regions that are sometimes equally equal due to their cultural and economic importance.The new Europe must not only develop into the width, its progress must also go deep by actually living our values ​​and driving the democratic structure of a real community.The Commission will have to be measured by this.Ms. President, the Commission, today presents our strategic goals for the years 2000-2005 in an extremely general document, in which all sticking points are covered in order not to scare any side too much.In the first part you will of course not find the words federal or super state anywhere about the new European decision structures.However, these terms are inevitably emerging when there is talk of strong European institutions in which only the ongoing executing activities are decentralized and that develop their collective vision in a confused structure in which the governments and national parliaments are mixed with the regional and even local authorities and civil society, all of which without any ranking - ""Integral component of the EuropeanDecision structures ""."	de
"Therefore, the European Union has to be clearly related to the current situation in Austria..(SV) We voted for the joint resolution to give our solidarity with all expression that is exposed to xenophobia and racism, and also in protest against the loyal policy for which Jörg Haider stands.However, we reject the methods of the 14 Member States on this question.The resolution lacks a clear indication of the respect for national identity and legal traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.We also miss a point for the joint responsibility of the EU for social and political development in Europe and Austria, which was one of the prerequisites for Haider's election success.Right -wing extremism - today, as in the previous history of Europe - is the result of uncertain social and economic living conditions.The austerity policy carried out in the course of the WWU adjustment has promoted the success of right-wing extremism.A radical policy for security and justice in every country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.- I give this explanation on behalf of the CSU group.It is unbearable that the EU interferes in the government formation of a Member State.This is not entitled to the EU.Instead of making a prejudice of the FPÖ and the government of Austria, a critical examination and evaluation of the government declaration and the party program and the policy of the coalition are required.Only after such a critical examination of the future policy of the parties in coalition discussions can be decided whether this government contradicts the democratic spirit of Europe.This does not mean that we sympathize with Haider.The CSU European MPs have no sympathy for the FPÖ boss Haider.As a politician, we have to ask ourselves why 27 % of the Austrian population chose a party like the FPÖ in October 1999.We have to deal with the reasons for this and try to remove the reasons that lead to such results.Only an examination of the arguments and politicians of the FPÖ can prevent the radicalization of politics in Austria.The resolution of the European Parliament, on the other hand, does not question the reasons for the Austrian election result and shows no possible solution.For these reasons, the CSU European group group speaks against this resolution.""Because he knew what this happy crowd was unknown and what it says in the books: that the plague bacillus never dies out or disappears, but can slumber in the furniture and laundry for decades, that he is waiting patient in rooms, basements, carpenters, handkerchiefs and old papers and may come to the accident and the plague to the misfortune and again.Submit so that they die in a happy city.That racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear of the other and its rejection, which have their roots in the lowest essential features of humans, can revive at any time in any group of people and to gain domination."	de
Mr President, so I want to repeat that for our part, we have discussed the action plan for the next five -year period and that we are ready when Parliament so decides this week if it is a parliamentary decision to present this five -year program and next month for 2000, as specifically agreed. I suggest that we will be voted on at the request of the Socialist Group, which aims to re -enter the Commission's statement of the Commission's strategic objectives.(Parliament rejected the request.) President. Still, for Wednesday's session, I have another proposal related to the oral issue of capital tax. The PPE-de group asks for removal of this section from the agenda. Does one of the colleagues want to use the group on behalf of the group and justify this request? Mr President because I hear a little laughter among the socialist group - I was told that many of the members of the Socialist Group also want to remove this point from the agenda because the Presidency's vote was not available from the voting of the Socialist Group. I do not know if this information is correct, but we, as a PPE-de group, would be grateful anyway if this point was removed from the agenda because Parliament has already dealt with this several times. Decisions have also been made against such a tax. Therefore, my group is asking for removal of this point from the agenda. Thank you, member of Poettering. Now we are listening to a member Wurtz, who speaks against this request. Mr President, first I would like to emphasize the illogicality of a member of poettering. He recently launched the Socialist Group because the group would have canceled an extremely clear decision at the Presidential Assembly. Now he does the same. We discussed and was unanimous with the exception of the PPE group and the liberal group, and then I even pointed out you, my good presidential colleague, you probably remember that it is not if you are so-called. Against Tobin tax or not, but that you dare to understand what the Commission and the Council think about it. This is not too much required. Thus, I hold on to the proposal that we preserve this oral question to the Commission and the Council to finally know the population of the two of this relatively modest proposal, which, however, would mean an important signal in the direction of public opinion, especially after the emotions aroused by the Seattle Summit failure. We vote at the request of the PPE-de group to preserve the oral issue of capital tax on the agenda.(Parliament rejected the request: 164 on behalf of, 166 and 7 empty. Thanks. Mr President, has my voice been taken into account, even though it did not go through electronically because I don't have a voting card? I voted for. If we add the speeches of both registered colleagues, we really get a result ... Mr President, the vote has been declared. Changes cannot be made. Mr President, in the former vote, and I will follow what you say about the Commission's strategic plan, I stated that I wanted to speak before the vote for my group. This did not happen. I would be grateful if I could give a voting statement for my group after this issue was dealt with. This is an important thing. It would be an advantage for Parliament that, in the light of their own political analyzes, members could express how they approach what we have just accomplished. Mr President, I do not want to reopen the debate, but I also asked for a speech to take a stand on the request of Barón Crespo. You didn't ask me to talk about either. I apologize for it, but the vote has been made and the decision is made, so let's let it be. I'm sorry, member of Häsch and Member Cox, I didn't see that you asked for a speech. Thus, I believe that the positions are quite clear and that they are recorded in the minutes.	fi
"Mr President, for the importance of financial support in Cyprus and Malta there are minimal differences of opinions. The issue that arises is from which category of budget this assistance should be funded. The Council and the Commission propose the protocols to fall into Category 4. This agrees with the decision to budget Parliament in the past December. The rapporteur, however, changes his mind and calls for the accession of Cyprus and Malta into Category 7. In fact, the Budget Committee proposes to postpone the approval of the BROK report until the Council agrees to increase the financial limits for category 7. This is essentially a dangerous strategy. Without the approval of Parliament, the financial protocols cannot begin to apply. Cyprus Malta, in this way, becomes the subject of a political game between the Council and Parliament on the level of boundaries. In addition, what is the meaning of the existence of financial limits, when they are increasing for each new action? For this reason, I would like to ask for € 15m, according to the Commission's proposal, to join category 4. As for the credits for the coming years, a budget for more years on the part of the Commission, then this year, could give a definitive answer. Mr President, throughout the world, efforts are being made to resolve chronic conflicts and the approach of communities that are separated by history and old racial hatreds and hatreds. Now the time has come to devote our time and our energy to help the Cypriots on both sides of the ""green line"" to find a solution to the conflict, which has been too long now. We all know that special care is needed to ensure that Cyprus successfully joins the European Union, and the decisions taken in Helsinki give an additional dimension to this debate, given Turkey's acceptance as a candidate. I hope that the decisions made in Helsinki will lead to the Cyprus issue. I hope this marks a new era of hope for Cyprus. I hope Turkey is beginning to play a constructive role in the Cyprus issue. I am pleased to listen to the words of the Council and the Commission to the United Nations, as well as the efforts made to encourage close talks between the two communities to promote reconciliation and restore confidence between the two communities in Cyprus. I warmly applaud the support of the Committee on the Bi -zonal, bicommunal, federal Cyprus for which the United Nations has been campaigning for so long, for which both the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot side have to work hard. I applaud the re -war of relations between the Greek and Turkish government. I hope this has an encouraging effect on talks on Cyprus. I hope that the pre -tax funds available to support Cyprus are partially used to promote this reconciliation and restore trust, and also both sides of the separate communities in Cyprus to accept and use this money in the spirit with which they are given."	el
Thank you very much Mr. Barnier.You have answered the questions in concrete terms and opened the dialogue you have discussed about Europe.Today you gave a very good example of compliance with the speaking time.The pronunciation is closed.Question time (Commission) According to the agenda, the question time follows (B5-0009/2000).We treat the inquiries to the Commission.Part I Inquiry No. 36 of (H-0025/00): concerns: infant mortality in Kosovo according to the youngest figures sent to the United Nations by the World Health Organization, the highest infant number of Europe is recorded in Kosovo;Almost 50 % of premature births die, while due to the war there is a steep increase in the miscarriage and the children who are held, despite everything, are not physically developed so well.Can the Commission - given the humanitarian aid of the European Union and the efforts of the special representative Bernard Kouchner - indicate which measures were taken to protect the right of women on motherhood and the health of pregnant women, weekers and infants in Kosovo?Mr. President, the Commission is the very difficult situation in terms of health and medical facilities in Kosovo, and not only for pregnant women, but in general.This situation is the result of both the latest conflict and years of neglect that preceded him.The figures mentioned in the area of ​​child mortality speak a eloquent language and cannot be accepted.But the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.The Commission has taken the following measures: First, the healthcare system receives comprehensive support from Echo.The focus is on supplying medical aid and medical assistance, support for health institutions and vaccination measures.However, we are increasingly based on the creation of a self -supporting system of health care in the province.This process is largely supported by Unmik.Second, the first urgent measures were carried out in the Mitrovica hospital as part of the reconstruction program, with funds of one million euros being used from the renovation program.Due to the tense relationships between the ethnic groups in this divided city, the work is slow.Thanks to the support from Unmik, however, the Commission can continue its aid measures as part of this project.We hope that this project will one day develop into a symbol of ethnic reconciliation.Based on the community of damage by the community, the costs for the reconstruction of the health facilities and the equipment of pharmacies and clinics are estimated at EUR 4 million.The Commission is now aiming for program planning for the funds for 2000.We assume that u.a considerable sum for the reconstruction of the healthcare system will be provided.The focus will be on long -term reforms that will have the financing of health care, training and order system on the subject.Together with Unmik, it is currently being examined to what extent the Commission can participate in these measures.Mr. Commissioner!Among other things, Commission President President President President President emphasized this morning that in the Balkans, our ability to act efficiently is put to the test that the credibility of the European Union itself is at stake and that the gap between words and deeds must finally be bridged.Do not think, Mr. Commissioner, that the present information about the high infant and child mortality rate in Kosovo - the highest in all of Europe - as well as the image of human misfortune and the destruction that is offered in Kosovo, already severely impairs our credibility and questions our ability to put promise into practice?	de
.(FR) I am very pleased to receive these two proposals for a directive to facilitate the free mobility of third -country citizens and at the same time facilitate the free provision of services. What is essential for these proposals is to introduce the provision of services to provide an EC card, which will allow, in the future, a third-country citizen of a third country who is legally resident in the European Union Member State in the future may provide services in other Member States, which many problems such as visa and work permit today are difficult. The first proposal for a directive will give companies in a Member State who have employees from a third -country country of employment, permission to send these hired employees to another Member State for a fixed period so that they can provide their services there. These regulations are that the employer can simply apply for an EC card to provide services to each employee. It follows that the employee must be legally resident in a Member State and must be part of the social security system in order to grant such a card. The second proposal grants the same rights to those third countries who are self -employed. Although in the basics I support proposals from the European Commission, it is true that some regulations may cause ambiguity. That's why I vote for the reviews proposed by the rapporteur. They make the regulations clearer and prevent any abuse! Some reviews aim to simplify administrative procedures, for example, by authorizing Member States to determine the granting of cards to only one authority. Such a change would, in my opinion, be necessary to avoid the proper application of new regulations too often to avoid administrative pregnancy. So I can do nothing but be happy about accepting the checks I changed;Indeed, it should not be allowed to allow people who are legally in the European Union to face so many difficulties. This is, contrary to the basic non -discrimination principle of the basic agreements of our Union. Marinho report (A5-0003/2000) :.(SV) The task of the impending inter -governmental conference is to reform the EU before receiving new Member States. Therefore, of course, we support the fact that the European Parliament is now officially showing the green light to start the inter -governmental conference. However, we believe that the inter -governmental conference must restrict the issues that are essential in order to implement the expansion. We also emphasized this in November 1999 and that is why we want to refer to the voting explanation we issued on November 18, 1999..(FR) The European Parliament is recently urged in a statement on the start of the next inter -governmental conference to commence the process of renewing the Treaties. This attempt to chant nations with the heavier text of national laws also appeared in the first meetings of the group, which is responsible for drawing up a so -called fundamental right of fundamental rights, which is, in fact, a false dressing law. In addition, this desire is reflected in today's incomprehensible efforts of the European Parliament to overturn the result of the free elections of Austria by resolution. This same attempt to make nations alone subordinate administrative areas can also be seen on all text pages prepared by the Commission for the inter -governmental conference. The leading idea is to make the votes -based majority -based and at the same time change the character of the qualified majority by making it in line with two simple majority rule, in order to increase the commission's maneuver and reduce the leeway of minority states. By the way, the French will also be interested in knowing that the Commission requires a change in Article 67 of the Amsterdam Treaty in order to record both majority decisions and the joint decision with the Parliament. We well remember that in this article, which concerned the transfer of immigration policy to the community, it was stipulated that decisions would be made unanimously in the Council for five years and then consider whether the system might be changed. Both the French National Assembly and the Senate members were assured when confirmed by the agreement that in any case, the Council could freely choose and adhere to consensus. Currently, this same union minister, Barnier, Commission's Member of the Commission, who was preparing the Amsterdam agreement and, in the meantime, a member of the European Commission, suggests that the next inter -governmental conference would decide that the Council will act on the basis of majority decisions in these matters.	fi
Madam President, Mr Prodi, if you had to face immediate elections, what kind of report would you make for your policy, for your work program, what would your criteria be? You had the good and charming idea that the result and the criteria for your policy and your five -year program will be significantly in the election result or in the participation of voters in the next European elections. If I think I have to explain your work program to my voters, whom I see every week - not at the high levels of planning and practicing important policy, but on the road - then I ask what I could tell them. Mr Prodi, what can I tell them that the character of the new one? Your work program contains nothing new. For five years you needed 12 pages. For the one year work schedule you needed 18 pages. Should this give me hopes for the year 2000? No, it doesn't make me optimistic. In the 2000 work schedule you say something very smart. You say that the environmental case should be incorporated into all areas of politics. Did you do that, Mr. Prodi? Did you read your work schedule for this year? You didn't. You have not integrated environmental policy into your report on enlargement, although it will be one of the main problems in the issue of enlargement. You have not integrated it into economic policy, competition policy or internal market policy. You didn't incorporate it anywhere. You linked individual excerpts of a scene, but you did not create a comprehensive unity. You have previously said in your speech that environmental disasters such as the Danube should be a trigger for a program that will concern these disasters. In this case I tell you no, Mr. Prodi! We must finally begin to apply the legislation and ensure that it controls it. You are writing in your five -year program that citizens of the European Union are expecting justified improved food specifications as well as improved relevant legislation. Mr Prodi, you don't know what you are talking about! The European Union's legislation on food is the most ambitious legislation in the world. What is missing is its national transfer and control. Finally take your duties and grab the Member States from the ear and have to perform their duties and fulfill their obligations. You should not only deal with your hobbies, but perform your daily normal work. This is what we expect from you over the next five years. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, you are very difficult for me to life, Mr Prodi, as Chairman of the Fisheries Committee of this Parliament. I am forced to publicly denounce the absence of fishing today from the program you presented to us. In the next five years of the Prodi Committee - you are solemnly announcing to us in the first of your conclusions - will mean big changes. I hope these changes that you announce to us do not constitute even greater marginalization of fishing, judging by the glaring and absolute silence with which you respond to your program.	el
"Isn't it time that the Turkish government cancel the economic blockade against Armenia?President!I would like to thank the representative of the council presidency for his answer.However, I am a little sad that you can see this bilaterally at first, but ultimately there is a large triangular ratio.We give partnerships and have cooperation agreements to help Armenia, and yet the help cannot be effective because Turkey carries out an economic blockade, so that many things for the Armenians cannot go on at all.Turkey is negotiating because of the possible accession, and it is in our interest that every state who wants to become a member also maintains friendly relationships at its border with its neighbors.Can't you influence Turkey more to enable peaceful development to enable the Armenians to develop that is necessary for the progress of the cooperation?Ms. MPs, you are right if you say that we have to use the relationship with Turkey that the country mentioned can play a constructive role in this situation and, above all, are part of the solution and no longer part of the problem.Precisely because Turkey has taken a new path in its relationships with the European Union and because Turkey is now also confronted with the need to have to give an answer to the positions of the European Union in the field of common foreign and security policy, we - this do not need to be concealed - will examine the intentions of Turkey with regard to the priorities of the European Union in its external relationships.Of course, relationships with Armenia also have one of these external relationships by the agreement concluded last year.We think that Turkey, if it wants to share the basic values ​​of the European Union and the general framework of the relationships of the European Union - and regardless of the special bilateral conditions that it can have with other country - generally behave according to the basic norms that the European Union uses in its external relationships.We also assume that this question will form one of the focus in the bilateral relationships between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.Since they concern similar topics, inquiries No. 5 and 6 are answered together.Inquiry No. 5 of (H-0031/00): concerns: tightening the situation in Kosovo The genocide of the Serbs and other ethnic groups in Kosovo, apart from the Albanian, continues and accepts even greater proportions.Even Mr. Kouchner recently explained that the political situation and the security situation in Kosovo were anything but good.In addition, it is pointed out that the UN resolution 1244 is not used and that in particular is violated against its provisions that contain guarantees for all residents of Kosovo.Rather, the extreme, separatist forces are encouraged, which culminates in the fact that the former Uck guide, H. Thaqi, appointed Kosovo as ""preliminary prime minister"" and the Uck was declared ""protection force for Kosovo"".What does the Council intend to do in view of this situation so that the UN resolutions and in particular the resolution 1244 are used and a separation of the province of Kosovo from Serbia is prevented?"	de
I myself have mentioned different possible responses to this challenge, which consists for all of us to recall, to demonstrate again what we have been doing together since 1957: economic community of course, but first community of values ​​and charter of fundamental rights which will protect more clearly and more clearly citizens;Article 13 of the Treaty, relating to discrimination, of which we proposed, in our opinion of January 26, even before the Austrian crisis, that it was governed, after the CIG, by the qualified majority and no longer by unanimity;The possible hypothesis, I say possible - I say it personally - to complete article 7 by a new paragraph which would endow the procedure for monitoring or democratic alert with a legal basis and then, finally, public debate.The only way to back up bad ideas is to express others.I thus come back to our discussion, at the moment, I deeply believe in the value and the democratic force of the debate, in particular to fight demagoguery.Mr. Commissioner Barnier, you have strongly insisted, in your declaration, on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.As for the CIG, you know that under Helsinki's decisions, the Portuguese presidency was granted the specific right to expand the agenda of the CIG in the course of this conference.It is clear that parliament will have its own representatives, MM.Brok and tsatsos.However, the Commissioner, would you also be able to make the commitment, if the agenda is extended by the Council, to refer to the Parliament so that we can debate it in our bosom but also with you, and this in order to continue this dialogue with the citizens on which you insisted so much?.Mr. Beazley, my answer is clearly yes, but it is not frankly new.President Napolitano and many members of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, and even more deputies, here, in plenary session, know that I will be available to say, on behalf of the Commission, throughout this negotiation, in a spirit of transparency and in real time, how things are going.I may say it differently from Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, who are your direct representatives.It is also likely that, in many circumstances, we will say it together.I believe very important that this negotiation is not clandestine, neither with regard to the European Parliament nor with regard to national parliaments, which I remind you that in the end, they will have their opinion to give and their positions to be taken in the process of ratification.This is why I paid tribute to the initiative of Mr. Napolitano of joint, regular consultation, between national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament.That said, the duty of transparency and debate begins here, about the reform of institutions.So, I will be available whenever you want to realize our positions and the progress of this negotiation throughout the starting year.Mr. President, I first compliment the Commission for his approach.I think it is really very good to start dialogue with the citizen as soon as possible because, to tell the truth, it did not take place in the wake of the Amsterdam Treaty and the Maastricht Treaty and it only led to great distrust.	fr
"This goal of minimizing the contradictions is a fair and reasonable goal to which the decision is geared.In my opinion, the idea of ​​setting up an observation center for the development of this coherence between the community policies and cooperation and development policy is quite obvious and relevant.Your field of action must not be limited to the community policies, but must also include the measures or policies of the Member States, including the measures of economic groups, which I consider important.This observation center should develop a report on the development and effects of these policies and their connection annually.For the conclusion, I canceled a question that, in my view, is of fundamental importance and must be checked and confirmed by this parliament.Our goal of reducing the contradictions between cooperation and development policy and the other policies to a minimum measure must not only be valid within the European Union, but because of the increasing globalization of the economy.If we want to achieve fair world trade, we have to enforce the same principle in the next multilateral round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization because it would be a contradiction if the European Union imposed an iron, although fair discipline, only so that the United States and other great powers then do the opposite and exploit what we do not do.It is therefore correct and necessary that these principles are determined at the next round of the world trade organization.Mr. President, the general director of the general directorate responsible for development, said a report on the coherence of the various Union politics with development policy before the document due in the spring was presented with developmental policy, would mean that the horse was foamed from behind.It is irrelevant that the claim to the Commission, which was clearly defined in the decision of the Council, was only met with a ""non-paper"".The real problem is that at a time when poverty increases worldwide, this horse climbs the mountain and the cart on which the other EU policies are unloaded is so heavy that development policy slowly slips backwards.Development policy is constantly forgotten or considered an appendix if the most important political decisions of the European Union are made.For example, take the new chocolate directive, which shows that the EU countries spend more for chocolate every year than for development aid.A proper assessment of the development policy effects of this guideline did not take place, which according to the producer of the 90 % of our AKP partners could lead to income losses for the cocoa producers of at least 15 %.Let us take the fishing agreements that show how little the current fishing practice is in the EU waters.At the same time, we negotiate joint ventures, which are intended to give the large European fishing vehicles an extended access to the waters of developing countries, and which will lose their work in these countries worldwide.Let's take the trade agreement.As Mr. Nielson said this morning with regard to the Lomé Agreement, the preference regulation only applies to ""essentially all products of the least developed countries"".In other words, poverty fighting becomes meaningless as soon as it comes to the commercial interests of the EU."	de
"This strategy, formed in Cologne on June 10, 1999, is comprehensively examined by the Southeastern European area, but also recognizes the differences and unevenness of the development of numerous countries. The European Union's investment in the stabilization agreement is the so-called ""stabilization and association process"", which continues to develop a regional procedure developed by the European Community in 1996, which concerned the five countries in the region: Bosnia and Hertzegovina, Croatia, Yugoslavian Federation Republic, former Yugoslavia's equivalent of Medicine and Albania. Its main importance was to establish political and economic conditions to support the implementation of the Dayton Peace Treaty, which would thus contribute to regional stability. The fact that we establish relations between the Macedonia of the European Union and the former Yugoslavia Republic of Yugoslavia on a whole new basis and to open up the view of that country to join the EU structure with the help of a stabilization and association mechanism according to EU structures is therefore an important contribution to the stability of the Balkan region. This requires that the countries are ready to accept the terms of a particular set. We look forward to providing them with a politically important message about the possibility that one day they will be part of us, of course, with respect for their own self -determination. The authorization we give here today to the Commission may turn out to be exaggerated, once the agreement has been concluded, the first big step that the tested area has already reasonably shown that they want to belong to our area of ​​freedom and development has taken peace and stability. Their suffering under the yoke of the Council and the price they had to pay for the forced subscription to the Communist States group is quite sufficient. Based on what we have learned, the former Republic of Yugoslavia Macedonia, in politically and economically, is capable of creating new contractual relationships with the European Union that extends to a broader cooperation agreement that enters into force on June 1, 1998. It is true that the former Yugoslav Republic's Macedonia still has to work hard, but when looking at political and economic reforms carried out within the framework of the cooperation agreement and taking into account the acceptance of transition periods in certain areas, this country may in the future will be able to fulfill the terms of stability and assosy agreement. In favor of the view that the region's development is a stabilizing factor, defining the negotiation mandate in accordance with the conditions proposed for us and emphasizing that this is a bilateral agreement with the European Union, we will associate with the opinion of the rapporteur that for the first time applying the long-term and comprehensive strategy of Southeastern Europe, and that the central issue isas a guaranteed area. In this context, different references to regional cooperation between neighboring countries are truly political. This agreement must work and can work, such as other countries in the area. And that's why it's particularly important. The key is that it would be a real political will behind this process to bring the European Union and those countries to each other. We must not be ignored that some of them are establishing democracy, some still have to strengthen the democraticism of their state, and in some, the balance depends on the presence of soldiers in the area, but they are countries where they are now aware that after winning the bridge, they can finally bring them together with the European Union. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good colleagues, I am not going to join my colleagues with a unanimous choir. I think this report is some kind of masterpiece of hypocrisy. Section 4 praises the exemplary of this agreement. We know that there are a total of 13 applicants between Lithuania and Turkey and that the only black hole in Europe is located in Balkan countries. And even though we refuse the Balkan countries the possibility of the status of an applicant, we believe that the agreement is excellent."	fi
Virtually all reviews approved by the Commission are included in a common position. The common position is harmonized by the minimum requirements for the safety advisers, and in the second processing, we can accept a review of the proposed entry into force of the entry into force, so that the deadline is much more realistic than the Commission's original proposal, especially given that we have been discussing this issue for several years. I would also like to thank the various members for their speeches and tell them that the focus of the Commission is on safety. It can never be taken for granted, achieved and ended as a process, as Member Simpson said very well. Raising requirements and safety guarantees in the field of traffic is a process that has to be ever better. In this sense, I also want to mention very briefly about tunnel problems - which members Rack and Swoboda also referred to - which are undoubtedly a very difficult thing in Austria, and that is why we have to make an effort to come up with how to increase tunnel safety. The goods transported for major accidents in one recent accident in itself were not dangerous in itself. Margarine and a few pounds of goals that did not initially seem to be associated with any risk caused a real catastrophe. Therefore, one should ensure how to further raise the requirements to ensure the best possible safety. Finally, I would like to say that the safety of all modes of transport must be considered. This week, we will discuss the safety of sea transport here due to the disaster caused by the Erika ship, and the intention is to discuss the safety targets of air transport this year. However, I would like to say that safety is that security is the primary objective of the Commission. As I will say in the debate on the Erika platform, we do not wait for a disaster until we take safety in safety, but work in the conditions that are in favor of safety that only shows us how urgent it is to respond to this type of problems effectively. Once again, I would like to thank everyone who made their speech, and especially the rapporteur Koch. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered tomorrow at 12 noon. The road transportation of dangerous substances on the agenda is the next Koch's Report on the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee (A5-0104/1999) on the proposal of the European Parliament and of the Council for Directive of Dangerous Member States on Directive 94/55/EC (1999)C5-0004/1999 - 1999/0083 (COD)).- (de) Mr President, Member of the Commission, Good Colleagues, January 1, 1997 Directive for the approximation of the legislation of the law of hazardous road transport, which entered into force on the road to dangerous substances, contains some transitional provisions, which are limited and linked to the completion of certain standardization work for the European standard. The delays in Cen's work are now causing problems to apply this directive. Especially the attachments cannot be adapted in accordance with technical and industrial development. I apologize for this because we have to take action because others have not made their own share. As far as I am accepting the proposal 94/55/EC, a proposal to be discussed today and to be discussed today. The inactivity of the European Union would oblige Member States to change their national provisions for a short period of time, until Cen has been completed, which causes unnecessary costs and uncertainty. Thus, the amendment of the directive on today's agenda does not cause any changes to the harmonization of hazardous substances by the Community. It only extends the transition rules by delaying deadlines, deleting outdated regulations, and providing procedures applied to temporary transportation of hazardous substances (so -called AD HOC transportation) and (b) in the issue of more loose national regulations in particular. Changing the Directive is therefore completely in line with the principle of subsidiary, as Member States gain more powers. The Commission decides whether or not Member States can issue certain own regulations. In this context, the Commission is supported by the Committee on Transportation of Dangerous Goods in accordance with the regulatory procedure.	fi
We must give them a chance. This is the moral duty of the EU and all of us. As a solution, I see a clear encouragement of entrepreneurship. By entrepreneurship, I do not mean just owning a business, but I mean the will. I mean the attitude, that one wants to move forward in his life, whether he is an employee, owner or official. What is a fair society? One where a person from modest circumstances can move forward in their lives so that his or her children would be a little easier. This is also possible to develop the regions, as people will try and work if they are given the opportunity. Finally, I would say that in this respect, we should learn from America, where diligence is still in fashion and success is a proven to be qualified and not the subject of envy, as we often have in Europe. Mr President, Member of the Commission, a good colleague, because the seconds I use are calculated carefully, I will go right away. First, one note: the fruits of growth are not fairly divided within the Union. One example of this is the most outrageous areas, which are severely affected by severe unemployment. For example, the unemployment rate is 37 % in the sea -off Réunion Department. However, this situation is not due to business cycles but is due to structures. This is because we are off and live on the island, that is to say, it is due to our own special nature. In order to improve the state of affairs, Article 299 (2) of the Amsterdam Treaty was recorded in the principle of special and exceptional treatment. In practice, this principle is still ahead. The publication of the document of the Commission, declared December 1999, was postponed to January and then to February, and the first thoughts presented in it did not arouse optimism in me. So I will immediately make a vigorous petition to the Council and the Commission. In terms of taxation, state aid, structural funds and our traditional products, we need to urgently come up with bold and ambitious concrete actions. Unfortunately, if this does not happen, convergence and cohesion are just a word of word for us, and it can be feared that structural policy in our areas will end with the failure, despite the significant amount of money spent on it..(Fr) Mr President, like other speakers, I would like to thank the rapporteur Berendi and congratulate him for his quality work. Like the previous report, this highly valid and accurate analysis, the recommendations made on the basis of it and your own observations, ladies and gentlemen, are useful for both the Commission as a whole and especially for a member of the Commission, especially for the regional policy, especially now that we are planning the 2000-2006 appropriations. For my part, I would like to make some observations, firstly, for what applies to you, a good rapporteur, your perceptions of the sixth seasonal report. You have emphasized its quality and you even wrote if I am not mistaken that it is clearly better than their predecessors compared to earlier stories. On behalf of all the Commission officials and my predecessor, Wulf-Mathies, I would like to tell you that we can appreciate the parliament quite well and the praise you have given. It is true that it is particularly important to the Commission, the rapporteur Berend that in this sixth seasonal report we can see that the issue has been made and that the analysis of your handled has been qualitatively forwarded. By this I mean, in particular, the content of the story 2.1 of the report, in which the Commission has considered more profoundly the financial definitions of regional competitiveness and sought to explore the extent to which this competitiveness can be supported, and how it can be influenced by the factors that some of you were quite enthusiastic, such as Markov or member of Raschhofer. I mean technical research and development, the needs and quality of infrastructure, the opportunities hidden in human resources, small and medium-sized companies, direct investments abroad. This should be noted in terms of quality. Now, I do not want a good rapporteur, to lose my time by presenting my perceptions too detailed in terms of the general issues that Parliament has already joined.	fi
Mr. President, this debate was very useful.One or two speakers have referred to specific questions on which we were strongly advised to think carefully.For example, Mrs. Maij-Weggen spoke about both Indonesia and Burma and made some important comments on these countries and on the human rights situation there.I would like to focus very briefly on one or two subjects that were regularly raised during the debate.One of the very first speakers, Mr. Wuori, spoke of the remarks that Mr. Havel made today.This speech was remarkable and I hope that Mr. Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, could also hear it.I also hope, if there is a life in space, as Mr. Newton Dunn supposedly, that she too could hear the speech of Mr. Havel.The latter reminded us that our Union does not only concern markets, the growth of the PNB, that it is a union of values ​​which is reflected in the treaties and in our obligations at the level of external aid as a whole, which is reflected quite specifically in what we are responsible for doing.How do we work what the treaties that are talking about development aid programs say?One or two honorable parliamentarians, MM.Feber and Cushnahan spoke of the ditch that separates the rhetoric from reality.Mr. Cashman said, and he is right in a sense, that words do not replace real action.Of course, words can make a little difference, as Ms. Malmström pointed out.She said she received a letter from the Chinese ambassador, a very kind and very intelligent representative and servant of her country, to tell her that she was wrong and that the European Parliament adopted a bad attitude towards human rights in China.I think that after her speech, she will receive a mountain of letters from the Chinese authorities.She will be able to fill a cabinets with binders with letters concerning what is said to be the real situation in China.I think she reflected the views of many non -governmental organizations, many people who admire Chinese civilization but who are concerned about what is happening in China today.Obviously, it is quite true that we must consider an action and the very first speech, run by Mr. Salafranca, mentioned two distinct subjects of Geneva and which concerned actions.One of them is of course made possible thanks to the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of European taxpayers - namely the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - around 100 million euros which are spent through programs, of which I am responsible, and which go mainly to non -governmental organizations in order to promote human rights and democratization.We will have to share with Parliament, as the vicars say, our points of view on the best way to focus and target this expenditure program aimed at supporting human rights in the years to come.	fr
"This is the level of sophistication and provisions I would like.All I can do for the moment is promise that I will try to get there.Let me first wish a good Saint-David to the Commissioner.Thank you for this presentation.It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a real waste of time unless contact is restored with European citizens.This is what we must focus fully at every moment.It must offer them a service and the recommendations aimed at reducing payment deadlines will certainly be certain, well welcomed, but the other complaint that the citizens we represent regularly for us regularly relates to the paperwork, an excessive paperwork.Is there a reference to a reduction in paperwork and bureaucracy for candidates for European financing with the guarantee of financial control?This is a precise complaint that reaches us.We must answer them.The other question I would like to ask the audit monitoring committee.This committee is, of course, welcome but I think it is essential that it understands a reference to the control of the recommendations of the European Parliament in our discharge procedure.Will you add that to the work of your audit monitoring committee?Finally, the group of socialists agrees with the establishment of the budget on the basis of activities and with empowerment, and you will be judged, as Mr. Prodi says, on the basis of your actions and not your words.The task of restoring contact between the Commission and European citizens is critical, as Morgan said.It can only be performed by acts and not words.I say it with a certain deference within the European Parliament because it has many speech experts, but we will try to give an example.Regarding excessive paperwork, Ms. Morgan explained the dilemma.We hate excess paperwork, but given the requirements of control, additional control and retrification aimed at ensuring effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of the administration, that some name ""bureaucracy"", are inevitable.However, with a view to reducing these obligations as much as possible, we are not just talking about it;We will appoint, in the fairly close future, an assistant secretary general, an additional assistant secretary general who will have the mandate and as a specific task of identifying best practices and disseminating them within the Commission;He will also have to guarantee a radical reduction in procedures, a cause of so much paperwork, so much bureaucracy and, I would also say, so much frustration, not only at the level of the citizens and the companies of the Union, but also of all the people who work for the Commission.Admittedly, we will endeavor to achieve it and I think that the effects will begin to be felt in the coming years.One of our difficulties will always be, of course, that the more effective we will be in terms of reform, the less people will know.So, we will count on our friends and our European Parliament partners to explain, with their usual generosity, all the efforts that the Commission undertakes in order to serve the citizens of Europe correctly."	fr
Madam Rothe, I will formulate it as follows: I believe that conditions have a clear improvement to make such agreements. At the moment I have no positive answers, nor do I expect this before direct talks begin. This will be a little later. The terms framework changed because Helsinki's decisions made it possible for a whole series of things that were until then impossible and, above all,, of course, because the political strategies of those involved radically changed. I have always been in the opinion that the old position, that a prerequisite for the accession of Cyprus is to solve the political problem, has a weak point, and in particular that it is not a sufficient motivation to persuade the Turkish Cypriot community to participate in the process of integrating, because it was with this strategy to do so. At that time there was no possibility of becoming a Cyprus member of the EU. Now, he must seriously calculate the risk of Cyprus integration into the community and the opportunities for prosperity and security that the Greek Cypriot community would have, while the more prosperous Turkish Cypriot community would still remain. Therefore, I strongly believe that the motivation for combining the process of integrating with the resolution of the crisis has become much more powerful after Helsinki. This was also the corresponding reasoning. Lady colleague, it's been just a few weeks and it's still too early to judge, but at least I have no reason to assume that the new line will fail. There is no such indication. There is no indication yet to say that we will do it, but I can really say that the conditions to take a step forward have been significantly improved. The last point is this: Of course, the Cyprus issue plays a role in discussions with Turkey. During my meeting with the Turkish Foreign Minister a few weeks ago in Brussels, I of course asked Turkey to maintain a positive and constructive attitude on the issue. I just point out this: We cannot be completely sure - at least I'm not - that it is enough to press a button in Ankara to solve the issue of Cyprus! Things are no longer so simple at all. On the contrary, we need to make intensive efforts by chatting with the two communities to persuade them to come into consultation. We will do this and have the necessary means and programs. I must tell you clearly that we need the specific budgetary regulation that has been submitted here, so that we can make a start. The budgetary regulation is the legal framework for the predicted priorities to be prioritized in pre -accession corporate relations with Malta and Cyprus. I can't start nothing without him, because I miss the legal basis. If this has to do with the lack of cohesion for which complaints are expressed, I must say that this regulation is nothing more than a legal framework. What must be the content of the framework is the priorities of pre -accessible corporate relationships that were set by the Commission and the Council last year and now implemented in the corresponding planning and project management.	el
I listened to the Member of the Commission's Member of Vitorino and I have to say that I am happy: I think you answered the questions you have given to you. I, too, believe that we have to emphasize that it is important for the European Union, and therefore, to the Commission, to promote three level activities, in particular in terms of economic and funding, and in terms of different levels of scientific cooperation, so that our quantitative presence in financial terms can also become more significant political presence in the Middle East. This is, in my view, a homework that we have to learn from this long -time event. For this particular question, I just heard that colleague Galeote refers to our President and Colleague Menéndez del Vale, and the chairman of Prod, to Israel and other visits to the Middle East. In my opinion, both the President and the Commission chairman are properly excluded from their agenda: each thing has its own place, and of course, each level has to have its own primary goals. In my opinion, the two highest representatives of the Parliament and the Commission are properly handled in dealing with the most sensitive aspects of the peace process, as we know, there are still some difficulties in this process. We must definitely support this peace process, and the attention we will attach to the phenomena of colleague Morgantin's question is not prejudice or predetermined against any party: it is the harshness of a friend, the harshness that we demonstrate to the friendly government of Israel so that we could do soparties. When looking at the matter in this point of view, this initiative must be understood as a positive initiative to promote the peace process of the Middle East. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good colleagues, the current trade agreement between the Israeli and the European Community is indeed unclear. In addition, it is very difficult to determine the origin of the products in question. Therefore, I can only say that it would be desirable to get this issue quickly. However, we need to take into account a number of other important factors. Of course, we are all unanimous that the current revitalization of peace talks needs to be encouraged and not difficult. Israel and the Palestinians are currently eager to negotiate their future borders. Therefore, all kinds of companies made by anyone, any party, to define or, in particular, strive for a territorial application, are premature at this stage. In my opinion, it is better to wait for the result of the Israeli, the European Commission and the Palestinians, convening the tripartite team, concludes in the question of the rules for the origin of the products. I am pleased that a member of the Commission also agrees with me. Hopefully, the said team will find a temporary solution to the problem within the existing laws without compromising the peace process. Because this peace process is definitely worth prioritizing, and we will not get from the European community, from Europe, by no means disturbing it to the comparison. The Parliament seems to be considerable today, but I would like to bring a few things. Here in Parliament, trading with the Middle East has always been a attention-boring political topic. We are the most important financiers, but unfortunately we have been left over for too long about politics and political influence in the Middle East, and we can have a positive impact on our part, as many speakers have said today, just as we did in the case of Northern Ireland. We are one of the most important consumers of products from both Israel and occupied areas. Indeed, trade is probably the most important political in our region of political strength, and ensuring the promotion of the rule of law is our best political forces in trying to promote a peace treaty. Borders are closed, sometimes arbitrarily and sometimes as a result of a terrorist attack. One of my many visits to the area I have seen rotting flowers and strawberries along Gaza streets and donkeys them as their Palestinian producers are helpless and desperate. But it is not just about closed boundaries.	fi
So far, we have not seen any practical action on the spot itself. Mr President, I would like to tell you the views of some of our colleagues here, reflecting that two and a half months after the shipwreck, the situation in the area is very critical and that its extent is becoming more and more clearly revealed. There are two perspectives: firstly an environmental perspective. The wreck still contains 16,000 tonnes of heavy fuel oil, which is flowing into the sea, and unfortunately, in addition to these casting, we have detected and recorded 35 ecological crimes last week, 35 tanks that are shamelessly exacerbating this completely catastrophic situation. The Commission member de Palacio spoke for a long time about this problem, and I believe that he has promptly assigned what is now absolutely important, that is, the draft of the draft European Marine Transportation of Dangerous Subsitities. In this respect, he may again receive French support for his leadership of his leadership by accepting security settings. However, the second shock is experienced in the economic sector, first of all, the environment, secondly the economy, as many colleagues have brought up here. Simpus education, fishing, oyster and fish farming are now seriously threatened. In addition to the oil disaster, the storm caused damage in many areas. It is regrettable that these occupations have suffered terribly. On the one hand, they need to be rebuilt, and on the other hand, it is most difficult to achieve commercial trust. In order for the residents of Britagne, Vendée and Charente and elsewhere in the forest managers to survive this situation, they are now waiting for the lack of the European Union. At the same time, on the one hand, we cannot talk about this task as a means of bringing the Union closer to the citizens and on the other hand, not to address the practical level of such significant and extensive phenomena. I noted very closely the words of the Commission member Fischler, which are probably the most concrete words we have heard so far. Of course, expressions and information on compassion and solidarity have been presented, but now is the time to fulfill expectations by showing a precise form of European solidarity. Tanker Erika's oil spill is one of the devastating accidents that have occurred in recent years in the waters of the Community, including Braeri Oil Damage in front of Shetland Islands and off Sea Empress Wales. In addition to non -harmless ecological damage, these oil damage has caused the destruction of local industries. In the case of Erika, the local fishing and aquaculture industry has suffered a tough impact, and it is important that not only the harmful effects that are now visible, but that they also prepare for the long-term harmful effects of oil contamination. Proper compensation is necessary. It is time to improve shipping safety in the community area and to introduce stricter control and stop using comfort flagships. They have been increasingly used in the fishing industry. Responsible companies, shipping companies and cargo owners need to pay for their negligence. The current compensation fund does not have sufficient funds, which clearly emerged in the Braer's major accident, where the Shetland Islands' fishing industry received insufficient compensation for its losses. We need to learn from past events and ensure that Braeri's livelihoods can be restored. Mr President, Erika's disaster, has to be talked about again two and a half months after the accident happens, as its consequences have not yet been clarified. On the one hand, we now need to continue pressureing a Total company together with the organized population to replace everything that has been destroyed by its blatant winning, and on the other hand, it is absolutely committed to the fact that similar disasters will no longer be repeated. Although a joint resolution presentation is interesting, it does not address the problem of comfort flagships, which must be both aware and resolved urgently in order to prevent maritime accidents consistently. In fact, it is not so much that the safety flagship safety control should be improved, as it says in the resolution, but that now we have to work to remove these ships.	fi
We must take into account the advice of fishermen.We must take into account the concerns of fishermen and we must work closely with them.I hope that you will take into account, as a commissioner responsible for fishing that you will become aware of this ditch and that you will try to work as closely as possible for all parties to be united and for their opinions to be taken into account.Thank you, Mr. Commissioner Fischler.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.Insolvency procedures The agenda calls for the report (A5-0039/2000) of Mr. Lechner, in the name of the legal commission and the internal market, on the proposal for the settlement of the council relating to the insolvency procedures (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806 (CNS)).Mr. President, I believe that we are all agreement for the creation of a European judicial space.We also agree that there is harmonization in an area marked by an extreme disparity in our legal systems, and even more concepts.The very word of insolvency, the legal concept of insolvency, does not cover the same accounting notion in each of the Member States of the Union.So we agree on the observation, and the draft settlement and the report go in the right direction.If I may afford, I will make some observations, however, on the method.When we take note - and we could not do otherwise - of the disparity of legal systems and concepts, and that we want to go in the direction of better coordination, I believe that there are three ways to proceed.The first is to make equivalences saying: ultimately, insolvency in France is the same as insolvency in England or in Germany.The second way of proceeding is to recreate an ex nihilo law, that is to say to harmonize systems, to completely redesign all concepts and legal systems in each of the states.It is not the way that has been taken.The third way that was taken is finally to superimpose, above existing systems, which we do not touch, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and the company in difficulty.It is a good thing, and the result has probably exceeded the ambition of the authors.But at this stage I would like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and inspired by practice.It is that insolvency is experienced in the European Union, in most states, as an absolutely definitive event for the one who lives it.And I think that it is our responsibility, in an economy that goes faster and faster, where everyone must have their chance and have it really, to give the chance to try a commercial enterprise, and a second, a third chance if it is necessary.	fr
At the request of a French deputy, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has already been introduced;She has collected many signatures including mine.However, I ask you, in accordance with the orientation now constantly expressed by the European Parliament and the entire European Community, to intervene with the President and the Governor of Texas, Mr. Bush, by playing the prestige of your mandate and the institution that you represent, because it is Mr. Bush who has the power to suspend the death sentence and to pardon the condemned.And all this while respecting the principles that we have always supported.Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will gladly do it.It is indeed completely in the position line that our parliament has always adopted.Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that parliament has regularly taken care of.This is the case of Alexandre Nikitin.We all rejoice, in this enclosure, that the court pronounced its release and clearly established that in Russia too, access to environmental information was a constitutional right.However, it makes itself that it seems to be indictment again, the public prosecutor having appealed.We know, and we have also established it in many resolutions - including during the last period of last year - that this case is not only of a legal nature and that it is wrong to accuse Alexandre Nikitin of criminal activity and betrayal because we are concerned by his results and we take advantage of it.These results form the basis of European Barent Sea Protection programs and that is why I beg you to examine a letter project depicting the essential facts of this case and to communicate to Russia the position which stems from the decisions of the Parliament.Yes, Madame Schroedter, I will gladly examine the facts relating to this question when I have received your letter.Madam President, I would first like to congratulate you for having kept his word because indeed, in this first period of session, in this new year, the number of television channels has really been increased significantly in our premises.However, the president, what I asked for was not achieved.There are two Finnish channels and a Portuguese chain, but there is still no Dutch chain.Yet I asked you for a Dutch chain, because the Dutch people also wish to be able to follow the news each month when sent to this land of exile.I therefore ask you to do what is necessary so that we can have a Dutch chain.Mrs. Plooij-Van Gorsel, I can tell you that this question is on the agenda of the meeting of the quaestors on Wednesday.She will be, I hope, examined in a positive spirit.Madam President, how is it that Parliament does not comply with the regulations on health and security that it votes?How is it that no air quality test has been carried out in this building since our election?	fr
That is why we will vote against both of these proposals. Mr President, Mr. Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, I would first of all thank the rapporteur and colleague Wieland for their efforts to summarize the different amendments and the different interests with such homogeneity in the exhibition. These two proposals are an important contribution to the implementation of one of the four fundamental principles of the internal market and in particular to the implementation of freedom of service. The new arrangement for the provision of cross -border services will undoubtedly improve both the functioning of the internal market and the competitiveness and capacity of businesses for action. The strict terms of framework for granting - and here I will refer to Wieland's colleague - of the EU - EU Card - EU because they block violations such as illegal migration or virtual contracts. There are three reasons that make me consider this directive to be so important: the economic importance of the European Union of the labor potential from third countries, the competitiveness of businesses and the smooth operation of the domestic market. Therefore, on the one hand, I welcome the rigorous framework and on the other I call on the as possible and simply the controls that the Member States will carry out. Finally, I want to ask a question to the committee because they often ask me the same question. Is it the directive to influence accession negotiations? How will Article 1 be interpreted from your own point of view, since this is very important for my country that borders many new states with which accession negotiations are held? Mr President, Mr Commissioner, colleagues, we are talking about businessmen who have so far been obliged to find that two of the most important freedoms, free movement of persons and goods, did not apply in their case. Indeed, these people had to follow the endless bureaucratic processes applied to immigrants in the Member States where a service had to be provided. There are about 13 million citizens of third countries residing in the European Union. Although the exact number of entrepreneurs is not known, I suppose the percentage will not be insignificant. Consequently, Community legislation does not so far regulate the issue of access to these people throughout the territory of the European Union. The two directives we consider are aimed at promoting the free movement of services in the internal market by establishing an EU service card. I find it important to emphasize in this context that the issuance of the service card will be flexible in a flexible manner, and in particular five days after a simple statement,will have a limited power which will not be extended automatically. I also attended the reservations expressed by Mr Commissioner. After studying the amendments tabled, I found that we greatly agree with these reservations and that we will vote accordingly.	el
"I also have to answer the fact that there were reports during the discussion - and I use some of the words heard - in ambiguity, complacency and in the inability of the committee's opinion. I have a duty to say to parliament that there is neither ambiguity nor weakness or complacency in the opinion he expressed, nor of course in the action he took, the Commission in this matter. We explicitly stated yesterday morning, as did the president this afternoon that we share the concerns expressed fourteen Member States in their statement on Monday. Secondly, we clearly stated that we will work closely with all Member States to consider how the situation in Austria is evolving. Thirdly, we have said very categorically that we will support the values ​​and provisions of Article 6 of the Treaty fearlessly and impartial and that we will fulfill our duty under Article 7 of the Treaty, in order to ensure the protection of these values ​​of freedom and democracy as well as the foundations. There is no trace of complacency, weakness and ambiguity in all this. In addition, saying that this is the committee's view, I include my dear colleague Franz Fischler, who comes from Austria and who once again proved his integrity and independence as a member of the European Commission, justifying the statement we made last morning. Anyone who therefore invites Franz Fischler to somehow accountable for the fact that he is an Austrian should consider his own motivation in a debate that was necessarily shaded by references to xenophobia and even more dangerously suffering from this world. I say this with feelings of friendship and appreciation to my friend and colleague Franz Fischler. I would also like to add, Madam President, that understanding our position from the Presidency, the Portuguese Presidency, was demonstrated in the clearest way by Mr Da Costa when he said that ""Portugal and the other Member States do we want to ensure that the present situation will not affect it"". This is certainly in the interest of everyone. In order to ensure the defense of the Treaty, as well as our support for the Community machine, we follow the course of action we recorded in our statement yesterday. And we will continue to do so, Madam President, fearlessly and impartial. This is our duty. It is also a matter of beliefs. And one last observation. We understand the context of this important discussion. There are many here that, like me, have been familiar with Mr Haider's offensive statements for many years, with xenophobia that distinguishes many elements of his policy as well as his strategy to alternate threatening statements and apologies, sometimes even from day to day. We understand this, as we also remember the small and selective memory that sometimes characterizes Nazism. When we remember it, both me and my colleagues are of course exasperated, as well as many others on all aspects of this parliament."	el
I therefore ask you, the president, to ask the commission to express themselves now and that we then proceed to the vote.(Applause of the PSE group) Madam President, above all, I would like it to be clear that the Commission has the greatest respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, in particular, for that which concerns the fixing of the agenda.Therefore, we respect the decisions that Parliament could make in this direction.But I would also like it to be clear that the Prodi President has committed to the Parliament to establish a new debate, as recalled by Mr. Barón, which is added to the annual debate on the legislative program of the Commission, on the main lines of action for the next period of five years, that is to say for this legislature.I would like to say, Madam President, that, in the agreement to which we reached September, this debate differs from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative program.I would add, Madam President, that, on the side of the Commission, we are ready and willing to organize this debate when that suits you, that we were ready to develop it this week, as had been decided at the start, based on the fact that he was presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.I would therefore like to repeat, Madam President, that, for our part, we have discussed the action program for the next five years and that we are ready to come and present the program for the next five years when Parliament will decide, including this week, if this is its decision and the program for the year 2000, next month, which we had perfectly agreed.I propose that we voted on the request of the socialist group aimed at re -registering the declaration of the Commission on its strategic objectives.(Parliament rejects the request) The president.Always about Wednesday day, I have another proposal concerning the oral question on capital tax.The PPEDE group requests to withdraw this point from the agenda.Is there a colleague to speak on behalf of the group and justify this request?Madam President, to respond to the laughter that I hear among the socialists, I was told that large sides of the socialist group would also like to suppress this point of the agenda because during the ballot within the Conference of Presidents, colleagues responsible for the Socialist Group did not have the vote of the working group.I do not know if this information is correct but in any case, the PPE-DE group would be grateful to delete this point of the agenda because the parliament has indeed been seized of this question.Decisions exist that oppose such a tax.This is why my group asks that this point be removed from the agenda.Thank you, Mr. Poettering.We now hear Mr. Wurtz, who is expressed against this request.Madam President, I would first like to underline the lack of logic of Mr. Poettering.	fr
"But I would like to insist on tomorrow the other planned votes, in particular the vote for the Lisbon Summit. With this condition we have no objection to postponement.. The competent services inform me that tomorrow's list of votes is rather long. Mr President, like Mr Lannoye, I also faced my report on the second reading at 12 noon yesterday afternoon. The teams urged me to ask you for the vote not to take place at 12.00, but tomorrow, because they were unable to request detailed and capital votes. I still saw the vote for 12.00 to my great surprise. And on my part and on behalf of many other colleagues, I ask the vote to take place tomorrow.. Mr Blokland, I am learning from the competent services that the vote for your report is already scheduled for tomorrow. I now ask the body if it agrees to postpone the vote on the Lannoye report tomorrow. If we agree, the vote will be arranged for tomorrow. Annual Legislative Program (continued). The agenda subsequently provides for the debate on the European Commission's annual legislative program for 2000. We have already exposed to our discussion of the five -year program that this year will mark the beginning of the ""decade of Europe"" and will therefore be a year of change for the Commission. The analysis of the five -year program has given us the General Framework of Reference and we have already presented the five -year committee program. It should be noted that, just a month after this discussion we have already begun to take specific actions and we have launched the long process of enlargement to the countries that have submitted a successive application for accession. It is a very ambitious, large range and very important work, and I would like to reiterate before the European Parliament that the Commission was particularly committed to this project. It has also been confirmed by many as a statement to a very high commitment to the expansion, but also of serious commitment to which the Commission wants to remain faithful in order to reassure our states' public opinion on this venture. I would like to reiterate all that this is a serious and formal commitment, the aim of which is not to postpone the enlargement rather than to implement it in a realistic, meaningful and serious way. Otherwise, it will indeed arrive at a time when enlargement itself will become impossible. On the contrary, this is the fundamental commitment to the five -year term of office of this committee. We began to implement the five -year program for the other two points we had committed: the modernization of the committee and the preparation of the Intergovernmental Conference. Today the debate is shaped differently and is more detailed, and the reviews I received in the previous discussion, which was only generally, were correct, as it was the five -year program."	el
Here I immediately reacted to another widespread misunderstanding. It is not true that the fundamental rights book should only include the rights in which the European Union is the first appropriate and competent entity to which will be turned to. Also, in the event that the Union has no jurisdiction, political measures can violate the fundamental rights that the European Union will take or are taken in the name of it. Fundamental rights that cannot be guaranteed at the level of the European Union, but which the Union can violate. Then a note on international agreements on social fundamental rights. The statement of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee mentions some of them: the European Social Charter of the Council of Europe and ILO and UN Conventions. In the review of Duff and Voggenhuber reports, 22 I demand a reference to Article 6 of the European Convention on the European Council of Europe Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Basic Freedies, as well as references to the social book, and to the key conventions of ILO and the United Nations. The second review, ie 23, which concerns a longer option, states that the Council of Europe Convention to protect human rights and fundamental freedoms should be associated with, as well as these international social standards. Lastly, I would like to make a note that it is necessary to have a broad social foundation and that there is a dialogue with social organizations even after the fundamental rights book has been confirmed. Even then, we have to have a widespread debate.- (FR) Mr President, I want to congratulate all the presenters and the preparators of the statements about the versatility of their work. They have been able to highlight how important this topic is for Parliament, Europe and its citizens. The purpose of this report is to give our colleagues, members of the Charter of the Charter, a clear and accurate assignment in accordance with the expectations of the European Parliament, and to convey to our countrymen a strong indication of our commitment to the fact that the Union's institutions really respect their fundamental rights. The field of jurisdiction of the Petition Committee provides the basis for the commitment of the Committee on the preparation of a fundamental rights book. The numerous petitions arriving to the committee allows the view that citizens have on the Union and the rights they want the Union to protect. The aim of the Petition Committee's opinion is to highlight the wishes expressed by Europeans, which give Parliament to the issues where the right of the European Union is not respected. Pettractors who turn to us show the persistent and undeclared conviction that they have a number of rights and thus give the impression that European citizens are convinced that there is already a regulation guaranteed by European fundamental rights, in which all these rights have been stored in this sense. Thus, our statement emphasizes two essential aspects of which the presenters seem to agree. First of all, we emphasize the necessity of the visibility of the Citizens' Reference Text. This fact requires a clear and accurate wording of the Charter and listing rights in one and understandable text. Secondly, we emphasize the binding nature of this fundamental rights book, which is manifested as the true legal binding nature of recognized rights. The natural consequence of this will is to include the future fundamental rights book in the text of the Treaties. I say in summary that it is necessary to take a qualitative leap forward in protecting fundamental rights. This report must be a unanimous message of the Parliament in order for the Council and the Board of Fundamental Rights to meet this expectation of the petitioners. The Mr President, of course, would like to hear the opinion of political groups, which I think is a pretty good thing. Mr President, I would like to say that this is the best time to have this discussion. The preparatory committee drawing up the Charter has started its work, and I think we are working at a tremendous pace. First, we deal with civilian rights and political rights, then deal with citizens' rights and economic and social rights.	fi
So as for Andalusia, if it suits you, I hurry to deliver them to you as soon as I get this sub and regional information. Mr. Commission member, the problem is that when Aznar comes to the European Union to raise money for every Andalusian, he counts them all, but when Aznar pays for the services of the Andalusian Autonomous Government, he omits 400,000 children, and is very serious because 400,000 children are as muchThis question is very important, and since one can talk about a scam in the children, I would like to know if a member of the Commission shall be monitoring that these funds are not exported from the Andalusians and that the European Union pays to the Andalus of the European Union on the basis of the census criterion, the 400,000 children who are not included in schools and services. Good member, I would ask you everyone - don't keep this as a warning - that we deal solely on the community. I know these things are very important in Spain and there are different views ... I say to a member of the Commission that Aznar is the Spanish Prime Minister. You can answer the question. A good member of the Parliament because I heard that you have a voice, I hope your voice is strong enough to belong to Madrid, but I realized that your speech was not meant directly to me. I gave you my answer. I make sure that the funds in accordance with the Structural Funds, and in particular the assets of target 1, are granted to the areas that are in need of them. The funds are granted in accordance with the existing criteria, and we know here about how much the Union's area should receive or be able to obtain. In any case, I have to discuss with every Member State's national authorities and government I do not hide behind the general regulation, but it is always my responsibility to refer to it. It is the responsibility of the Member States to distribute the funds as impartially and as fair as possible. However, I have to get information about it and therefore I told you I can't answer today. Since I had no answer, I wrote to the Minister of Finance and Finance on December 14. That's all, and at some point I lose my patience if I have not received an answer, but I will pass the answer to you as soon as I get it. I apologize for the fact that a member of the Commission has once again given us an imaginative and, in this case, a fierce speech. The electoral season in Spain has not yet begun - I want to remind you all - but there is 25 days for the elections. It is comforting for a member of the Commission that the elections will be held in 25 days, when he or she will probably no longer ask such questions. It is important to say that it is important to say that Andalus will get 50 % more in the community frame and that Spain also holds a record of the structural funds, which means that the division is purely on implementing regulations and that funding is decentralized through regional development plans and various community support frames. Finally, I would like to ask a member of the Commission: Do you think the need for the Implementation of Structural Funds is necessary to change or do you consider the current distribution criteria to be acceptable?.(Fr) I find this debate fascinating. I well understand that it does not only apply to the community. After saying this, I add that one has to get used to the idea that all Member States of the Union have constant elections. In fact, it is the pleasure of the fact that the Structural Funds are discussed in Greece or Spain. We talked about civic or public debate a moment ago. The more we talk about the Union and what the Union does for our everyday life, the more valuable this debate is, as long as it is relevant.	fi
"We need a new kind of qualification knowing that using technology is not a quiet guarantee of a quality workplace. We need the increasing participation and responsibility of the social parties, the new actors under the report of the surface, to provide contracts on employment and competitiveness of companies. We need to solve the poverty problem and need a social model that suits new conditions. Mr President of the Council, your answer is quite daring, though we know that it does not depend on you but from 15 Member States. I would comment on the issue of Austria by hoping that this country could be one of the states that allow this proposal to be implemented. But if Austria does it, it cheats and lies to some of the electoralists in its government. I hope it could do so! Mr President of the Council, the Mr President of the Commission, our citizens often hear whether or not the grounding or conclusions are that we live in a globalized world. Instead, we rarely hear what a role in Europe must play in this society of knowledge, globalization and technology. Mr President, reminded me that this is probably because we Europeans may have the idea that Europe is sometimes quite far away from the most important things that are worried and interesting. Employment is probably the most important concern for European citizens. And employment is linked to competitiveness. For the sake of all this, we need to define Europe's role in the world economy, the role of competitive Europe, and I just emphasize the ""competitive"", enabling new, better and higher quality jobs precisely because we can guarantee social cohesion. Social risks, violation of society, unemployment, social exclusion and social security system imbalance are inevitable challenges created by globality, technological changes and the aging of the population. It is therefore necessary to create the conditions for full employment that fits into the society that we all build. This requires the dynamics of growth that guarantees an average annual growth of at least 3 % to the European Union. Thus, I find it necessary to promote a culture of dynamic and entrepreneurship and a culture that enhances social cohesion. All of this is absolutely essential: technological changes and institutional reforms. It is necessary to learn good practices faster and also create new appropriate practices and renew political methods. Of course, Europe currently has designed institutional processes that can develop these policies and create an economy and, above all, a society based on innovation and knowledge, adopting a European policy on information society and a society of knowledge and society, building a European education society and creating the world-oriented European science and technology. Mr President, I decide by saying that we must guarantee a combination of policies that favor growth and employment, ensure macroeconomic stability and strengthen the euro;which promote growth and transition to the society and economy of innovation, knowledge and skills. With structural policies and reforms, serving citizens, we make even more intimate and, of course, stronger Europe. Mr President, I would like to agree with all these thanks for the Presidential State Portugal's goals in this extraordinary meeting. In particular, the effort to bring about the actual coordination of social and economic policy in its full extent is very appealing to me. I would like to ask you to pay attention to three special things. The first thing is common leadership. Portugal, Presidency, has taken a very clear social dimension to the agenda, but I think this dimension is still too far from trying to encourage new activities. In my opinion, the social dimension also needs to be obtained for new European companies, whether they are large multinational companies or small companies in the field of data processing and telecommunications. I would like to reopen a debate on joint leadership, to discuss the broader concept of the company as an investor community and to be involved in the role of the social partners and all parties."	fi
Already at that time, the European Parliament condemned such activities by President Fujimor. In a way, President Fujimori has clearly been restored to Peru's peace of mind, but he has still followed the authoritarian line. In fact, I would say that President Fujimori is, for many, only as a civilian to a military power that is used indirectly. It is true that Peru still organizes elections that there are political parties in the country, that there are media media and that certain guarantees of democracy also exist. However, it is not entirely certain guarantees. This is evidenced by the fact that three Constitutional Court judges who had opposed him were separated in the re -election of Fujimor. In other words, there are no completely sure guarantees. The jurisdiction or legislative power is not independent. Secondly, Peru has recently withdrew from the binding jurisdiction of the American continents, and I think this gives the country a very bad stamp. I think we should ask the Peruvian government to reconsider this decision. Thirdly, Peru still has military activities, which often complicate the realization of democracy. It should be remembered that Peru is linked to the European Union as a party to the Andes group through a democracy clause, and with the European Community, more specifically, the Community's institutions are obliged to request that the Peru Election Process in accordance with the most important democracy requirements as possible. Mr President, a member of the Greens/European Free Alliance group, and since I represent a Basque Country in this Parliament, which has changed a relatively large number of immigrants to Latin America, I want to express my solidarity to all those who fight for human rights, both in Peru and all over the world. I also want to make a revelation of Peru's situation, not only because the United States accepts its eyes, as said here, but also that many other countries, including Europeans, do, do so, and also to the hypocrisy that prevails on the stage of international politics. It is also well known that the Carter Foundation (Fundación Carter) report that it is necessary to arrange access to the media as soon as possible, to stop their biased, to stop harassment of local election candidates and monitoring, warns of unauthorized use of public funds to support electoral work, increase the openness of the election administration, ensure the possibility of all parties. Thus, as already said here, I consider the creation of a human rights monitoring to Latin America absolutely important. The Mr President, our primary duty in the struggle to protect the civilian population, refugees and prisoners of war, is to do our best to finally end the war in Tsetsenia. This should also be the primary endeavor to the delegation of this Parliament, which will travel to the crisis area next week. Only the political resolution of all issues related to conflict and the reconstruction of the area ensures that the shocking situation of people in destroyed cities and villages, refugee camps and prison camps will change. On the other hand, I would also like to warn about Russia's unilateral condemnation and the accusations against it. As proves, among other things, the statement of the Council of Europe's observant delegation, all parties to the war have committed human rights abuses and war crimes. These crimes must be investigated and those responsible for them must be consistently liable for their actions. However, we should also give the competent Russian bodies the opportunity to do this work ourselves. Mr President, we had a welcome guest in the Parliament yesterday from the Ivy Parliamentary Assembly. This gave us a unique opportunity to discuss the war between Russia and Tsetsenia with other parliamentarians. These visitors appealed to us so that we realized that Russia fought against terrorism and did not go to the right war and that this war against terrorism has been exacerbated by the current of external weapons and the prey -sponsored training camps of Russian power. We responded. Russia is a member of the Council of Europe and does not need to protect its citizens internally from external attack from its international agreements.	fi
"That is why, in the committee, there is now a change application from me to the change application 2, which includes the waiver of the term ""harmonization"".This happens in the knowledge that the council meets us a bit, we can then accommodate the council, because this directive, I think, is a reasonable step forward.Nevertheless, and the advice must know that, of course, it makes sense that the Member States in the council have to coordinate about such controls and threatened sanctions sooner or later, because it would be nonsense if z.B. in Finland almost a prison sentence on violations and only a small fine in a southern country, or vice versa.That makes no sense.That is also not European.Therefore, I would like to say again about the procedure: The application application 3 replaces the amendment tailored to the committee 2. So it would have to be voted on tomorrow.If this were told to the Presidium, which will head the vote tomorrow, I would be very grateful.Then we would not have a process problem.So coordinate the change application 3 first.The change application 2 would then replace.So it is discussed in the committee, and then we could have this regulation very quickly and do not strive for an elaborate mediation procedure for a basically sensible solution.President!Everything is said.Allow me to build a bridge to the Vice President so that you may support the change application 3, which replaces 2.There are sometimes MPs in the room who say: it makes sense to standardize the traffic controls in their rigor, in their density.But when it comes to the word harmonization of the sanctions, some flinch in this room - left and right, top and bottom in this house.That is why I find this application No. 3, which Mr. Piecyk formulated as a rapporteur, wonderful.He completely avoided the word harmonization.But he said what it was about.He said that it cannot be that the benefit of a commercial vehicle, a bus with passengers without compliance with the safety regulations - which leads to the endangerment of life and life of humans - is considered in a country as a cavalier offense and is seriously punished in another country.In view of the risk of passengers or the other road users, this would be necessary.Therefore, this is not the question: Are we for subsidiarity or are we for centrality?The point is that it is not concerned that we have the common goal of traffic safety, but some governments say: well, from the punishments we consider violations of traffic safety such as violations of the ban on entering any green areas, and the others weight it correctly.First principle, vice president: the same assessment of the need to improve traffic safety.The second argument is that there must be no distortion of competition in the community.There are examples that the trucks of another Member State in a country are particularly keen to control, be held, held, etc., and in another country it doesn't matter.That is the core of the difference between parliament and a common point of view: We already believe that the Member States should try to vote in connection with the sanctions that remain in their national jurisdiction: How do I rate the risk of traffic, and how do I make the equality of competition within the community in an internal market?"	de
I would like to approach a point of great importance concerning the impact on businesses, raised by Mmes Thyssen, Peijs and Palacio Vallelersundi: these are SMEs.Many speakers have pointed out.The Commission pays particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.We propose a system that considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.For what ?Is it just a political gesture?No.In this system, we propose to reform our important rules in such a way that most SMEs are covered by regulations in terms of exemption by categories, as in the field of vertical restrictions.Most SMEs have less than 30 % market share.We have a minimis notice containing the following declaration: Since SMEs are not involved in market domination, they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition contained in article 81, paragraph 1. We are in the process of developing exemptions by categories and additional guidelines which will take all accounts of the particular situation of SMEs.In addition, our white paper on modernization will also improve the situation of SMEs, first of all by the elimination of the bureaucracy resulting from the current notification system and secondly, by making article 81, paragraph 3, directly applicable, which will benefit in particular SMEs.(IT) Fourth, legal certainty.Admittedly, Mr. Evans, legal certainty is - I am the first to recognize it - essential for companies and not only for legal professions which however play a very important role in favor of European construction.Legal certainty is essential for businesses, this is one of the subjects including the president of the Legal Commission and the Internal Market, Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi - that I thank for her way of following the issues related to the single market in the broad sense and therefore, in this case, competition too - also underlined the importance in her latest intervention.I am convinced that this proposal will increase the legal security of companies, for three reasons: it will allow, without prior decision, under the direct effect of article 81, paragraph 3, all restrictive competition agreements satisfying the conditions of exemption;It will assist companies in case of doubt in terms of interpretation through the publication of motivated opinions;It will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines aimed at clarifying the rules and ensuring its certainty.Ms. Thyssen also referred to the question of legal privilege for business lawyers.Allow me only to recall that the Court of Justice decided this question, as you know better than me, in 1982. This jurisprudence remains valid and nothing justifies that it is questioned.The white paper imposes a review of the question for only one of its aspects: the exchange of confidential information.The guarantees that must be given to companies are currently the subject of discussions.(IT) I come now, Mr. President, quickly to Mr. Rapkay's report, whom I warmly thank for the quality of his work and for the support given overall to the XXVIIIth annual report of the Commission on the Competition Policy.	fr
I believe that the political message of this parliament should consist of something more original than by a recasting of neoclassical economic incomprehensible reasons. Something more vigorous than an invitation to tradition in the calamities of the market economy, something more decent than the reaction to the conscientious goals, but it denies them the means for their implementation. The report that has reached your hands from the Committee on Economic and Monetary Policy has problems with all these aspects. If it is not restored in its original form by parliament by accepting the amendments submitted by the European Socialist Party team, I must act unusually, but inevitably, and ask my fellow socialists, and even from anyone who believes thatabout thinking nor in consciousness. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the passion and beliefs of our colleague George Katoforis prevented him from doing what is normal in a presentation by a rapporteur, that is, to support the report submitted to plenary. He didn't. He supported his position, but he was not the one approved by the committee. We have clearly different views. One of them is that we believe that we can see the evolution of the European economy with confidence. Yesterday, Commissioner Solbes, in a speech to the Economic Policy Committee, pointed out to us that precisely the prospects of the European economy for the current and next year are excellent. Even more, some states have been mentioned whose problem is what they will do with their fiscal surplus. The problems that arise are, for example, the choice between tax cuts or a reduction in financial deficit, apparently avoiding prices, or - to understand - of the creation of a special reserve, in order to deal with any cases where social assistance may be necessary, given the European Union. We tend to consider that there is a steady basis for this economic growth of the Union, now and in the coming years, and that we must bear in mind that we are in an open, globalized and very competitive economy. If we are to reach the level of primacy of the United States, and even overcome it, what we need to do is to avoid the interventionism initially proposed by Mr Katiphus, to avoid excessive intervention by the public authorities in building some infrastructure. On the other hand, the Member States refused to offer more resources when we were discussing the agenda of 2000, so, at the level of the European Union, in the coming years, few can have at our disposal. On the contrary, we really insist on the need to continue deepening the building of the European internal market, which still has significant gaps. There are still areas, such as air transport, energy, telecommunications, where, if we compare the unit costs in relation to the United States or other countries equally competitive internationally, it is deduced that the costs of our businesses is still very high. This report includes an element that, in order to create a new business, the bureaucratic cost in the United States is 500 euros and in the European Union, on average, is 1600.	el
"As is well known, the European Commission should have submitted new proposals to change the directive 97/67 via postal services by the end of 1998, while maintaining the universal services and securing their economic viability, with a regulation for the gradual liberalization of the market for postal services as well as taking into account the consequences for those affected, including employees and customers.For this purpose, the Commission has commissioned studies on the costs of universal services, the effects of liberalization in cross-border postal traffic and the advertising disputes, the consequences of reducing weight and price boundaries in the exclusive range as well as the effects of the subsequent phases of the liberalization of the handling of mailings except for delivery.In addition, an overall assessment of the results of the studies should be carried out.We ask ourselves and of course the Commissioner - Mr. Bolkestein is not present, but Mr. Monti can certainly say something about his wide -ranging competence: Shouldn't the economic and social effects of the various scenarios intended for liberalization be examined on each, I repeat every member country of the European Union?The postal services look very different in Greece than in the UK, in the Netherlands very different from Belgium.How should after the liberalization of the universal post service in a country such asB. my country, namely Greece, are appropriately financed and organized, the geographical peculiarity of which is that it has many small but inhabited islands?How should an operator survive in my country who is obliged to offer universal services if the cross -border postal service is liberalized, even though this proportion is below 5 % in other countries?How should the national postal service be relocated abroad?You heard what Mr. McCartin just said about it.Since this is most likely to be decided gradually and controlled liberalization while setting the weight and price ranges, due to the technical developments that make this shift easier and thus more profitable, more profitable.But what should they look like?Will you be as naive and, like the ""Freuzützen"", will allow themselves to choose the most lucrative parts and to avoid the weight limits without any problems, since the content of the programs cannot be checked anyway?In any case, we ask the Commission to disclose the cards and present their proposals, whereby the intended overall development of this matter must be examined from all sides and for all Member States.Of course, liberalization is not an end in itself, but only a means of improving the services.Mr. President, revered Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!The prospect of liberalization of the classic national postal services inevitably raises the question of what the postal services consider in the future as their core business, in other words, what the postal services themselves, what they will no longer do in the international network and what they will no longer do.Against the background of the fact, this question must be answered that the sole monopoly is de facto through various courier services and technological developments such as fax and email.On the other hand, the focus is on the liberalization of postal services."	de
By attributing a de facto preference to products from establishments in occupied territories during the period of validity of these trade agreements, the EU violates two essential principles of international law: on the one hand the rules relating to the unilateral integration of occupied territories, and on the other hand the fourth Geneva Convention in 1949. Respect by the EU and the whole world of these two international principles being at the base of the peace process,Such offenses have the effect of undermining the foundations of the peace process itself.The EU must now choose between the desire to establish its relations with Israel and Palestine on the standards of international law, and thus strengthen the peace process, or do no case of international law.The choice should be simple.International law prescribes us not to set up commercial relations only with the countries and regions it recognizes, and not with territories whose membership is disputed.EU member states and Israel must comply with the rules contained in the trade agreement on the strict control of the origin of the products, and customs duties must be returned.He returns to the commission to watch.The intervention of Commissioner Vitorino gives us some hopes in this direction.You have to give a chance to the peace process in the Middle East.And this chance can only be based on international law.The EU is responsible for contributing to it.Mr. President, Messrs deputies, I would first like to thank all the deputies who made a rich and precious contribution to this debate when a question of great political sensitivity was addressed.If the Commission can afford to teach this debate, I would say that, we could conclude that, in broad outline, the Parliament is due to a strategy certainly prudent, but clear, which the Commission will also adopt to deal with this issue.The Commission does not ignore the political sensitivity of this theme and no doubts at any time because the progress aimed at finding concrete solutions for a concrete application of this trade agreement is closely linked to the evolution of the peace process in the Middle East.In fact, the political importance given to the peace process by the European Union finds an echo in Parliament and to the Commission, as pointed out by several deputies, and this interest results from the recent visit in this region of Madam President Nicole Fontaine, as well as Mr. President Romano Prodi last week.This is why we are well aware of being living a particularly delicate moment in the peace process, which should not be disturbed by positions that would result from a blind application of legal rules, since the application of the law requires that one is trying to find an acceptable solution for all parties.And in truth, the Commission adopted in this area a position aimed at obtaining the support and convergence of all the parties involved in this peace process.	fr
I would like to emphasize Mr. Schulz that we do not bring the amendments to the change as a person or out of personal considerations, but always in the context of a general political interest.If we wanted to set up a list of those who are investigated or wanted to search for such people, we could also find them among the rapporteurs, including the author's author.I therefore think Mr. Schulz could have saved his deliberate comments.As I said, numerous changes have been incorporated, which have the right to defend - I think of the obligation to apply by the investigative judge - or the fact that the common investigative groups must not belong to any civil servants who are also active as a judge.In principle, according to the will of the parliament, the convention should only apply to criminal law;The circumcision of fundamental rights and freedoms provided for in the Convention must therefore inevitably be limited to criminal law.We need safe rules.It is true, of course, that the council did not proceed uniformly, that it has changed his opinion during the procedure and is not present today.On the other hand, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for being present here in the hall during the debate.So we need safe rules so that fair processes are conducted in the Union - without flooding through surveillance measures, without illegal use of video conferences;So that the Union never gets back to processes in which the judges instead of speaking right;So that the real culprits are punished and not innocent people who are uncomfortable to anyone.President!The draft of the Convention on Legal Aid in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is about to accept his acceptance by the Council.Most say it is time for it.After the action plan to combat organized crime, which was accepted by the Council in April 1997, work on the draft of the MLA Convention should be completed before the end of 1997.However, further time will pass before it will actually come into force in view of the fact that the ratification by the Member States is necessary.Even according to the new rules of the Amsterdam contract, which provide an entry into force, if at least half of the Member States have accepted the Convention, I would like to ask the Member States to do everything in their power in order to ratify this agreement as quickly as possible.Unfortunately, the experiences of the past in relation to the ratification of the European Union Convention in the area of ​​Justitial Cooperation in Criminal Matters are disappointing.With this Convention, no new or other system of legal assistance should be created.Rather, it aims to build on proven mechanisms that have been around for a very long time and how they provide for the European legal assistance agreement of 1959 and the Benelux contract.The draft created by the Council contains provisions on a variety of things that have been discussed by various MPs.It is a remarkable achievement of the Convention that the requested Member States, where possible, have to stick to the formalities and procedures, refer to which the requesting Member State refers.This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using judicial evidence.	de
We still cannot continue to let destroy all our possibilities for action on the political level.Revenues from non -economic activities still cannot continue to increase ever more quickly.Since Tobin developed his idea, it turned out that in Germany, financial capital income has gone from 7.6 % of all income to almost double today.We cannot continue to see the poorest countries of this planet be hardest confronted with speculation that affects monetary fluctuations in the short term.I don't think it is unfeasible more.Why would it not be possible to identify an agreement between the states of the G7, the other states of the EU, China, Singapore and Switzerland on the introduction of the Tobin tax?There should be common economic interest.Why could we not achieve - differentiation can be made - to subject this tax to transactions aimed at the immediate exchange of currencies, the whole of what are called cash, long -term and optional operations on currencies?Why could we not fix the amount of this tax so as not to threaten long-term investments, essential on the economic level, but to finally make short-term investments and speculative investments?Many difficult questions will certainly ask themselves but the only important problem that I perceive is the political will and this principle of Sankt-Florian, also applicable today, which consists in repelling responsibility from one place to another.Madam President, as Mr. Karas said a few minutes ago, we do not ask for an additional bureaucracy.We are looking for solutions.There is no doubt that it is more clear on the capital markets: this is the idea.The Tobin tax will put some transparency in this very obscure question.The more we progress towards the liberalization of exchanges, the more rules we need.This is what Commissioner Lamy said at the opening of the Millennium Cycle in Seattle.He recognized that the combined effect of the single market and the single currency which characterize the process of construction of the European Union is intimately linked to a enormous volume of new regulations.Now that capital can immediately cross national borders without any difficulty, it is obvious that the same approach will be strictly necessary, especially since the amounts daily engaged in speculative transactions are enormous.We, citizens of the world, cannot accept the current level of speculation.Continue would be economic suicide.My dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, we often hear that Europe has managed to ensure financial stability, which is true if we stick to the public sector.But if we include the private sector, we see that this famous Financial Stability, not only has not been obtained, but that we are probably sitting on a volcano ready to explode at any time.Over -indebtedness of the private sector and the excessive surge in the equity prices that corresponds to it - the two major clues of financial market stability - have long been in red, as the commission's own report on Europe's economic situation demonstrates it in a way that does not ready to any dispute.	fr
In our opinion, a factor will influence the role of the Commission in the near future, which has to do with a certain revival of the European political initiative on the part of the governments of the Member States due to the failure of the Commission Santer.We consider this to be a very positive aspect, since the national parliaments, on which the governments depend on, can continue to penetrate the indispensability of their democratic mandate when building Europe.It is a fact that the European Parliament still does not gain the trust or even the interest of national public opinion, where one stubbornly refuses to think European, as the high proportion of non -voters to be determined in the last elections.So it is about strengthening the mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States by making them more coherent, more transparent and democratic.We welcome Romano Prodi's efforts to improve the Commission's public appearance and the need that it must communicate with the European Parliament and the Council.However, we are of the opinion that in the foreground the reform of the mechanisms of intergovernmental cooperation, in particular through the creation of a Council of Ministers for Europe, its members with each other and in coordination with the other European organs, assuming responsibility to ensure that the political decisions of the European councils result in concrete actions.Report Corrie (A5-0032/2000) Mrs. President!The work of the parity assembly in 1999 was characterized by the growing concern of the continued existence of the cooperation model resulting from the Lomé Agreement.As early as 1994, the parity assembly made itself in a first resolution in which our colleague Dominique Souchet played a significant part, worried about the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay round, which had rejected the basic principle of the common community preferential for this cooperation.The cherished fears have been confirmed for two years.The most clear example of this is the banana dispute.Despite their unstable economies, the developing countries should adapt to the liberalization of trade.In the report by Mr. Corrie, this situation is criticized and the adherence to the parity assembly at the Lomé model is affirmed, but a second problem, which is basically also based on erroneous free trade policy, namely the incoherency of the regional trade agreements concluded by the European Union, is not sufficiently emphasized.The best example is the cooperation agreement with South Africa.The Council approved this agreement negotiated by the Commission, although the agricultural chapter, which was nevertheless, has not yet been finally regulated.As our colleague Paul-Marie Coûteaux aptly noticed in his yesterday's statements and in his amendments, one has to ask yourself what political logic may correspond to such a blank check.We are very concerned about it, all the more than a similar agreement with Mexico.The rapporteur's claim after integration of the European development fund into the budget of the community is also not acceptable.We would like to protect the clear obligation and responsibility of each Member State, as the intergovernmental character enables.Unfortunately, we have experienced too many examples in which the common help for which nobody feels responsible, we have been misused, and we want to avoid such a catastrophic system at the EEF.	de
"(The parliament accepts the motion for decision-making.) Report (A5-0078/1999) by Mr. Rapkay on behalf of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Currency on XXVIII.Commission's report on the 1998 competition policy (SEK (1999) - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124 (COS)) (Parliament accepts the motion for resolution.) Report (A5-0087/999) by Mr. Jonckheer on behalf of the Committee on Economics and currency on the seventh report of the Seventh Aid in the European AidTrade and in some other sectors (KOM (1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110 (COS)) (Parliament accepts the motion for resolution.) Report (A5-0073/999) by Mr. Langen on behalf of the Committee on the Committee on the application of the Commission on the application of its decision No. 2496/96/EGKS of December 18, 1996Regulations on aid to the iron and steel industry (steel aid code) in 1998 (KOM (1999) 94- C5-0104/1999/2107 (COS)) (the parliament accepts the motion for resolution.)(FR) As is well known, the European Union is financed from four sources of income.The European budget is fed from VAT and the bip compartment, especially since with the loss of the community preference and the increase in the free trade zones, customs fees and the community agricultural creation have been eliminated after they had previously been cut by the APS.Since then, the volume and justice of the community own funds have been impaired to a considerable extent in a considerable extent by VAT frauds and distortions when calculating the bip as a tax base for the fourth resource.Therefore, with its federal pretentions, the Europe is financed more than ever like a banal intergovernmental organization, which it is, but does not want to be.This becomes very clear from the prescription present to us.One worries about the ""booking of your own funds"" to your ""provision"" or the ""control"" of the amounts provided to the Commission.In addition, the newly created advisory committee consists of representatives of the member states subject to contributions.You are far from the excesses, such as the ""Community Criminal Law"", the ""Community General Prosecutor's Office"" or to the Community Police with the Olaf.There is still no European federal tax here.However, the Europe will request the 25 according to a European income tax, unless you prefer a profit tax, or the 2025 budget is financed from CO2 taxation.Report Koch (A5-0105/1999).(FR) I am very pleased with this report on better harmonization in the training of security advisors for transport dangerous goods.The national and international dangerous goods transport have increased considerably over the past few years, which has increased the risk of accidents.In many cases, the accidents were due to the insufficient knowledge of the risks associated with these transports.So it proved to be necessary to take measures for better risk prevention as part of the creation of the internal market.Directive 96/35/EC corresponded to this requirement.The companies whose activity comprises the transportation of dangerous goods or the loading or unloading associated with this transport were rightly imposed on risk prevention, which apply to the transportation on the road, rail or inland waterways.In order to facilitate the implementation of this goal, Directive 96/35/EC stipulated the establishment of appropriately trained security consultants for the dangerous goods transport."	de
Compared to this latter initiative, only 6 years, the budget available for Leader +, 7 years, is reduced by 50%. This is unacceptable given the importance of rural development and the consequences of farmers to reduce prices and aid, as provided for in the reform of the CAP under the Berlin agreements. Finally, among the priority parameters imported on a European scale to allow local bodies to be involved, special attention should be paid to the quality and innovative character of the plans already drawn up by the LOAD in the LEADER II initiative, but which were not able to be completed by the timetable.(The session discontinued at 13.40 continues at 15.00) Additional materials in the animal diet. The Daily provision provides for the discussion of the report (0015/2000) of Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, on behalf of the Committee on Agriculture and the Development of the Outdoor, on the proposal of the Council Directive on the amendment of Directive 70/524/EEC, which relates to the additional materials in the nutrition of animals (1999) 388 - C5-0134/1999 -1999/0168 (CNS)). Mr President, Mr Commissioner, I wonder if the directive on the added materials in animal nutrition is a matter of competition or consumer protection policy. For the European Commission and the Committee on Legal Affairs it is a matter for competition. It is certain that we need to promote the competitiveness of the animal feed industry by harmonizing the provisions on additional materials adopted before and after 1988. AD fractures must certainly be avoided, and amendments should therefore be accepted.4 and 5 by Mr. Doyle. However, it is primarily a matter of consumer protection policy, as Mr Graefe Zu Baringdorf said in his report. Food safety must be prioritized in all animal nutrition discussions. When we talk about transparency of the food chain, then it starts from the field and ends up on our plate, so consumer protection starts with feed. Added antibiotics, growth factors and genetically modified organisms (GMOs) eventually end up in the food chain of humans. We all understood from the scandal with dioxins that we must finally work properly. Adjustment for additives in feed is one step in the right direction. According to Article 152 of the Treaty for the Establishment of the European Community, we are obliged to delete the causes of risk for human health. Emphasis is clearly given to the causes. Consequently, we must exclude the primary sources of harmful substances, that is, the harmful added materials to the feed. Otherwise, in my view, we only face the symptoms without fighting the causes. People have a critical attitude, especially in relation to the use of genetically modified organisms. We need to deal with the increasing awareness of the population to the GMOs and regulate their use in feed. First, if an additional substance consists of GMOs or contains GMOs, it should only be approved if these organizations do not constitute a proven risk to human health and the environment. Secondly, it is perfectly reasonable that arrangements for genetically amended additives in feed should be established, in proportion to the arrangements provided by the seeds law, as the rapporteur also said. Thirdly, in the spirit of a transparent consumer protection policy, we need to mark genetically modified feed.	el
Mrs. President!In my double capacity as a member of the Grünen/Free European Alliance faction and as a member of the European Member of the Basque Nationalist Party, I would first like to express our decisive condemnation of the cowardly attack, the two people, which Ertzaina Jorge Díez Elorza and the Basque MPs and former Vice Eve of Fernando Buesa.Secondly, we express our condolences as well as our solidarity and compassion to this loss with all my heart with your family members, their socialist comrades, the Basque Parliament and the Basque autonomous police.Thirdly: We complain of the severity of an assassination, which not only ignores respect for dignity and human rights, but also disregarded the popular will by directed against a elected representative of the citizens.Fourthly: We express our disgust, because with this double murder the process of political normalization to achieve peace in the Basque Country is to be immediately destroyed.Fifth: We straighten up to the Spanish and French governing and politically responsible and ask them again to show the same proportion of proportion that was shown in the United Kingdom and in Ireland in order to be able to find a solution to the current Basque political conflict with others, which will not lead to each other alone.Sixth and most recently: We explain that terrorism and violence on the part of the ETA have to end and that it has to stop, the Basque citizens who have to decide freely and without violence about their future to take the will.Just three months ago, like many of my colleagues, I congratulated the Irish and British people in this plenary on their success to have found a solution to the Northern Ireland conflict.Too many people have been injured and murdered in Northern Ireland in the past thirty years - too many families have been destroyed.As far as the current conflict in the Basque Country is concerned, the opposite has happened in Spain and France.We from the Euskal Herritarrok are firmly convinced that the current struggle can only be ended through an open dialogue and transparent negotiations without a rigid agenda.In the nineteen months before January 20, there was only one murder in the Kingdom of Spain, namely the attack on ETA member Luis Geresta, who died in March 1999.Despite this attack and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, also by ETA members who were in negotiations with the Spanish government, the ETA kept its one-sided ceasefire.In November last year, before the end of the ceasefire, the spokesman for the Spanish government, Mr. Piqué, said that his government had so far done everything to do so and that everything will do everything that will be able to prevent current efforts to find a political solution for the Basque Country.We, the Euskal Herritarrok, have often had to regret the loss of human life.Together with the Basque population, we carry the suffering of our people.We are for a dialogue and we are ready to work with all those who are striving for a democratic solution for the Basque Country.Since the Northern Ireland question was addressed for the first time in this parliament, twenty years have passed.	de
"These issues are also mentioned in your resolution. It was precisely these issues that I discussed without spin with the Russian government during my visit to the region in early February. The Commission also reiterated this message to Foreign Minister Ivanov during the ministerial troika on March 2, when we submitted some specific proposals, including ECHO's evaluation missions to Chechnya, access to NGOs and some of their basic requests and their diplomas visits to the Diplomas. Citizens, the humanitarian situation, the complaints of human rights and the consequent investigations. We are still waiting for a response from the Russian authorities to these specific proposals. Regarding the media status in Serbia, escalating actions by the Serbian authorities against Studio B at the beginning of last week are completely unacceptable and we disapprove of them. The increasing pressure exerted on the independent media shows precisely the great importance of these media. The European Commission is making great efforts to boost independent media in Serbia. In December 1999, we approved a € 3.3 million support program. We have set out in reserve credits for emergency funding, which can provide equipment and funds for the survival of these media, including television stations such as Studio B. The Commission is putting new staff to implement plans for the media and our contracts with their beneficiaries.grants. Satellite equipment is also distributed throughout the area, Croatia, Bosnia - Herzegovina and Macedonia. The European Commission service ""Europe through a satellite"" continues its support by providing part of its operating time to Serbia's independent television stations in order to transmit information that will reach the rest of the region and encourage the exchange of programs. For Iraq I have to comment on the following: The Commission is anxious about Iraq's unilateral decision not to accept the United Nations Security Council resolution 1284, as well as the consequent delay in the operation of the new Unmovic Supervisory Media, as well as relaxing the regime. This will only result in the extension of the crisis in Iraq.""Oil Instead of Food"" remains the best short -term option, which will relieve the Iraqi people of their suffering. In the long run, the economic and social situation in Iraq can only be improved through increased economic activities and enhance it by lifting sanctions. Ways should be sought capable of committing the Iraqi government to a dialogue on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolutions, which may gradually lead to sanctions. But let's become clear - the key to lifting the sanctions is in the hands of Iraq. Since the Gulf War in 1991, the Commission is for Iraq the largest sponsor of humanitarian aid, with contributions exceeding 242m euros. An additional EUR 8.6 million was granted by the ECHO budget for 2000. However, the Commission is anxious about the restrictions imposed by the Iraqi government on NGO businesses, which may endanger the implementation of Echo's funded programs to provide humanitarian aid to Iraq. Finally, Mr President, in terms of the situation in the mosque or Kashmir, the Commission welcomes the European Parliament's deep concern over the Kashmir dispute, which is reflected in the various resolution plans."	el
"Secondly, the meeting will look more closely at what initiatives should be introduced to prevent social exclusion and to combat it in our society. Thirdly, leaders are presenting new programs to ensure that the European Union is a leader in all areas of changing and emerging information technology markets. The world is decreasing in the market and the term ""world village"" is not undue. However, globalization does not mean and may not include the absolute and free access of all existing products and services. It is clear that each country has different focus areas for what areas of economy it wants to protect. It was revealed in the Uruguayn round that ended the Gatt negotiations and will be reflected in the negotiations of the World Trade Organization over the next three years. From the point of view of the European Union, it is important that there is no longer any dealing in any way in the context of the upcoming MMP administration between 2000 and 2006, which our leaders signed last year in Berlin and supported by Parliament. In addition, initiatives that promote European cultural and linguistic diversity must continue to be supported. We are not allowed to build Europe for successful and interruptions. The European Union is a very strong economic factor, but there are still major social problems that need to be systematically addressed. We still need to implement comprehensive training programs for young people and long-term unemployed in both European and rural areas. The European Social Fund and the National Governments still need to finance drug rehabilitation programs for drug abuse, promotes better literacy for adults and preventing schooling. Mr President, a well -functioning labor market and a sustainable balance between demand and supply are the wishes of many. Therefore, it is understandable that highly high unemployment is an important point on the agenda of the Lisbon Summit. However, the question arises whether it is legitimate to raise employment policy in this way into a European policy. Despite satisfactory economic growth, the decline in unemployment has stopped. In some Member States where the economy is growing rapidly, the labor market has become hot and inflation is accelerating. In other Member State, growth is slow, unemployment rate high and prices are stable. Special means, such as interest rate and exchange rate, are no longer available. However, the differences in the business cycle during the business cycle require a Member State -specific measures. Does the Council also strive for this? If so, what measures do the Presidential State think? In the heated labor market, no one expects growth in labor -intensive sectors. However, is this taken into account in politics? Is it selective growth? Are you ready to grow in labor -intensive areas in areas with high unemployment rates? If the Lisbon Summit is seriously rejecting unemployment, then not only general measures are sought. The work should be moved to where the unemployment rate is the highest. It is dangerous to expect the unemployed to move to areas where there is work, especially if it is about moving across the border after work. This may result in worsening population in certain poorly developed areas. Mr President, we have not made it easier for us to make it easier for us when we introduce common money from Member State-specific monetary and economic policy to control the business cycle. I can imagine that the United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark will consider this once more before they go to the euro adventure. Therefore, at the Employment Summit, good and sustainable agreements should be concluded to combat unemployment so that the principle of subsidiarity is particularly taken into account, since the problems must be addressed above all in the Member States themselves. Mr President, I would like to warmly thank Prime Minister Guterres for his presentation and its clarity. In this context, I want to ask in particular what is really here. Of course, we currently have macroeconomic cooperation, the so -called Cologne process, and we have an employment process, the so -called Luxembourg process. What is new this summit is going to do in this area now? Of course, new is about social protection. It hasn't really been talked about at the summit level at all. I also think it is a very important topic to talk about."	fi
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament weakens a point of view of the council, while in general - I believe - we act the other way around.By a free return of the old vehicles e.g.B. and the increase in the recycling share would expand the corresponding economic activities and thus arise new jobs.In the interest of the consumer, the environment and the jobs that are newly created in the recycling industry, the common point of view of the council, which is completely acceptable in its current form, must not be changed.Mr President, like many of those present, I also consider this to be a good measure.It is a sensible measure that we all need.The technical problems were essentially clarified.Some individual questions still have to be clarified, but the majority of the technical problems are solved.We have reached the last question.In the debate on the first reading, this question was only asked by the committee for economy and currency and presented to the parliament as the author of the statement of this committee.It is very simple: who pays?In its common point of view, the council suggested a reasonable compromise that says that the manufacturers should bear a considerable part of the costs, but not all costs, as Mr. Bowis mistakenly stated.As the lawyers tell us, actually not more than 20 % or a fifth of the costs.That's probably not too much.For example, if you look at the British consumer who buys a Rover cited by Lange or any other car brand in the United Kingdom and has paid excessive prices for these cars for years, which are far above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should it pay?He already paid.Why should the same people pay as taxpayers or future car buyers for the disposal of vehicles where the manufacturer has earned?I can't accept that.Today we have some amendments that suggest that.I can't accept that, and I won't be right for that either.The manufacturer lies responsibility for these vehicles.The manufacturer must provide the corresponding infrastructure and bear a reasonable part of the disposal costs.The common point of view does not rule out the possibility of participation by the state.The common point of view is a reasonable compromise.Some of the amendments submitted today are completely unreasonable in that the automobile manufacturers of their responsibility for assuming a part of the costs for the disposal of motor vehicles.I cannot accept that, and I therefore vote against these amendments in the name of European taxpayers and consumers.Mr. President, my dear ladies and gentlemen!There is agreement that we have to worry about how we deal with old cars in Europe, but in this case the Council has not given an example of a sensible European environmental policy.It was embarrassing how the German Council Presidency dealt with this topic.First of all, Mr. Trittin, the Environment Minister, did not adequately coordinate with his colleagues in the cabinet, after which Chancellor Schröder interfered in this procedure like an elephant in the porcelain shop without expertise.	de
The possible coating of aid should be avoided, and synergistic results should be used at the same time. In this spirit, the aim of enhanced networking between Leader promotion areas must also be particularly applauded. Georgia is one of the pillars of the rural area, and it must also participate in the leader initiative, that is, the structural change in the agriculture may be accompanied by the leader initiative by creating new jobs in the agricultural area. The LEADER+ program must take into account all the economic functions of the rural area, and only through common efforts can the best result can be achieved through common efforts. Leader must now be implemented. Operational programs must be approved as soon as possible by the Commission, which implies the proper and effective management of the application process and the process of approving applications as soon as possible. There is a five -month period, which I find very big. Efforts would have to be made here to reduce time spaces. Because anyone who has developed and completed a program is also unleashed to start implementing it. Despite the pleasure of reforming this Community Leader+ initiative there is still something that concerns me: the EU Commission has demanded the establishment of a Leader+ monitoring service, without detailing the implementation of this proposal. This means that I wonder about the following issues: Who will work there? How will these people be selected? Where do they mainly come from the corresponding amounts of money, and where will the site of this monitoring installation be located? But I think the Leader+ program cannot even dispose of a penny for additional administrative content duties, which should be fulfilled by the Commission anyway. In addition, experiences in other areas where monitoring services were established show that they do not bring particular benefits other than a dubious nature creation. Therefore, I urge the Commission to take its control immediately and to support the positive course of LEADER+programs. This is of course the evaluation and publication, which, as is well known, has already happened so far. Mr President, most of the border, which for centuries have separated Europe, was artificially engraved, separating single geographical spaces and causing large variations in terms of balanced growth and cohesion. Our internal borders, or whatever remains of them, no longer cause wars, but continue to cause economic delay, social barriers and a lack of cultural communication between the peoples of Europe. In Community institutions, we are obliged to work in order to overcome these border wounds, which are contradictory to the spirit of European unity. The economic and social cohesion we propose takes a specific form through the Interreg initiative, with the territorial cohesion and the completion of the border areas and regions of our continent. Interreg has been since birth the seed of an authentic community policy on planning and a truly multicenter perception of European territory.	el
When it comes to contamination, we are all against as if it is a sin, but from this point until we come to believe that a measure is necessarily good, simply because it is proposed to combat this evil, there is a big difference. In fact, this directive, like so many other environmental issues, is not good. As is often the case, it simply provides another huge bureaucratic structure for controlling a problem, which will simply serve to create more jobs for permanent employees and costs the automotive and consumers a lot of money. All he will not succeed is to solve the problem - it is a huge heavy that does not even achieve a nut. No one, and even less my party, could disagree that recycling must be encouraged, but the best way to do so is to work with the market and not create another bureaucratic monstrous. Therefore, a more appropriate way to encourage recycling is to tax manufacturers who do not increase the rates of recoverable materials in vehicles they produce, to encourage private sector recycling companies through a beam of tax incentives and helping them to comply with the use of the investigators. Of course, these are areas in which the EU has no jurisdiction and should not have such jurisdiction. However, in the absence of such powers, it should not seek to replace them with a less effective measure. Instead, it must allow Member States to develop their own systems and avoid the tendency to intervene where it does not need and where it cannot benefit anything. Berger report (A5-0007/2000) The purpose of this Directive proposal is to determine the conditions for the secondment of third-party employees in the context of the provision of cross-border services. This is because third -country nationals who are legally residing in a Member State do not enjoy the right to free movement in the territory of the European Union, and to date the restrictions imposed on the free movement of extra -communal workers on the territory of the European Union have been particularly stringent. It is therefore positive that the free movement of workers in the European Union is facilitated, even if they are third -country nationals. However, the Directive proposal does not aim to allow these employees to move to another Member State only when they are detached on behalf of an employer who is established in the country where their usual place of residence is located, so the possibility of free traffic is limited to the posting period and in force. This means that the basic concern of this proposal is not to solve the problem of free movement of these workers, but simply to facilitate the work of the providers. On the other hand, on the pretext of simplifying procedures, some extremely controversial amendments are incorporated into the Berger report, such as e.g. The one that proposes the establishment of a common information exchange system and access to cards issued by any Member State. Berger report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger (A5-0012/2000) I welcome the two instructions with great satisfaction with the aim of facilitating the free movement of third-party nationals, while facilitating the free movement of services.	el
The Commission mainly welcomes the proposals of amendment 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, which relate to the processes of the committees. Parliament has taken into account, in these cases, the objections that the Commission had in the common position. The Commission may also first adopt the proposal of amendment 4, which, however, must be incorporated into another part of the text. Regarding amendment 5 and 6 proposals, I would like to emphasize that the Sustainable Sustainable Sustainable Program as well as the surface, as well as the program to reduce atmospheric pollutants that contribute to the greenhouse effect, are largely included in the LIFE program. However, the Commission believes that if this is determined separately, then it conflicts with the initial decision to focus the proposal in a few areas in which priority has been given. There is also the risk of coating with other Community programs, such as the fifth program for research, technical development and demonstration. The basic measures of this program, namely, water quality, the city of the future and innovative products and processes, include, to one point, the same issues. As far as the budget is concerned, I am glad to be the confidence shown by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. The amendment proposal 12 is requested that the budget is greater than the one referred to in the common position. And I am convinced that the Life program is very potential. This instrument could fund good programs with funds more than those mentioned in the proposed budget. However, the amount of funds referring to the amendment 12 proposal is irrelevant to the budget plan as determined on the basis of Agenda 2000. Let me add that it is self -evident if the budget is increased, then, the requirements from the General Directorate of the Environment to handle the increase in the number of programs. Other programs for which decisions will be taken in the context of the syndicate process must be taken into account. At this stage, the Commission adheres to the amount specified in the common position. Regarding the proposal of amendment 3, which we did not adopt at first reading, I would like to emphasize that each program has its own goals, its expenditure for which an amount is justified as financial support and application procedures. Therefore, it does not make sense and, often, it is impossible to transfer programs from the LIFE program to other financial instruments. After all, if we are investigating which different sources of funding exist for each program, then more resources would be required than those available today. Now that the Commission must carefully study which resources are required for each activity, this is an example of a non -essential, but but cost -effective activity that we must avoid. The Commission cannot also adopt the proposal of amendment 14, which clashes with the right to take the Commission's initiative. Regarding the debate on the final date, I would like to say that the final date for the launch of the LIFE program, that is, March 31 of 2000, which was set in the common position, must be transferred for later.	el
We can debate this a little later.But I note that reality corresponds exactly to what I say, namely that prices have lowered in the areas where competition reigns, when they have increased where the post office remained a monopoly.It almost always happens as well.This is why I ask today that the Commission takes the necessary initiatives and that it ensures that the competition really sets out in the postal sector.Mr. Markov, you will have a few minutes in five or six minutes.I will be grateful for not interrupting your colleagues.Mr. President, there is a mystery.What happened to the postal services directive that was adopted on December 15, 1997?Between this date and today, the silence of the commission has been deafening.I'm sorry that it is Commissioner Monti who is present today.I appreciate it very much.He is one of the most diligent and most workers commissioners.I regret not being able to say as much of some of his colleagues.During this period, the Postal Services Directive has not indicated any real progress.Commissioner Monti said it came out in part from the organization and the new task allowance.All this only took place recently.For more than a year, the former commission could have worked on this file.We have hardly advanced.However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like to charge him to tell the Commissioner Bolkestein what the directive on postal services was dealing with.It dealt with progressive liberalization, a universal service guaranteed at a reasonable price, it dealt with the maintenance in the reserved sector of direct mail and cross -border mail.These questions were fundamental in the report concerned and they should be fundamental in any future directive.The postal service is not limited to the Christmas period.It is useful life.In the region of Scotland where I come from, it is much more than a simple postal service.It is used to maintain the link between communities.Postal service is also the bus service.Postal service is also social service.Postal service is also the doctor.If we authorize the complete privatization of postal services, we will lose all this and many of our local communities will lose their tourism - we voted earlier on this subject.We will cut them from the world.Postal services are important.This message must be transmitted from this enclosure today.The commission must listen to it.Mr. President, we are in favor of the liberalization of postal services in the European Union.This liberalization must first note that customers will be better served.This is the orientation, such must be the final objective.Liberalization began because we had doubts about the structure of postal services, on the value of a monopoly.Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where customer demand can change very quickly and where the market situation can also vary very quickly, because we would use, for example, much more importantly the electronic information media?	fr
"It does not delight me as a parliamentary, but I have to consider it at least for the moment and so far. However, this also means that the Commission is facing a tremendous challenge. Mr President of the Commission, if you want to bring about the great turn you mentioned, you will have to start it soon. Mr President of the Commission, you, in the previous Parliament, suggested in the speech of this responsibility that the Commission should focus more on its core activities in the future. This can also be appointed to implement and implement the principle of subsidiary. However, it must be clear to us that this must not be about ignoring the Commission that is too complicated and difficult. Mr President of the Commission, it must also be clear to us that these criteria and this work must be started already. We cannot expect a white book, because there is already too much to deal with the Commission that may be considered from this point of view, while other things need to be done faster and clearly. We are not distinguished by the Social Democrats from other political groups in this Parliament so much the abundance of tasks or the number of proposals to be submitted, but of course the direction. We want to clearly and unequivocally strengthen the international role of Europe and improve competitiveness. For us, it must be, above all, to formulate Europe more socially, create equality in Europe, and improve safety and quality of life in Europe. However, we do not want to bureaucratic and concentrate Europe. It's not our perception of Europe! Mr President of the Commission, if you work for this, we fully agree with you. I'm going to another thing now. You have given Parliament a long list of projects related to the legislative program to Parliament. In our wisdom, we have decided to draw up a resolution that may not be quite so long, but which is presented to you numerous proposals and partly suggestions. This change of lists is not an ideal form of dialogue. Therefore, we should come up with something else in the future. Mr President of the Commission, I ask you to give you a priority of your success or your failure to evaluate and explain to what extent you have also achieved what you have done so that we can both move on to a better, ideal and constructive dialogue. This feels much more sensible to me than what we do the best time this week again, but hopefully the last time! Mr President of the Commission, I would like to return to your concept of the ""turn of the turn"" once again. It is all about our responsibility to follow in individual countries, not just the discussions on Europe in their home country. In this respect, I am actually terrified over and over again that we have not yet succeeded in convincing citizens of this European necessity, and first and foremost, we have not managed to convey them that our only chance to keep globalization is a strong Europe that does not need to regulate everything, but still. It is not about preventing globalization, and we would not succeed. It can only be that globalization is shaped for our values ​​and diversity. In addition, we must succeed together to unequivocally improve the communication that you also talked about. You are preparing a communication strategy for the expansion of the European Union. Mr The Commission Chairman, however, will only reach a real turn if we also succeed in considering each individual project and each individual legislative project, how we can convince citizens with the need for that project. If we do not succeed in this better communication technology, our common goal will not be achievable, namely, reaching a higher turnout in the next European Parliament elections."	fi
"The common will to overcome this terrible and still current history of the twentieth century, when all humanistic ideals were destroyed in the middle of Europe, is the real importance of the European Union.And if a government with neo -fascists is received somewhere in Europe, it is not just a question of national sovereignty.Because our Union is not a loose network of nation states that come to terms with each other in order to face better.It is a community of fate in which when it comes to essential questions when basic values ​​are at risk, all democrats have to search for solutions to prevent the mistakes of the past from repeating themselves.We should draw the teachings from the past.In the 1930s, when Adolf Hitler was democratically chosen, a minority believed that it was not that bad, and, Mr. Poettering, in my country, some people from the right warehouse thought, but certainly also representatives of other currents: ""Dear Hitler than the Volksfront"".They gave priority to small -scale party ducks instead of concentrating on the essentials - and there was a disaster.We have to react quickly, decided and together.I would have liked to have seen it, Mr. Poettering, if you had spoken to the Austrian President, which is known that this dirty coalition government is very embarrassed.So we have to react quickly and quickly.Of course, the contract offers protection when the situation becomes unbearable, I almost said ""not to make up"".The story has taught us that the fascists are going to do after the change of change: First hot - populist and xenophobic speeches - then cold - they are presentable, are represented in institutions that they gradually infiltrate and undermine them in order to then hit one day.And then it's too late.Now protective measures are provided in our contract if it is too late.But we are not that far: Today it is important to prevent it that is that far.So we need a political solution.Therefore, I support the council's proposals and at the same time regret the somewhat careful and tentative behavior of the Commission, which should actually be constantly determined and vigilant, because the fascists calculate with the weaknesses of democracy, they set temporary time to worry and hope to finally assert themselves.So we have to react quickly.If we do not support the council today, the story will judge us and speak of a ""political Munich"".Mrs. President!I am pleased that in Austria the will of the vast majority of the population is respected and that democracy has achieved a very significant victory in my eyes with this government formation.One thing has to be said very clearly: to a Europe that has developed into a kind of big brother who wakes up in a Stalinist and with Stalinist methods about the left -wing political correctness of the Member States, we say to such a Europe: No thanks.European democracy and Austrian democracy do not have to be instructed by anyone, in particular not from the Belgian government, which belonged to the corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and who have appointed the chairman of a corrupt party as a member of the European Commission."	de
"The only possible development of the European Union is that it wants to overcome this terrible past of the 20th century, which killed all the ideals of humanity in Europe and is still full of today. If a government somewhere in Europe is aligned with neo -fascists, it is wrong to think that it would be purely the internal thing of that state, as our Union does not consist of any parallel nation states that could organize their future affairs to deception. The Union is a community of the future, where all parties and all democracies have to fight to find solutions in a situation of vital issues and values ​​so that the mistakes of the past are no longer repeated. We have to learn from our past. While Adolf Hitler was elected in the 1930s as a democratic election as a minority representative for the Diet, many did not consider the choice very dangerous. And a member of poettering, some men and women in the right at that time thought in my country and perhaps elsewhere that Hitler is a better choice than the folk front. They ignored the essential in their corner, and the tragedy was realized. We have to react quickly, strongly and as a cohesive front. Member Poettering, I would have liked to have spoken to the President of Austria, because we are very aware that he was very bothered by the Grease of the Government of his country. So we have to react quickly and strongly. Of course, the establishment agreement provides for the pendants, if the situation begins to become intolerable, I would even say ""irreversible"". History has taught that fascists always turn their jackets according to the situation. First, they speak in a populist tone and stir the alien hatred, after which they rest to fit into the various institutions they are infiltrated and gradually become frustrated to move on to a beautiful day from words to deeds. But it is too late at that time. Therefore, our establishment agreement includes the solvents I mentioned above in case of situations where it is too late. However, we are not yet in such a situation, so we now have to make sure we don't have to resort to any restraint. So we need to find a political solution. Thus, I support the council's presentations and somewhat regretting some of the Commission's weakness and invertebrate, although it should demonstrate constant vigilance and constant determination, as fascists lower the fragility of democracy and the passage of time to see us and eventually reach the neck. So we have to react quickly. If we do not give our strong support to the Council now, we can be condemned in the light of history and people can say that Munich's political events have been repeated again. Mr President, I am delighted that Austria respects the will of the majority of the people, and the formation of this government is, in my opinion, a very important victory for democracy. Let's express it very clearly: for Europe that evolves into a kind of ""big brother"", which in a stalinistic way and by stalinistic methods monitors the left -wing correctness of different Member States, that is, to such Europe we say ""no thanks"". European democracy and Democracy of Austria have no learning from anyone, especially from the Belgian government, which represented corrupt parties funded by arms dealers. The Belgian government has appointed such a right to be a member of the European Commission of the Corrected Party convicted of the European Commission. Today, we thank the people of Austria for this victory in democracy, which is important to all European nations and all those who consider freedom and free expression of opinion as a paramount importance. Mr President, this discussion was opened by Da Costa, Chairman of the Council, who only confirmed that the EU Presidency is trying to influence the composition of one Member State board. This discussion and its background reinforced the view that the Socialists dominate the Council, the Commission and the Parliament. My delegation, which includes 37 members of the United Kingdom Conservative and Unionist Party, is definitely rejecting the basic philosophy, program and priorities of the Austrian Freedom Party."	fi
"We are looking forward to interest and confidence of a concerted strategy for modernizing social security systems in Europe, which, however, must not be separated from a parallel rapprochement process: this means modernization, but also cohesion, as the rapporteur, to which we agree, highlighted in his report.In many policy areas, this latter path, although under trouble, was initiated, but in many others it has to be hit before Europe, be it, be it, even when considering the principle of subsidiarity, really a common house not only for the citizens of the Member States, but also for the people of the accessible countries.The European systems of social security have also always played a positive role in the social and democratic development of every people;And since these systems today have to continue to act as support for development in view of the further development of the economy, the world of work and the needs of society, they must of course be modernized.Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize three aspects: First, there must be a closer, directly proportional connection between economic policy, employment policy and social security policy.Second, it is about managing the systems of social security and their carriers.Nowadays, more extensive and effective measures are taken in the area of ​​additional and supplementary provision.In our opinion, however, this should not mean that the role of the public sector is weakened, both because of the universality and because of the - desirable - quality of the basic services of social security.This is basically a principle of justice that applies to the healthcare system, for the pension systems, but also to the social welfare sector, in which the public sector of the strategic coordination - which - albeit in a new form - cannot evade.The third aspect affects the principle of subsidiarity, which is based on the Union.To date, there is no common strategy of social protection and social security, and the applicable systems are essentially based on the procedure and on solidarity within the Member States.When modernizing these systems, the differences between the individual states - be they now member or membership states - are not neglected in the areas of economy, employment and social protection.The modernization, which is closely associated with a process that is closely based on different requirements, must therefore strive and promote developments in the sense of an increase and not a lowering of the social protection level.This is a question of culture, progress and the common dignity of the current and future expanded European Union.The common values ​​of the Member States of the European Union are based on democracy, human rights and freedom as well as a social market economy.This spirit must be expressed in solidarity with the weak groups in our society and the outside world.In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the Member States design their social security systems themselves. However, all citizens of the European Union should be able to enjoy a minimum supply by a social security network, regardless of the country in which they live.In the report, an ""effective and ambitious tax coordination"" is required without define it in more detail.In our view, such an opinion means too much intervention in the national tax policy and therefore cannot find our support."	de
This means for me an additional improvement that can be achieved, and I think it would also be good if the name of the fund provided consumers and investors some information on the risk structure of that fund. The Mr President, the Mr Commission representative, the now -to -deal directive proposal brings with it a number of welcome reforms to the current provisions. For the most part, a effective balance has been found in the preparatory work to increase the efficiency and growth of the European investment markets without compromising on sufficient protection for the consumer buying fund units. The greater the more confidence in the consumer in the investment market, the more consumers are willing to invest in the open market. The more consumers invest, the brighter the financial markets of European companies look. After all, it is clear that as companies have access to equity funding, the balance sheet structure of companies is on a healthier basis, and thus also improves growth and investment opportunities. Whether or not money comes to the stock market as a direct investment or through a joint investment company is not relevant in this regard. Although we were largely agreed by the Legislative Reform in the Committee on Economic Affairs and Monetary Affairs, the committee processing was not the easiest. At least for me, personally caused difficulties in the Directive's technical division into two different proposals, which at least did not make it easier to explore this very difficult technical topic. However, I would like to bring out my position on a few detailed suggestions. First of all, I am very pleased that the proposal for a directive as a whole will increase the freedom of mutual funds to direct financial capital to different instruments. As far as derivatives are concerned, I consider the position accepted by the committee to be justified - unlike, for example, Randzio -Plath. OTC derivatives do not need to be treated in the Directive, unusually from standardized derivatives, as they are used in most Member States and these OTC derivatives have also been used earlier. For the second Article 5g of the second proposal for a directive, the so -called delegation articles, I think the original proposal of the Commission on the rules on authorization was better than now approved by the Committee, so I support some Villiers checks. Mr President, this morning's debate, I think there are two problems. First of all, when I came to Parliament many years ago, I was told that if you had a difficult job, give it to a liberalist. Now I have been told that if you have a difficult conversation, you know you are in trouble if half of the Luxembourg members are in Parliament at the same time and now it is. First of all, I have a positive attitude towards the first proposal. It simplifies and modernizes things. It seems to me that many British members vote against several reports. We support the first proposal of Schmidt's report, but we regret to impose many quantitative restrictions in the Directive that reduce opportunities to decentralize risks. In our opinion, a free market is the best solution. Secondly, we believe that the second proposal is very confusing. It is difficult to understand, and in our opinion, it would be best for the Commission to deal with it again. If we need to increase regulation, we could, in our opinion, be implemented by means of a non -Directive. We do not accept the proposal, especially for capital requirements, because if the requirements are set too high, they may actually expel some companies from the industry. We ask the Commission to re -process these proposals. Finally, we would urge members to vote, in particular, against the capital requirements 41, because we believe that it would have a very adverse effect on the industry. Mr President, Pecunia non, money does not smell, said ancient Romans. It is important that the money spare money. This is the only opportunity where we can bring out the interests of economists to those who want to earn and think only dollars like Roope Duck, which is described in the eye of the dollar, except that in this case it is a symbol of the euro. Here we combine the interests of these citizens with the interests of pensioners who want a peaceful life. For example, my Lankko, who lives in Rome, retired a year ago, and since then, he has been every day - in the morning, since he wakes up until midnight - followed the evolution of the retirement funds and securities he has invested in.	fi
Since approx. 80 % of the European population live in urban areas, the cities are the focus of Europe's economic, social and cultural development.At the same time, the social and economic problems of European society in cities are much more expressed.Many European cities are confronted with an internal territorial break, which is expressed in the fact that in one and the same city quarters in which economic activities are located with high value creation and live strongly inhabitant residents, among other quarters, which are characterized by low income, mediocre and overcrowded apartments and strong social welfare dependency.The concentration of social and economic problems in certain urban areas requires targeted intervention that meets the complexity of the problems.Therefore, the European Parliament has successfully demanded the continuation of the Community Initiative (GI) Urban as part of the reform of the structural funds.The success of urban in the planning period 1994/1999 is undeniable.Concrete successes have been achieved in the form of improving the quality of life in the funding areas.This GI has promoted the development of good practices in the economic, social and ecological field.One of their successes consisted of strengthening the role of local authorities, non -governmental organizations and the local authorities as well as in the promotion of new partnership forms in urban resuscitation.With the new initiative, these goals are increasingly continued, with the focus in particular on promoting the equal opportunities of men and women as well as the integration of the socially excluded and disadvantaged groups.Your assumption is therefore only to be welcomed.However, it can be determined that we have no reason to cheer in financial terms, because the intended middle equipment is far from being the challenges to be mastered.It has shrunk from 900 million euros for the period in 1994/1999 to 700 million for the years 2000/2006, which corresponds to a reduction by 30 %!This reduction has led to a reduction in the number of programs as part of the new Urban initiative.The chosen upper limit of 50 programs is undoubtedly too low.It must be increased in order to be able to take regional and local peculiarities into account without the central grants to be reduced to the Member States.In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and distribution of the results of the new community initiative Urban may play a crucial role in achieving a multiplier effect.The McCarthy report on the Urban Community Initiative is an opportunity to think about the appropriateness of community intervention in the field of cities.The location of certain urban areas is alarming because the social hardship is expressed in the form of unemployment, misery and crime.In particular through drug trafficking, uncertainty and procurement crime lead to.The effectiveness of the structural funds remains doubtful to such social problems.Because of the subsidiarity, we should actually say that the state is better able to intervene here in a reasonable manner in the exercise of its sovereign tasks and the local authorities, namely the state to ensure security and the local authorities to support needy.The intention to create a system for the exchange of proven practices can only be welcomed, but the specific problems of the individual urban areas are not always comparable.The Urban Community Initiative, together with the intention of the European Union, depends on urban politics.	de
This weighs all the more severe than the new situation, which is created by the course taken by the extension of the extension around regions such as Malta, is not taken into account.That is why we propose to extend the eligible regions at least to the nuts III borders of Sicily - in connection with Malta - and to all regions of the Adriatic - in connection with the Balkans.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would like to express my satisfaction that the regions in the extreme outer location, which also include French overseas departments, was given a certain attention as part of the Interreg III Initiative.This opened up new opportunities for cooperation with the countries of their geographical zone.Nevertheless, it should be noted that we could have expected better results, especially at the level of access to the individual orientations.For a long time, and this is undoubtedly due to the continuation of colonial ways of thinking, our regions have directed the view of their European capital and even ignored their closest neighbors.This phase is clearly overcome today.Our regions have become aware of the affiliation to an environment that they are bound not only for geographical, but also for cultural reasons and due to the history of their peoples.Therefore, the will, which was expressed unmistakably, comes after a firmer anchoring in this environment.However, this new self -image does not only affect identity.It is also based on the fact that we got to know our advantages better.The island of Réunion is on an axis of the exchange between the states of southern Africa and Southeast Asia.It cannot afford a demarcation from the regional groups active in this zone, otherwise it could be missed a historical opportunity.This also applies to our Caribbean region.Ultimately, we are convinced that our youth can find a way out of the discouraging, dramatic unemployment if we can export your know-how to neighboring countries with the help of the European Structure Fund.By using interreg funds, our regions can develop into true bridgeheads of the European Union in their respective geographical zones and thus give it a global dimension.I count on the commission, and above all on you, Mr. Commissioner, when it comes to making these regions available to the funds for effective measures.Mr. President, Dear Members of the Commission, the opportunities for increased Trans -European cooperation within the framework of Interreg encounters my pronounced approval, but I have to express my concern that the proposal contains fewer possibilities of this kind for coastal regions than for the other regions.I understand the concern of the Commission that large distances can have a negative impact on effective cooperation.Nevertheless, there are a variety of coastal areas between which contacts have already been linked.The numerous municipalities on the North Sea are an excellent example of this.Interreg would be very possible to reinforce this cooperation.For this reason, I would like to enforce some minor corrections on the guidelines and thus cause a little more flexibility and that the interests of sea areas that are often located between orientation A and orientation B are taken into account.For example, the possibilities for cooperation between coastal regions and the creation of a freedom for the increased design of practical and visible projects should be analyzed, especially in the area of ​​infrastructure.	de
"I agree with everything about what the Commission member said in his speech, but I would ask how long it takes to make sure that the action is taken and the problem is solved as he proposed. As a politician, he has to remind his officials how difficult it would be if he had to return to Parliament in a year, and if a similar, equally devastating accident happened, if some of his actions were just beautiful to be beautifully words and would not have been able to implement them. The possibility of such an accident in the near future should miraculously clarify the thoughts of his and his officials. Mr President, Dear Member of the Commission, I brought you a small gift: Here is an oil paste from a resident of a Noirmoutier Island who writes me as follows: ""Each tide leaves the beach with Erika's heavy fuel oil. The devastating accident is over? ""The Erika tanker accident, as well as the Russian ship's accident off the Turkish coast, is indeed something we cannot accept and tolerate during the time when high technology has been developed at its peak. An even more unbearable accident is the fact that it happened 20 years after the accident of Amoco Cadiz, when it had been repeated several times ""Never again!"". So it is our responsibility to guarantee the safety of shipping. We really have to guarantee the citizens that such an accident does not happen. However, as we listened to you, a consignment member of the Commission, we became a little frustrated, as those who are familiar with these issues already know that in 1992, the Commission and Parliament prepared a very interesting text, which already contained all the proposals in the resolution presented by the Committee on Transport today. It is true that this issue has to be talked about and has to be repeated: Erika's accident was an unnecessary disaster. For this reason, the European Union must urgently start a thorough review of its maritime directive to increase their bindingness and to create a clear and accurate cargo owners. It is worth knowing that Shell and British Petroleum, for example, had refused to use Erika tanker in their oil transport. So why not the Total company that has been the charterer not held accountable? You also need to provide for dual grazing in your proposals and that the ban on oil pumping into the sea will eventually be followed. A European control group must be set up to accurately and efficiently control the condition of the vessels. In addition, the European Union must equally urgently start reforming IMO. What is the steam to adjust binding directives if most of the ships do what they want as soon as they get to the sea? Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I think of all those volunteers, nature and bird lovers who have spontaneously and noble to help the oil-stained birds and have arranged their salvation by means available. I can provide evidence of this significant work. You know for sure that about 200,000 birds die due to this oil damage, which is a serious and virtually unprecedented ecological disaster. You also know well how difficult it is to protect animal species today and how difficult it is to maintain habitats. In this respect, you, a member of the Commission, did not say anything about how the Commission intends to support the recovery of nature and environmental balance. Let's say once again that the culprit cannot be clearly demonstrated. So far, nature is always defeated. Mr President, my group asked for this debate to give our Parliament the opportunity to express their solidarity with those who have suffered from this ecological disaster that has been harmful to their financial activity and their emotional relationship with their natural environment. Sallinette that in this context, I welcome Javette -Le Besque, a representative of the Morbihan Departement citizens, to our general leaf."	fi
".(FR) I was pleased to know in June last year about the decision of the Cologne European Council to convene the Committee on Preparatory (which includes representatives of the States and Government Principals, the European Parliament, the National Parliament and the Commission) to draw up a fundamental right. This book of fundamental rights is essential so that we can continue the political deepening of the European Union in good conditions. In fact, it can be used to fill a deficiency that has existed from the time the Union and the European Community's powers were extended together with European institutions, which make decisions that are more directly affecting European citizens. These latter must have a text to which they may invoke their defense in the European Court of Justice. For this purpose, direct appeal must be ordered in accordance with certain detailed regulations. In addition, the fundamental rights book ""helps to define a common inheritance of values ​​and principles (...), whose citizens know their own and influences the internal and external policies of the Union"", the legacy that we must constantly defend against racist and anti -alien efforts that are unfortunately not lost! Our Parliament must, as a representative of the peoples of the European Union, be particularly alert regarding the content of this document. European citizens must make us bold. Our requirements are clear. The Charter must be legally binding, as it is included in the Treaty. For this purpose, the Committee on Basic Agreement, Rules and Institutions asks the Council to record the Charter on the HVK agenda. All changes in the Charter of the Charter must be made in accordance with the same procedure as it has been drawn up, including the supporting statement of the European Parliament. The European Parliament shall accept all the provisions of the derivative law that may affect fundamental rights. The undesirability of fundamental rights must be recognized and their application sector must be extended to all union's institutions and all policies (including policies within the second and third pillar sectors) in the framework of the powers granted in the Treaty. Member States must comply with the Charter of Charter when they apply or incorporate the Union's law as part of their national legislation. With regard to the actual content of the Charter, it seems that it is desirable to divide the rights into three categories. The fundamental rights book would define civil rights directly to European citizenship, such as the right to vote, the right of appeal, the right to invoke the Ombudsman;Human rights, ie the rights and new rights protected by various international organizations (bioetics, personal data protection) and social rights: right to minimum income, strike rights, right to unemployment benefits. I conclude my speech by stating that this book of fundamental rights must be designed as a key tool in a procedure that must be led to creating its own constitution for the European Union!.(EN) I would like to indicate the reasons why I considered that I was forced to refrain from voting in the final vote, even though I am fully in favor of protecting basic freedoms and rights, like other members, and I want to make sure that future social development can be taken into account. Already, the Member States of the European Union have been ratified and transferred to their own legislative systems a European Human Rights Convention, which, although it is more than 50 years old, has shown to develop at the same pace with changing circumstances and develop new rights. I believe that what is now presented with this new book of fundamental rights will eventually lead to a contradiction in the interpretation of rights, which could create a legal vacuum and reduce existing rights, which would be ironic. We need more time and debate on these possible conflicts..(SV) The European Council meeting in Cologne decided to prepare the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. The purpose of the fundamental rights book was to collect and to confirm the rights mentioned in the agreements and to make them clearer and more visible. We consider the fundamental rights book that may, of course, also contain rights recognized in existing international conventions signed by Member States. At the same time, human rights must be considered as an international and global issue, not just as a matter of EU citizens."	fi
The fishing sector in Europe is facing serious problems and I am a staunch supporter of the fishing sector. Consequently, I call on the Commission and the Council to find the information, the political will to provide long -term real -time solutions for fisheries communities and not depend on short -term solutions. I recommend exposure to the body. The Environment Committee is generally pleased with the Commission's announcement and also expresses its satisfaction with the fact that the Fisheries Committee has adopted all our amendments. It is now widely accepted that the effects of fishing on the marine environment are much more extensive and distorted by the simple fishing of various target species, with accidental fishing and a small number of other species. We are pleased with the committee's intention to integrate environmental protection into other EU policies, including common fishing policy. After all, the circumstances state since 1992 that the principles of protecting and protecting the environment must be incorporated into Community policies. But as highlighted, the adoption of a strict definition of the prophylaxis principle is vital. This is because it is very easy to give dishonest promises and then continue our business activities as usual. The UN agreement on 1995 fishing stocks could serve as a good example of it. However, one aspect received in the announcement is the aspect of supervision and control. All good policies and good regulations in the world will not lead to maintaining without the existence of an effective system that will ensure compliance with laws. The control is the responsibility of the Member States and the Council recently adopted a list of serious violations in order to coordinate to some extent the rigor with which similar violations are treated in the various countries. This is a good step forward, but as the Commission and the Fisheries Committee constantly point out, there must be other improvements in the control programs of all Member States. I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on the excellent report by Mr President, fishing is a basic economic activity, which requires very important investments and providing basic employment in quite adverse conditions, undoubtedly, in entire Community areas. Nevertheless, the image that some people have about fishing is to be schematically simplistic, and may be from the simple traditional to its offensive to be considered a pirate and breath. I am sorry to say that this exhibition, due to its interconnection with the environment, seems to have given people the opportunity to take advantage of this kind to exploit it to say their stupidity. If Mr Katiphoris' report had been approved in its original form, I believe that none of the members of the Fisheries Committee could go back to a fishing area without being at risk of lynche. The relationship between fishing and marine ecosystems is obvious. However, this relationship is much wider and includes many factors, such as infection or maritime transport. The responsibility for environmental deterioration exclusively to fishermen is both unfair and untrue. Our Commission itself avoided shame with a series of amendments, of which I myself submitted no.14, many of them were accepted by the rapporteur, which I sincerely thank him.	el
However, I cannot help but mention that the same authorities expressed concerns about the pressures that they may be subject to the issues of division, questions that clearly require some concessions. This is related to progress in the case of population transfer and the possibility that the transfer of the population could be reviewed if a different solution were made on the island. On the other hand, the Turks of Cypriot are afraid - this is useless to hide - that harsh could tighten their position on this issue now that Turkey is a candidate for the European Union. I believe that while all of this can arouse fear in both communities, these aspects that allow the authorities on both sides to make a negative interpretation of the situation, they may also be an indication of some hope to find the final solution. This final solution depends quite clearly on one of the very important things that reflect the current relationships in the area, namely the very favorable development of the relationship between Athens and the harsh, and Foreign Minister George Papandreou and Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Cem in these relationships. We believe that such a situation is favorable for favorable development. For our part, we continue to monitor this development, by the Council's Presidential State, and cooperate with the Secretary -General and his or her personal representative. We inform the Community institutions about what we do and do not only at the political level, but also to what the Commission can accomplish in its administration of the accession process, and we are particularly informed of the flexibility of both parties in this issue. Mr President, we have heard the statements of the Council and the Commission, and I would like to make the following comments. Mr President of the Council, I understand that you have to have a sensitive view of the question and try to connect with a Cypriot Turkish party, but maybe it would be clearer and better if the vocabulary you used would not leave the suspicions that it is possible to try some kind of indirect recognition, even though you are not. For example, I wouldn't talk about Nicosia's government. Mr President of the Council, this is the government of Cyprus, not the Nikosia government. This government has proposed a way in which the Cypriotian party could participate in the procedure, and in my opinion, the Council and the Commission would properly try to get the Cypriot Turkish party institutionally participate in the negotiations that the Republic of Cyprus is undergoing. On the other hand, the way in which the question of the end of financial records has been dealt with so far is raising some doubts. I do not understand why the exception should be made for two small countries, why a confrontation between the institutions was needed, why the parliament was pressured to transfer the headers to heading 7, which concerns the co -subscription strategy. It cannot be allowed that the entire European Union is treating two small states at the border of the Union in this way, as the Union needs these states and are all capable of operating in the Union and is already considered to be ready to participate in the Economic and Monetary Union. I agree with a member of the Commission who said that a political decision must be made. Mr President of the Council, this is a small political decision compared to the benefits and, above all, to help two communities form in practice one state that they would really converge again - it was a time when the two communities were close - and that the republic of Cyprus would be released from the occupation forces. Mr President, good colleagues, we have, within the framework of the joint decision, taken a proposal for the Council's decree on the implementation of strategy in Cyprus and Malta's accession. This proposal is similar to the proposals made to other applicants, and when implemented, it will replace the financial protocols that have ceased to exist. Interface preparatory tools aim to promote technically and economically the efforts of the applicant states to meet the requirements of the Community Code.	fi
It is high time that polluters are starting to pay because, until now, the victims and taxpayers pay.And not only that they pay, but that in addition they clean the affected areas.I therefore welcome the response of Mr. Fischler, especially when he recognizes the need to apply retroactive measures and to provide a quick response to the requests that arise.I want to send on behalf of my group, the socialist group, a message of solidarity to victims, fishermen, aquaculturers and oyster farmers and to industrialists who ensure that seafood occasionally arrive on the markets;to mayors and political leaders, volunteers who have cleaned.We tell them about all our solidarity.I would like to ask two questions to the commissioner.Parliament has adopted a resolution on the application of the principle of polluter pays for this type of case and on the responsibility of the shipowners and owners of the goods.The question I ask the Commissioner is whether we can really apply these principles and if we will receive compensation from these people?The second point concerns the future and publication of the white paper of the Commission on environmental responsibility, the object of which is to guarantee in the future the application of the principle of polluter pays and to improve our ability to enforce European environmental law.This white paper admits that responsibility is only effective if the polluter is identifiable, if the damage can be quantified and if one can establish a clear cause and effect relationship between the two.The sinking of the Erika could not better illustrate this point because it sums up exactly what the white paper intends to tackle.This question would therefore seem to be the best measure to deal with such problems in the future.The proposal for a directive provides for a faultless responsibility for the damage caused by dangerous activities regulated at community level and I wonder -and the commissioner may perhaps answer this question -, if the white paper on environmental responsibility will be able to answer problems such as that of the Erika, if it will really be able to respond to this concern or if, in practice, in the practice of maritime accidents involving ships locatedPollutors will once again escape the obligation to pay compensation to repair the damage they have caused.Mr. President, our sympathies and the expression of our solidarity go to the people and the regions that have been affected by the disaster.But good intentions are not enough, the damage must be compensated and the losses compensated both with regard to the restoration of the environment and the conchyl installations and the fishing tools.We are happy to hear the Commissioner announces the need to act and compensate quickly and in a retroactive manner.We also denounce too lax control of ships and we are in favor of the creation of a European coast guard body, and in particular the requirement of more restrictive regulations and the requirement to have double hull boats.	fr
These rights are, by definition, universal rights. The Charter also applies to third -country citizens in the Member States, even though certain rights are limited to the citizens of the Union Member States. El Ejido's incidents were shocking, as more members said in their speeches. But if they were to find something positive, I hope they encourage us to implement our efforts to be tolerance, justice and freedom as real and effective policies that facilitate the lives of all families and individual citizens living in the European Union that request us understanding and help and not only in the future. Much thanks, the Member of the Commission. I declare the joint debate. The vote will be submitted at 6 pm. Human rights on the agenda are the following joint debate on the following resolutions: Violence between ethnic groups in Mitrovica and the situation of alban prisoners in Serbia, especially Flora Brovina's case B5-0140/2000 Dupuis and other TDI Group on the Kosovo situation;B5-0141/2000 Schori and others on behalf of the PSE group on the situation in Kosovo;B5-0150/2000 Oostlander and other PPE-de group from Kosovo;B5-0158/2000 on behalf of the Haarder Eldr group for the violence between ethnic groups in Mitrovica, the situation of Kosovo prisoners in Serbia, and especially the case of Flora Brovina;B5-0170/2000 My Morgantin and other GUE/NGL Group on the situation of Kosovo and the situation of albanic prisoners in Serbia;B5-0176/2000 Cohn Bends and other VertS/Ale Group on the situation in Kosovo and the situation of alban prisoners in Serbia;Freedom of the press in Angola B5-0148/2000 Dupuis and others on behalf of the TDI group on press freedom in Angola;B5-0151/2000 Cunha and others on behalf of the PPE-de group on freedom of expression in Angola;B5-0160/2000 Malmström on behalf of the Eldr group on freedom of expression in Angola;B5-0165/2000 Schori PSE group on behalf of freedom of expression, the independence of the media, and impartial trials in Angola;B5-0166/2000 Queiró on behalf of the group of Angola;B5-0178/2000 MAES AND OTHERS FOR THE VETTS/ALE Group on press freedom in Angola;US indigenous Dineh B5-0152/2000 Johan Van Hecke and Grosstête on behalf of the PPE-de group on the rights of the Dineh people, Big Mountain, Arizona, United States;B5-0157/2000 on behalf of the Sterckx Eldr Group on Dineh Nation's Rights, Big Mountain, Arizona, United States;B5-0163/2000 van Bremp PSE on behalf of the Dineh people, Big Mountain, Arizona, United States;B5-0171/2000 Cossutta and Vinci Gue/NGL on behalf of the Dineh people, Big Mountain, Arizona, United States;B5-0174/2000 on behalf of the Sörensen Verts/Ale Group on Dineh Nation's Rights, Big Mountain, Arizona, United States;Russian journalist Andrei Babitsk's case B5-0153/2000 Oostlander and Plylt PPE-de group on Russian journalist Andrei Babitskin's case;B5-0155/2000 on behalf of the Russian journalist Andrei Babitskin on behalf of the Trent and other PSE Group;B5-0156/2000, lying on behalf of the Eldr Group on the fate of Russian correspondent Andrei Babitskin in Tsetsenia;B5-0172/2000 on behalf of the Russian journalist Andrei Babitskin on behalf of the Vinci and Fraise Gue/NGL Group;B5-0177/2000 Schroedter and other Verts/Ale Group on Andrei Babitskin's case and human rights violations in Tsetsenia;Cambodia-B5-0154/2000 Morillo and other PPE-de Group need to bring red khmer in front of the International Court;Landing B5-0161/2000 and on behalf of the Wiebenga Eldr Group, the need for red khmer in front of the International Court. Mr President, before we start a conversation with Kosovo and Mitrovica, I have to say that I am overwhelmed by an unpleasant feeling. It is that this is not the first time we talk about Kosovo here. We have already accepted resolutions and we have found that they have been mostly warnings, resolutions that have no effect. I greatly appreciate the fact that the Commission has always been present in those discussions. In particular, I appreciate the fact that the Commission member Patte is present here and its authority. However, I say, like many of my other colleagues that the Council has been systematically absent from these discussions. However, we also need to work with the Council. I say that there is one diplomat representing the Council who enthusiastically records what we say and reports it, but nothing also happens. However, I demand that we need to change our procedures and that the Council must be present in current discussions so that we can negotiate it immediately.	fi
I believe that with regard to the concrete case of Erika, we are taking action and organizing actions with the French authorities.But what concerns us in the present case is that we should again debate this subject, because the quid of the question are preventive measures.The fishing commissioner reported - and I would like to insist on this - that the Commission will meet and adopt a pack of technical and legal measures.I think it's the way to follow.I would simply like to say that these measures are welcome and that the members of the fishing committee will make very punctual follow-up of these measures so that they no longer be led to meet in this Parliament to deplore facts such as this one.I received, in accordance with article 42, paragraph 2, from the regulation.5 resolution proposals.The debate is closed.The vote will take place at 11 am.CE/Israel Trade Agreement The agenda calls for the oral question (B5-0012/2000) of Ms. Morgantini and others to the Commission, on the irregularities in the application of the CE/Israel trade agreement.In reality, we must debate today a simple thing: respect, application and control of agreements to which the European Union subscribes, compliance with international treaties and standards to which the European Union adheres.It is a simple thing but in this world, it is often the simplest things that pose the most problems.The colleagues who have signed with me the question posed to the Commission want the correct application of the Israeli -I -CE Trade Agreement which - not only do we have reasons to believe it, but we hold, like several Member States, the concrete evidence - is openly violated by Israel.We also have reasons to believe that the Commission is not being held on what should be its basic mission: to be the guardian of community treaties.We are talking about article 38 of the territorial clause which limits the field of application to the territory of the State of Israel and which therefore does not authorize the granting of customs facilities to products from the territories occupied militarily since June 1967 in which, in defiance of all international laws, starting with the fourth Geneva Convention, the successive Israeli governments have implanted coloniesPalestinians their lands and their rivers and installing new inhabitants there.This is not the first time that the Commission and the Parliament have looked into these problems.I will recall only the report of the Commission to the Council and the Parliament presented in May 1998, which stigmatized the Israeli refusal to apply the Protocol of the Original Laws as referred to in article 38. Despite this, the Commission has failed to oblige Israel to respect these agreements and it has provided vague answers to the various questions of parliamentarians, constantly evoking the difficulty ofhas always reminded Israel the legal obligations of the agreement.In order to facilitate the task of the Commission and Member States, an Israeli pacifist movement has published a list of companies installed in the colonies and a Palestinian NGO has gathered and presented to the customs authorities of the various member countries irrefutable evidence on the origin of several products from the occupied territories and marketed in the community.	fr
For this reason, it makes sense to proceed in stages, as suggested by the Commission. The first stage is the setting of environmental milestones for 2010, which means cutting ozone loads hazardous to health by two -thirds by that year. However, we cannot be content with this, as there are too many areas after this goal, which is exceeded by quantities that are dangerous to both humans and nature. As a result, in my report, I have proposed not only the milestone but also the long -term goal and the final goal by 2020. At that time, we could finally achieve a situation where critical levels and loads are not exceeded and all people are effectively protected from all known health effects caused by air pollutants. In this context, I would like to pay attention to my case -related review, which, due to language errors, is the wrong word in your documents. The word to achieve should be exceeded. I hope this will be taken into account before the vote for tomorrow. So how do you achieve a situation where air impurities do not exceed nature and human tolerance? The Commission's proposal sets the limit values ​​for each Member State for certain interconnected emissions causing acidification, an increase in ozone in the area and eutrophication of the soil. Viewing these problems and emissions that cause them has proven to be the most cost -effective way to get into and discipline without impurities. Indeed, the major disagreements in the implementation of the Directive are related to the level of the limit values, that is, the emission limit set on each country. The UN Economic Commission of the European Economic Commission has also examined the targets for reducing the same sources of emission sources as the proposal for the Directive now discussed, and the so -called Gothenburg minutes have been signed as a result of these discussions. There is a clear difference between this proposal and the Commission proposal. If we settle for the level of Gothenburg's minutes, we will never come to achieve the goals that the Union has set for itself in terms of impurities. Comparing the differences in health effects of the Gothenburg Protocol and the Commission's proposal, the Commission's proposed reduction level will save the lives of up to four thousand people in Europe. While ambitious environmental goals have undoubtedly been shown to be part of the health and safety of citizens, the lower target level is defended by the fact that cleaner air pays too much for industry and societies. However, it has to be said that the cost has been exaggerated in this context. If, on the other hand, the benefits of better air quality are calculated for people and nature and buildings, it is result that the economic benefits are four times higher than the cost. The proposal for the Directive must still be able to be modified by others so that the situation in the applicants' countries and also the issues related to the immediate vicinity of the European Union are better taken into account..(EN) Mr President, after extensive discussion and careful consideration, the Committee on Industrialism definitely opposes the emission limits proposed by the Commission, and opponents represent different groups and nationalities. All of our Member States, candidate states and other countries approved the UN European Economic Commission (ECE) emissions limits in Gothenburg as recently and in the record signed in November 1999. Why has the Commission presented these even stricter and much more expensive emission limits just a month later? I understand that the groups and the whole parliament are divided into supporters of the Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Policy Affairs, and supporters of the Committee on Industrial Policy. Members of the Parliament should be aware of the serious consequences that the Commission's proposal would have for our industry, our competitiveness, our workplace and - yes to people and areas if accepted. The Industrial Committee urges the Parliament to vote for the reviews presented in the name of me and Member Bowe. The Committee of Industry has approved these reviews. UN emissions limits are sufficiently ambitious to achieve our internationally accepted goals within a reasonable time. The Industrial Committee hopes that these limit values ​​will be fully and properly implemented throughout the European Union and worldwide. After that, the Commission could focus on ensuring enforcement and finishing the models used, and it might be able to make new proposals after two or three years, based on much more convincing evidence of the cost and benefits.	fi
I am referring to transfers and regional policy policy. For both areas you have on your side, in the face of colleagues, Mrs Palacio and Mr Barnier, two excellent commissioners, and nevertheless do not pay the proper importance to these areas in the document for your strategy. Why do I say that? By examining transport policy you will find that it is very important to formulate this policy in an economic and environmental point of view in a reasonable way, and even before the integration of new countries. If the chairman of the Commission was listening to my words I would be grateful, but it is certainly not necessary. I will give you three examples: First, we need a rational release in the railway sector, because we want to relocate the transport of goods from road to rail transport, which is reasonable for both economic and environmental point of view. Without liberation we will not be able to pursue a rational transfers policy. This is equally concerned with the European Air Security sector. Citizens do not understand at all the fact that we release air transport, but in the sky we maintain the 15 different areas that are controlled nationally and imply financial losses for airlines, while polluting the environment. Mr Commissioner, Regional Policy is little refers to your document. The social and economic cohesion of the European Union is a central task of this community. If we do not fulfill it, citizens of the least favored areas will be afraid of enlargement. We need to make them clear that we will take advantage of the next five years to bring the disadvantaged areas closer to the rich, promoting and funding them in reasonable contexts. At that time, citizens of the least favored areas will be willing to agree and contribute to European enlargement. Mr President of the Commission, if we fail to create and implement solidarity between rich and poor areas, this union will become poorer and will not receive the consensus of the population. Madam President, Mr President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen, ladies and gentlemen, the formulation of new programs should not make us forget about the older programs that are in the implementation stage. In this respect, it is useful that the Commission's work program returns to the Agenda 2000 issues, the common agricultural policy, which includes fishing, and secondly the activity of the structural funds. I hope this report, Mr President of the Commission, means that the reorganization of the committee currently being made will not harm the control and implementation mechanism for the agenda 2000. The issues of the agenda 2000 are issues, of course, referring to your third and fourth strategic goal and fourth. What is not evident from your texts is to what extent the big ones, the high -profile goals are in line with the means that the Commission intends to mobilize. And I don't necessarily mean financial means. The implementation of Agenda 2000 in the agricultural sector does not necessarily need more financial means, after all. Economies need to be made. But these are the detailed means: the investment of intellectual capital in these issues.	el
I do not agree with the paragraphs concerning on the Parliament.This report concerns the Commission.Parliament is a separate subject.Nothing justifies the introduction of the Parliament in the discussion on the Commission.There is also the issue of tax purchases.It was an argument against the committee that the lobbies opposed to the abolition of tax -free sales at airports.This subject has nothing to do either in the report.The report mainly concerns financial control.This is reasonable, because it comes from the budget control commission.But it should not be given the impression that vast amounts of European resources are threatened by the negligence of the European Commission.After all, this represents only 1 % of GDP compared to national expenses.We have already discussed it, but some in Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how limited the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the Member States.The negligence of the commission in its expenses will therefore not threaten large amounts of money.We should take it into account.It is an element that is important to keep in mind.The action of the European Commission is very limited with regard to expenses.Its role is very limited.Its responsibility is much more important.Responsibility for environmental management, food security, foreign trade, internal market and many other responsibilities that we have entrusted to the Commission without providing it with the resources necessary to assume them.I am not one of those who think there is a cruel lack of confidence.If this is the case, it was us, in Parliament, who created it last year.I have been here for 20 years and I have always noted an absolute confidence between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.We have had problems, we have identified difficulties, but the citizens of the European Union have never failed in confidence in this bureaucratic commission, they never doubted it or never dreaded it because it managed our affairs badly.This is a great exaggeration of what the difficulties were.This commission should not be forced to live forever in the shadow of the errors which caused the resignation of the commission and which preceded it.When there are problems that we have to solve for enlargement, for example we sometimes insist far too much on their negative side.Mr. President, allow me to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report.I hope that the Commission will inspire it within the framework of its reform work.The reform process has been underway for some time and apparently reigns a kind of state of emergency within the Commission.It is clear that the way the commission administers business is not particularly good.There is obviously within the committee of capable and competent civil servants;They even represent the majority, but we need radical reforms.There are too few actions and too much bureaucracy.	fr
"I would also like to emphasize what President Gargani said earlier: The committee made a statement about the intermediate evaluation. He stated that on the occasion of the report to be prepared in accordance with Article 7 of the decision of the European Parliament and of the Council, it would evaluate the results of the program and this evaluation would also apply to budgetary resources in the context of the Community's fiscal prospects. If necessary, the report will include a proposal to modify the decision and all before June 30, 2002. Ladies and gentlemen, dear Members, is an official commitment and not just a proposal that will remain blank. All of this should lead us to reinforce our action in favor of utilizing a common cultural space, in which our cultures will be further blooming with all their particularities and differences. However, they will also be able to enrich themselves, and other European citizens will be fully involved. This was also contributed by the action of Parliament, which wanted to take more small actions that would approach the roots of citizens rather than major actions of impressive displacement. This will result in the ""Culture 2000"" program to become the Citizen Program. This increased involvement of our citizens, which I wish, I hope, therefore, is as widely and more fruitful as possible, and I am committed to working so that, in the five years covering the program, it becomes tangible reality. I know that you, MPs, will work in your regions, in your countries, along with those involved in the program for all these small flowers, as a colleague said, to compose a huge colorful carpet. I would like this program to make tangible reality and culture to represent for our citizens, not only a factor of wealth, both at a personal and socio-economic level, but also a right to ensure, as well as proof of a recovered happy coexistence within the Union. These are what our European program ""Culture 2000"" is cut. This is not a competition between the cultural policies of the various Member States. These policies are necessary and I would like to see them grow more. It is very simply an addition, a complementary, this is the bridge of the different cultures of our different countries. Therefore, in my opinion, the expansion and enhancement of the participation of European citizens in the cultural sector is a fundamental task that justifies our efforts and on this basis we need to measure the success of our action and our Union. Very rightly, various MPs pointed out: If a union is based solely on the economy, it is condemned from the outset. But if it was created by culture, if it is made up of cultural elements, if it was formed by participation, it will flourish. This is the basis, ladies and gentlemen, who I ask to grow and will take into account the following five axes in particular: first, providing innovative opportunities to our creators so that their talent can find the support it deserves in our program."	el
Another aspect of the emphasis is on increasing supplementation between the European Union and Member States' policies. It is known that a significant part of the aid is currently granted in national policies of Member States, which are not always complementary or coordinated;The waste or inefficiency granted by the European Union is largely due to what each Member State is doing and what the European Union intends to do or planned cannot coordinate or supplement. We, in our opinion, are also absolutely essential that we can soon do everything we can do to enhance the supplementary and coordinating mechanisms between policies and European policies by Member States. The third aspect of highlighting: Increasing the consistency of policies, which is the key topic of our discussion today. First of all, we all realize that we are not enough to improve the terms of support, and that other European Union policies need to be better integrated, so that the goals of development cooperation can be achieved not only through help and support, but also, above all, by adopting a more comprehensive view of the different policies related to the goals of development cooperation. As is known, in June 1997, the Council approved the resolution and the Commission undertaken to provide evaluation reports, the first of which was issued to the Council in May 1999. It already presents some aspects of policy coordination, especially in the field of peace building, food safety, fisheries and migration. As is also known, the Commission will soon provide communications about consistency and development policy. This debate can certainly be enriched in the coming months during the Portugal Presidency, based on the documents that the Commission gives us on this matter. The consistency of politicians will always be limited, which is clear, and it is natural that some kind of inconsistency of politicians is one way to balance and consider the contradictory and inconsistent benefits of the Union, and that only this way can be controlled by some kind of politicians' inconsistency. Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize that increasing the coherence of European policies in the current situation and current conditions of the Union requires that we really consider some of the European Union dynamics. I mean specifically the dynamics of the European Union. We know that the European Union now has its own dynamics, especially due to the Amsterdam Treaty, which will enhance its political dimension, which will also significantly affect the supposed consistency of development policies. We also have to wait for the results of the inter -governmental conference work and see what kind of dynamics are adopted there in order to see, the extent to which we can see the internal dynamics of the European Union, and in particular development cooperation to promote that goal with appropriate institutional arrangements. Another aspect of policies' consistency: Development policy in the context of foreign policy of the Union. We know that the Union's foreign policy now has a new dimension, and we know that the European Union has its own dynamics, which we cannot underestimate the role of development policies. We also know that there are aspects related to political dialogue, the acceptance of common positions or activities, the preparation of common strategies, preventive diplomacy, and the development of regional crisis and crisis management capabilities. Certainly, the implementation and development of all these aspects will significantly promote the improvement of the role of development policies in the European Union's foreign policy. It should be said that at the same level, at the same level of the European Union, the development of development policies in connection with foreign policy must certainly progress in the same way as many Member States agreed on their development policies in their own foreign policies, and this is definitely required to strengthen YUTP decision -making and agency structures.contact. In this context, we are convinced that we must move from the post -colonial model to a true European development policy model, knowing that we know that some Member States' policies have largely regulated European development policies in accordance with the post -colonial influence of these states.	fi
We also promote measures against businesses involved in counterfeiting. The new candidate countries must also adapt to these rules. It took two years the Council and the Commission to draw up this proposal. It is absolutely necessary to make a decision in March. It would be unacceptable for a delay that could perhaps damage the euro. It would also be a betrayal against the citizens who will use the new, unknown banknotes. It is believed in particular that counterfeiters are turning to countries outside the euro area, in which the knowledge of the new currency is meager. The protective measures also cover these countries and their views have taken seriously. This proposal could therefore be described as solidarity and mutual, because it defends intervals and is binding. The Council must now meet and make a decision in March. Thanks to my colleagues who listened to me. I also thank those who contributed to the rapid examination of the issue and thank the ESK team in particular. Mr President, dear colleagues, let me first of all congratulate the rapporteur, Mrs. Charlotte CederschifLD, on the drafting of this report, which is an exquisite starting point for enhancing criminal protection against the counterfeiting of the euro. The euro will be launched on 1 January 2002 and will since then be one of the main coins of storage worldwide. Due to the importance it will gain on a global scale, the euro will be particularly exposed to the risk of counterfeiting and fake. Therefore, the draft decision under consideration establishes some minimum arrangements in order to harmonize criminal law provisions in this area, seeking to make their application simpler and more effective. It also provides that the protection of the euro will be implemented before the currency is put into circulation, which comes to fill the legislative gap in some Member States. I would like to express my full agreement with the position of rapporteur on the need to expand this protection to national coins, which will continue to exchanged after their retirement. Each Member State will therefore ensure that it will establish effective and appropriate criminal penalties, which will prevent the actions characterized as offenses in the plan-framework plan. Regarding the proposal to establish a maximum threshold for the deprivation of freedom penalties that will not be less than eight years, I think it will not create any problems in my country, which already see the possibility of modifying the current provision of its criminal code,On the other hand, I would like to address a call to the few Member States who still have reservations so that they finally lift them up to make a decision on this issue as soon as possible, as the rapporteur has already pointed out and for the reasons he cited.	el
"First, the Committee for Development and Cooperation would like nothing more than the EEF communality, and it has clearly taken the wrong way.In our opinion, the cooperation is an intergovernmental task, and so it must remain.While Europe is preparing its expansion, the EEF agency would give some the opportunity to simply hide their lack of commitment behind the protective shield of the community budget, apart from the fact that this is the fact that one can give up a fruitful and promising method in this way with which we can participate in our policy of cooperation.And finally, the Commission has recently reminded Maes Maes - rightly reminded of it - what difficulties she has to manage the funds provided by it for her programs for development and humanitarian aid in all transparency.The question arises as to why you should add more programs.Second, we consider it extremely unfortunate that Mr. Corrie's report mentions the deal for trade and development with South Africa, because ultimately this agreement is an example of the unprofessional diplomacy that the European Commission is increasingly operating.We have to find completely amazed that the Union has negotiated an agreement for its Member States, in which an essential part was simply not filled with content.By the way, it is even more incredible that the council has approved this.So we are now in the absurd situation that we have to negotiate from a position of weakness about such important aspects as wine and agricultural production, and this as part of an agreement that has already been signed by us.The part of this agreement, which blocks the negotiations, could have the consequence for the Union that it must compensate for producers so that they hire the production of sherry and port wine.These are a whole range of products that are simply falsified according to international commercial law, and you can imagine the possible costs of such a precedent.This is the proof of this, if this has to be proven at all, that immature diplomacy that does not represent any interests - unless individual interests, trapped between the teaching of faith, the lobbies and the more or less friendly NRO - not only inefficient, but even dangerous.Finally, a word about the general direction of the report Corrie.Nowadays the parity assembly, we do not want to hide this, regarded by the ""theologians"" in Geneva and Washington as an obstacle to international free trade.This could have been an opportunity for us to remind you that our form of an independent and exemplary cooperation with the countries of the south should be further developed and reinforced.The Corrie report has wasted this chance, and to our regret, we have to condemn it that this chance was played in this way.President!As a conclusion and summary, I would like to highlight three essential aspects of this pronunciation.First, and in general, the idea of ​​the idea of ​​the idea is that globalization deepens regional disproportions and social inequalities and enlarges poverty.From this it follows that something has to be done, because otherwise the tensions exacerbate and develop conflicts that pose a danger to peace and stability at the international level.Second, from this point of view, it depends on giving development policy a new dimension by upgrading their role in the correction of disproportions and reducing inequalities."	de
The second principle is to avoid the fact that it is possible that the report will become a sack that packed goals, pious wishes, and principled petitions, which would not actually fall within the competence of the Member States of the Union, that is to say, in virtually and actually applicable rights. Our third guideline is in line with the basic stroke of the PPE group, that is, although we do not consider ourselves less generous or less open to others, we hope that the report is really emphasized by the rights recognized by State law, which is why we have in some cases to vote against a few rights that we otherwise consider fully. We have also wanted to avoid, wherever possible, that some countries are mentioned by name or highlighted, and therefore this year's human rights report does not systematically look at the situation. In addition, we have always wanted this subject to be subject to the principle of subsidiary and reminded that the protection of human rights is the task of Member States and that their potential violations are within the competence of national courts. Finally, we hope that next year's report will take into account the preparation of a fundamental rights book so that we will receive a reality report from next year, which will allow us to conduct a country and legal analysis alongside the preparation of the Charter. We hope that the next processing report will be expected even more frightened and that it shows how important our Union considers human rights in our regional community. Mr President, it is astonishing how rarely does this important human rights debate mentioned - the people who are most able to protect against human rights violations. In fact, children do not appear in EU agreements. Animals have rights, children do not. Still, the EU law and the cohesive market also apply to children. The electronic revolution has apparently increased the freedom of abuse, pedophiles and porn merchants more than the freedom of industrial leaders. Although we consider ourselves civilized, the 21st century still undergo slave trade, where children are bought and sold for sexual abuse throughout the world. There are problems in candidate states. There is currently a scandal in Latvia, which is said to reach the government. We see on television almost daily how child soldiers fight in the world. And in addition, the stories of the use of child labor are familiar to us all. We need to take more active measures. We have to take the kids on the agenda. This does not mean that the EU should introduce a policy on children, but we could start by ensuring that EU laws are safe for children as well. We should ensure that the Commission's actions have a specific dimension of children. We should make sure that someone is responsible for the children in the Commission. In 1998, the government of my country appointed a Children's Rights expert to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Children from the Save the Children to develop strategies and practical projects related to children's rights. Why can't we do the same? In the UK, there is also a so-called child enabler, which can explore the abuse of children and interrogate expert witnesses. Why can't we do the same? Can we make sure that the Charter is entering the Children's Department? I know we have communications. We have action plans and conventions, but we want measures, not good intentions. Mr President, why are human rights so badly behind as humanity develops? Science, technology and communication;People know and know more and more. However, the world is still undergoing extensive human rights violations. The main cause of them is war, poverty and abuse of power. So we have to concentrate all our efforts on them. However, cultural models are also the basis for insults. Therefore, it is correct that Malmström asks in his excellent report to pay special attention to the position of women. Women are still a victim of the official and sometimes even legal abuse of gender in many societies.	fi
Only a broad and democratic foundation guarantees the success of this strategy and we hope to receive support from you. Mr President, the four main goals of which EU government boards decided in November last year and mentioned earlier today, are the following: to ensure that work is worthwhile and that the livelihoods are safeguarded, to ensure pensions and to maintain pension arrangements, the social integration must be promoted.that everyone must be able to support them. After all, we can all just be wise if we give a high-level expert team to work as a connection to the exchange of experiences, and if we allow it to coordinate and evaluate the development of social and labor market policy. The Commission Communication, which we will discuss today and was the introduction to the Council's November decision, is a very balanced explanation of how we could have a higher quality debate on how we could obtain more information on the demands of social policy that will be affected by Member States in the coming years, when the number of aging people will increase. Even today, we have major social problems and social costs account for a major share of public budgets, which causes problems for many Member States. If we do not make reforms, we may weaken the economic foundation of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is the surest basis for good social security. So it makes sense that we connect these themes to the agenda. In the discussion on the coordination of the EU social policy, we often use the expression of social approximation. We liberals can support the concept of social approximation when it comes to introducing extensive goals in the EU that states are trying to meet through national social policy. So it is not a matter of harmonization, it is a common goal. The fact is that EU states have organized their social policy in different ways. Our traditions and cultures are different, and despite many similarities, the differences between states also occur in the quality and extent of social problems. Therefore, it is important to emphasize that social policy is a national matter. Of course, national policies include many frameworks on the social minimum rights recorded in the establishment agreement, taking into account the ensuring the free movement of labor so that social rights are not reduced, the consideration of the reconciliation and economic cooperation of economic cooperation. Therefore, cooperation and cooperation must be increased. However, approximation must be related to the goals, not the funds. I would also like to thank the report rapporteur, Jan Andersson, for his very constructive contribution to try to reconcile different positions and secure support for his own report. I can support the report, but there are some points that are not completely in my mind. I do not agree with the claim that the Commission should address the so-called unfair competition between social and tax systems if it prevents new thinking, developing and streamlining our social systems, or lowering too high tax burden in many EU Member States. I have doubts about the detailed regulation that may result in the Commission focusing on the extent and quality of child and elderly care, and I also doubt that the common poverty line would have the real benefit. Coordination of social policy and dialogue is a good thing, but we should not solve all things in the same way. Mr President and Members of the Commission, I would like to raise a couple of positive things and a couple of issues that arouse a couple of issues of social protection here to reform social protection here. I consider the movement that has happened slowly but surely in this matter. It seems good and necessary to me. I also find the major outlines of communication with the strategic approach. We therefore hope that the four these goals can be reasonably achieved. We also want to emphasize how important it is, that is, on the one hand, the Luxembourg process and the guidelines, but we also think it is important - Van Lancker said this - that provides provisions for, for example, atypical employment and entrepreneurs without personnel, etc.	fi
We cannot accept that we cannot carry out the environmental improvement of the Commission's guidelines, as they are considered a prohibited dock. Mr President, we accept the resolution of the GUE/NGL Group because it reveals the responsibility of Total-Finina for this ecological disaster and because I support the proposal to ban the use of comfort flagships and over-aged ships or to make dual grazing on oil tanks. I would just add that Total should at least finance the overall and indirectly repair of the oil disaster. How can the relapse of similar accidents be prevented without taking large -scale measures against large oil cartridges, as well as many other bodies that take the risk of gaining the Earth's unjustly? How can we not be angry that the bank refuses to reveal the names of Erika's owners, invoking banking, and the governments do nothing for the matter? The essence of the problem is that all governments and all European institutions recognize the right of the large Trust and all such companies like the Total-Finina at the expense of their employees and the environment. They recognize the trade secret of businesses and banks, even though it clearly protects criminals. As a result, even the best resolutions remain weak in principle, which do not prevent the damage of the large Trust. Mr President, good colleagues, I support that we tighten the provisions on the control of the port states and the regulations of classification facilities. However, we also need to remember the facts. The tank vessel Erika was examined in the last two years Four. Thus, it may not be the result of the number of studies, but rather to ensure the effectiveness of control measures. I have heard in discussions in recent weeks that Member States do not have enough money to carry out control! I can't accept this. If, with us, Member States decide that 25 % of the ships are checked on the basis of supervision by the port states, they must also provide the necessary staff! In addition, the control must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector does not only go to the ship and inspect whether there is a fire extinguisher, but must be subjected to material checks, as this ship was broken in half due to the excessive fatigue of the material. It can only be detected if the control is performed very efficiently. Our goal should be to ensure that the control of the port states is not superficial but also covers the material. Secondly, I also agree with the references of a member of the Commission and would like to encourage him to continue on this path. If it became clear that one or more rating facilities have made statements as a friend, they must be removed from the list of reliable rating facilities! This is the only deterrent to prevent other classification institutions also give statements as friend services. Dear colleague Roth-Behrendt, we have a shipping inspection. Classification facilities serve as ships! There are also good classification facilities. You know a few good institutions and our French colleagues know a few good institutions, but we have to look closely at which institutions do not meet the requirements and remove them from the list. The last paragraph: we should say unequivocally to Malta that if it wants to be a member of this community, it must apply to the registration and flag state control, which really satisfies our demands, because the environment is common and not one we can share! Mr President, a Member of the Commission, Erika sank in front of my home, still lying there in her body with 20,000 tons of fuel oil, which is not known about the fate. It could have been sinking elsewhere. It happened to sink there, not the Brittany I come from, to apologize for being geographically a peninsula because it often suffers from shipwrecks. First of all, I think of the 26 Indian sailors who were saved but are not spoken.	fi
I will take a special point of view again within the framework of it, as it has often been referred to in the United States. In the United States, these new markets, this innovation, this is the big leap forward in the dissemination of innovation that it is that telematics innovation can also be distributed to remote areas, in no case is there any initiative of private entities. Large investments have been made at federal level, at state level and at local level. They have been significant and have been investments in modern infrastructures. Note that in this case, we will repeat our immediate task, immediate public and other levels of the public, the construction of the highways of knowledge, that is, the roads where these new vehicles are passing. Markets, private parties and companies are building vehicles to move forward, but it is our responsibility to build new highways. So what Prime Minister Guterres said about computers at every school, a network that must cover all remote areas, is an obligation that cannot be left solely on the market because it simply cannot be done within the market, but on the other hand, without it, we cannot achieve them. So our job is to avoid crisis in remote economic sectors, which does not mean centralization, it does not mean centralized programming, but means that remote economics are given the same opportunities as centralized economic sectors. Here's the reason why the program needs to be allocated to schools, here is why we need to grasp the whole age group and act determinedly and do our best so that no one in that age group is excluded from new literacy. So the Lisbon summit has a very precise strategy. The real problem with Lisbon, in my opinion, is to convey a new kind of courage to deal with employment and growth issues, while also being aware that we are able to move towards it, and we have to move towards this model based on stable equilibrium. To make a summary of today's debate, I would like to use the expression that one of the members of the Parliament has been used by unless the wrong remomion, it was a member of the Goebbels that said there is a future deficit in Europe. This is simply all about. For a long time, we mourn ourselves, while at the same time the seeds we had sown with the great sacrifices to the roots of Europe produced fruit. I am asking, now trying to end this deficit for the future and gives new generations meaning and try to think that we are working together modestly but seriously for something sustainable. Therefore, it is clear that combining the three processes is essential. Unfortunately, our terminology is creepy, but now we really combine problems with macroeconomy, work and structural issues, and only then do we have the ability and opportunity to achieve the results that we wanted with quite simple, albeit special actions. Let's remember the European company: We have not yet reached a consensus on the European company, but hundreds of thousands of companies ask us. This we need to do at any cost, because the idea of ​​working in 15 countries, which are already being formed today, one with different rules on the basic principles of the company is impossible: we do not succeed in selling it because it has no point. The same goes for the European patent: we cannot sell it;The same applies to the rules on contracting, the capital market;Similarly, it applies to the seeds of social security coordination, as it is useless to think of great opportunities for mobility and that we create successful programs, such as Erasmus and Socrates, which allow us to get people to move more if we have social security rules that do not help us promoting that mobility.	fi
Mr. Provan said that I often talk about tourism and information technology.I am personally convinced that information and communications technologies will play a key innovative role in European tourism.The travel and tourism sector is at the forefront of the use of information and communications technology tools.This will deeply modify his way of operating.Marketing, reservation and transport are expected will be the areas that will undergo the biggest changes and the biggest improvements.The use of these technologies opens up a completely new dimension in the field of travel and tourism.Direct contacts between the consumer and the company will complete, and sometimes will also reduce the current and almost exclusive relationship of business to business.The offer to tourists will be more extensive and better and new products, of better quality, will be created.To do this, according to the Commission, it is necessary to closely link the action in the tourism field to the measures to promote information and communications technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the technological innovation program and the technological program relating to an innovative company, which are both of my competence.The new strategy defined by the Commission of the Tourism and Employment Commission and approved by the Council emphasizes the collection and dissemination of information in terms of tourism and good practices.The implementation of the statistics directive aims to improve knowledge of structures and trends in the European tourism market and the sector concerned.Commission's decisions have advanced the methodological approach.The report on experience acquired in the work accomplished under this directive is part of our work program for the current year.An additional work relating to the social and economic impact of tourism is currently underway in collaboration with international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization.The primary role of the European Community is to ensure a framework that enables the parties concerned and the authorities, at all levels, to optimize and concretize the potential of the tourism sector in terms of growth and employment and encourage them to do so.We will succeed in such a European strategy based on the commitment made by the Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, in particular through new technologies;training to improve skills;quality of tourism products and sustainable development in the tourism sector.In the fall, the Commission will report on the progress made in this regard.In about two years, a report on work to be undertaken jointly with the Member States and the tourism sector should be available.Depending on the results of this work, a broader debate could then be held which could well be the starting point for even more exhaustive political initiatives.Mr. Medina Ortega asked me a few very concrete questions.Regarding the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many political sectors have a huge impact on the structure of tourism.Specific, targeted tourist actions are not the only ones to import;There are also other horizontal actions in the transport sector.At present, congestion of airways and roads is the fundamental problem.In the field of the environment, we examine methods of cooperation with Ms. Wallström;In the field of regional policy, Mr. Barnier pays great attention to this sector.	fr
"As for this in itself the content of the map, I believe that the distribution of rights into three categories is apt. The map will include political rights directly related to European citizenship, such as the right to vote, the right to reference, the right to appeal to the mediator. Human Rights, that is, all rights protected by various international organizations and new rights (bioethics, personal data protection) and social rights: a right of minimum income, a right to strike, the right to unemployment benefit. I will conclude by stressing that this map should be perceived as a central part of a process, which should result in the European Union Constitution obtain!, in writing.(In) I would like to mention the reasons why I thought I had to abstain from the final vote, although as other Members I am categorically in favor of protecting fundamental freedoms and rights, as well as ensuring that future social developments can be taken into account. Already, within the European Union, Member States have ratified and transferred to their legal systems the European Convention on Human Rights which, although a document of almost 50 years, has been shown to be adjusted according to changing conditions and expanded with new rights. I believe that what is now proposed with this ""map"" will eventually lead to an interpretative conflict on rights based on different documents, which could create a legal gap and, which is an irony, to reduce the rights provided. We need more time and discussion of these possible conflicts. At the Cologne Summit it was decided that a map of EU fundamental rights must be drawn up. The map must include and register the rights in the Treaty and make them clearer and more known. We welcome this map of fundamental rights, which may also include rights in existing international conventions signed by Member States. At the same time, human rights must be considered an international and general affair and not just a matter of EU citizens. However, we have some doubts about whether this map must be legally binding, unless it is first clear what its consequences will be. The relationship between the Court of Justice of the European Communities and the European Court of Human Rights seems to be complicated in a legal point of view and could undermine the European Convention on Human Rights. We believe that there are a number of issues that need to be considered before we end up with a model. We therefore abstain from the final vote., in writing.(DA) The five members of the Left of the European Parliament, Bertel Haarder, Anne E. Jensen, Ole Andreasen and Niels Busk, voted today against point 14A of the report because we want the map to remain out of the intergovernmental conference.(Ppe-de), in writing.(In) This report confirms our worst fears of the intentions of some in the map and we have voted against it. We do not vote against this map itself, but so far the process seems to indicate that we have not taken the opportunity to protect Europe's citizens from the oppressive power of the European institutions."	el
Today, in many states, this is not possible.One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between European space and, for example, the United States is precisely this ability to bounce back on the other side of the ocean and that we do not know.I believe that, since we have gone as far as that and that we will continue in this path, which is the way to create a collective procedure for regulating this type of uniform litigation in the European Union, we must think of what it does not become the allegorical figure of guillotine.Mr. President, my dear friends, Mr. Commissioner, I believe that if we have so far avoided a certain number of disasters which could have occurred in the absence of the rules that the previous speaker has just mentioned, we owe it more to our skill.When we deal with the internal market, we must worry not only on the most positive side of the project, that is to say the construction of the internal market itself, but also of its reverse, namely bankruptcies.I consider that we live a historic moment.I congratulate the rapporteur for having advanced this work with such a diligence.And moreover, I am proud that my country of origin participated in the development of this provision, which we hope will be quickly adopted by the Council.I think we are preparing to take an important step here, even if its impact on national systems is not very sensitive.Unfortunately, I must inform the rapporteur that our group will not be able to support the amendment proposal 3. We believe that it would have a negative effect on the legal position and protection of citizens.Regarding amendment 6, we presented a similar proposal during the debates in committee, and I am surprised enough that the members of the PSE group did not support it.We intend to vote in favor of this amendment 6 proposal, but I repeat, I wonder why you did not approve the text we had presented in committee.I hope also that we will obtain transparency in this context, as well as a comparison which makes it possible to determine which will be, for our different countries, the best and fastest procedures.Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, firstly, the Commission would like to emphasize that the proposal for an examination on the exam tonight constitutes only and above all a new formulation of the 1995 insolvency procedure. Everyone knows that the convention in question has been the fruit of long years of debate, often difficult, often laborious and that, in this way, it represents a compromise between the principles of unity and territorialityBetween the structuring principles of various legal systems of bankruptcy in each of our Member States.The fact that we are aware that the evolution of the global economic situation and, above all, of the internal market, can demand the more frequent recourse to bankruptcy procedures, which often put on the nature of cross -border procedures, fully justifies that the Union, as such, has the necessary legal instruments necessary in order to guarantee that the insolvency procedure is executed according to a set of common structuring principles andof rapid execution.	fr
"These two countries are also eligible for financial support under the Meda program (B7-4012).During its first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new title ""pre-prédhesion"" (B7-0) proposed by the Commission in the pre-draft budget should not be limited to the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, it should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.However, due to the Refusal of the Council to negotiate the necessary revision of the ceiling fixed in section 7 (pre -prédhesion) of financial prospects, the European Parliament accepted, exceptionally, I insist on this fact, to finance these expenses within the framework of section 4 (external shares) of financial prospects for the year 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament has created a new chapter relating to the ""strategy ofPreadhesion for Mediterranean countries ""(B7-04).Inside this chapter, two new articles concerning the pre -prédhesion strategy for Malta and Cyprus were created, and this awaiting the presentation by the Helsinki European Council - the necessary legal bases, as well as the revision of the ceiling of section 7 of the financial prospects.This settlement proposal should constitute one of these legal bases!I welcome the report of Mr. Brok who supports, for a few amendments, the commission's proposals to prepare the membership of Cyprus and Malta for the EU.The package will grant around a total of 15 million euros for both countries during this year.However, it is regrettable that the Commission has favored an annual allocation of funds to multi -year financing.This decision risks having repercussions on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan their expenses.Funding will ensure technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of community acquis.Given their advance compared to other candidates, these countries should not encounter any technical and administrative difficulty for membership of the five -year program.Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000).As a member of the Economic and Monetary Commission under the previous legislature, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision to strengthen the protection of our single currency.The Union must implement all the means at its disposal to guarantee its protection against falsification.Indeed, consumers, traders, are not really familiar with the Euro.Memal currency can therefore quite easily be put into circulation in supermarkets, in exchange offices and in banks, without being immediately noticed.As for the coins, the fact that they may have a national side will make them even more difficult to identify.Information centers on Europe, which already play a key role in awareness of citizens with single currency, will have to strengthen the countryside aimed at attracting the attention of the public to the false monk.On another scale, it will be necessary to guarantee cooperation between community institutions and national institutions and set up an information system allowing the collection and exchange of data concerning false monitoring.On the criminal level, measures capable of guaranteeing a game protection of the euro are also necessary.It is in this context that the European Parliament presented the draft decision-making aimed at strengthening the criminal framework for the protection against false monetary."	fr
However, these values ​​are only of full importance if they are part of the contract in a comprehensible detail and ultimately also constitutes legal claims for the individual citizens.Article 6 and 7 of the contract are not enough in the event of the case.In this sense, the Commission - and I would like to confirm and encourage this - to insist on the fact that the newly to be worked out fundamental rights chart becomes part of the contract and creates binding and enforceable rights.In this sense, the Commission must insist on the continuous expansion of the common space of freedom, security and law, and in this sense I contradict my two previous speakers.Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law must be countered by the extreme rights of the irrational, seductive and demagogical claims of the right.But, and I would like to underline that, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy of employment and against social exclusion, because unemployment, marginalization and growing inequality are an optimal breeding ground for anti -European, nationalistic feeling and acting.In this context, Mr President, I would also like to consider the globalization that you have problematized and its perception through large parts of the population.The feeling of being delivered, the lack of influence and the lack of protection by the state in the best case leads to the avert of politics and to vote, as in European elections, and, in the worst case, to extremist election behavior.Here, like everyone, the Union has not yet understood to offer our citizens of the EU as a means, as a protection against the negative effects of globalization.We are in the process of building a house, but too few of our own citizens also feel at home in this house.Therefore, it is not just a reform of the world trade organization and the economic architecture - and the commission president has clearly forgotten to speak of the reform of the financial institutions of the international financial architecture - but also about trust -building measures for our citizens who are right from the EU and in the EU help and support in the inevitable but painful processes of adaptation to the new global conditions.In this context, it is important what the Commission says about the strengthening voice of Europe.You, Mr. President, spoke of a model that I unfortunately find too little in the document about;They said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, which is clearly different from other models, also from the American model.In this sense, the United States is not only our partners, but also our competitors, not opponents, but competitors, and we have to fight who offers the best model for our citizens.I would like what we said today with this clear vehemence that we also find increasingly in the documents of the Commission.President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy that its Commission could leave the European Union would be an active contribution to redesigning and redistribution of the increasingly confused and confusing powers and skills of the Commission and possibly the Union itself.	de
It undoubtedly begins a discussion with both Parliament and the Council on this state of affairs, which shows that there are quite a few differences in the excise taxes of the Member States. For example, - I think a dug -in a member referred to this - in France, there is no excise tax in France, while in the UK it is charged. This leads to distortion of the internal market by smuggling wine from France to the United Kingdom. The question is, in particular, the relationship between the alcohol content of excise duty and excise taxes. The Commission has no means of influence on this. In the case of Sweden, the purpose of excise duties is indeed to reduce alcohol consumption. Although this leads to the mismatch between Swedish and other Member States of the Union - and in turn increases smuggling alcohol products beyond borders - it is a legitimate tool to reduce alcohol consumption. Demand is obviously varied and affects prices. I'm not entirely sure how much it is, but it is not zero, so it must have some effect. I would have asked almost the same question as a member Purvis, but I would like to emphasize this view even more. Although excise taxes are, as you said, the use of that unique rights in a way that is unfairly discriminations in some community producers for others, there may in any case be in conflict with the principle of uniform markets. For example, if we take what a member Purvis and I think, that is, malt whiskey -producing areas in the Scottish highlands -a very cramped periphery of Europe, where the entire farmer community and the distillation industry are dependent on the production of malt whiskey -the common practice in the Scottish whiskey, the Dutch or Danish Academic AkvitisAlcohol, in my opinion, is discriminatory and discriminating against the undeniable rights of the Member States. I would like to convince a member Maccormick and other members of the Parliament that the current situation in which excise duties are different in different Member States do not really promote proper activities in the internal market. We do not need to be limited to alcohol products. For example, if we look at gasoline, we find that German excise tax is different from the Netherlands tax, and thus, Dutch motorists cross the border and fill their tanks in Germany. This really distorts the internal market. If I could decide, I would swing the magic wand and the most united excise tax throughout Europe. In this case, smuggling would no longer occur, unless the products were more expensive in one Member State than in another. However, I do not have a magic wand and I can't decide. As Member MacCormick knows, this is a matter of consensus, and unless all Member States agree to unify the excise duty, it cannot be done. Once again, I would say that the Commission will give a statement on the subject matter of excise duties towards the end of this year, and I am of course ready to discuss it with Parliament. Much thanks, the Member of the Commission. Today, we are in danger of your words and trying to drink a glass - or maybe two - ElSian wines, whose tax is not known, even though I assume that it is charged a high tax. As the time reserved for the Commission Question Time has passed, questions 55-114 will be answered in writing. I declare the Commission's Question Hours.(The session was suspended at 7:30 pm and continued at 9:00 pm) Community water policy (continuation) on the agenda will follow the next follow -up to another discussion on the water policy of the Community. Mr President, the situation of sweet waters in Europe is not as serious as the rest of the world, but in general, it is clear that demand for water has not ceased to grow and the quality of decline. This should further add water pollution problems, which are affecting possible new Eastern European Member States. By the way, in Romania, a cyanide pool was broken, which threatens to cause damage to the groundwater on which the population of Yugoslav is dependent. I understand Wallström, whose presence I am very grateful tonight, is going to visit that area.	fi
Similarly, we consider it impossible to fight against racism, anti -Semitism or xenophobia without naturalizing people, that is, without cutting them, at least politically, from their private backgrounds, that is, from their ethnicities, or from what we today call the minorities,Justice and domestic affairs, but also in our own policy, as in the one we followed in Kosovo, which in our opinion is extremely dangerous. By restoring ethnicities, by restoring minorities, we are dangerously paving the way to particular origins against political backgrounds that are national backgrounds and this Pandora's box will not soon end up in the ignition of our continent. For this reason, it is ridiculous in our opinion to boast of human rights in a region that in the long run exposes us to the worst retreats in the long run. Mr President, Honorable colleagues, I read the Ludford exhibition with great interest and I would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her observations on Austria and the Austrian situation. But I must emphasize that these observations do not concern a human rights report. When we have a discussion about Austria, when we process a document on the Austrian situation - if this parliament considers it necessary - we will also be able to entrust Ludford the task of writing a document that we will all discuss together. These observations do not concern the human rights document, as it does not concern the time margin given to the Ludford Baroness report, which gives them the bitter taste of political expediency on a very serious issue such as human rights. A second observation I would like to make about this report concerns the right of Europeans to have an identity. Throughout the text, the identity of the European, European nations, is not once mentioned in a positive way: always as a possible matrix of xenophobia and racism. I am a religious man, convinced of my religion: Is this a reason to be considered a suspected xenophobia? We would say that the degeneration of religious feeling can probably lead to xenophobia. This religion itself is a factor that brings people. I am a convinced Italian patriot: According to the paragraph of this document, I am a suspect of xenophobia. It seems to me that this betrays a cultural behavior that promotes xenophobia, because it promotes the fear of globalization, which pushes so many local communities to close themselves and to deny dialogue, a dialogue on identity. We must declare that there is a European cultural identity, based on the Greek heritage, the Judaic-Christian heritage and the Enlightenment, which is freely chosen by other identities. A multicultural Europe that would be absent from European culture would be the beginning of the destruction and disintegration of culture. This is not a white culture: culture has no colors.	el
The fundamental discussion point with the Council will obviously be the endowment which Life III must be provided.The common position provides for a financial envelope of 613 million euros for the period 2000-2004, it is insufficient.The Liberal group is favorable to the increase in this amount to 850 million euros.We therefore support the amendment of Ms. Lienemann who notes that the endowment of Life was not increased during the last enlargement of the Union, not to mention the next train of new arrivals.The sums we ask for do not constitute by a Himalayas of unnecessary expenses.On the contrary, they are still very modest in relation to the needs to be covered.A drop of water - I would say - compared to the structural policies of Europe.The environment remains a very poor parent of the European budget, even though it constitutes above all an investment.Investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been shown that an active environment policy created new workstations, for proof in particular the very great success of LIFE: success with NGOs, companies, local authorities, third countries.Nearly a third of the 8,500 requests received met the required conditions and approximately 1,300 projects could be co -financed between 1992 and 1998. A success that Parliament wants to see, intends to see permanent, which is why we also support the amendment 14 sketching the fourth stage of life of the Life project.When it comes to environment, investment and ambition are available, must be available in the long term.The future of future generations is at this price.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, I will probably repeat what my colleagues are said but I believe that, for advice, it is still and still repeating what we think of Life.So, I would also say - as the rapporteur has already done very well - that Life is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation and implementation of the European Union policy.This system is absolutely essential because it promotes truly innovative actions in favor of nature and the environment in Europe, which are taken up and amplified by the Member States.This financial instrument is, moreover, voluntarily democratic by being accessible both to government organizations as to NGOs.It is why, dear colleagues, that I will ask you not to vote the amendments that have understood nothing in the spirit of Life.Indeed, through associations, Life is directly usable by the European citizen, and for the benefit of actions of general interest.Several million - I have said millions - of NGO members recognize in Life the will of the Union to build an ambitious policy in favor of the natural heritage.Life is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe for which the Member States have invested, in accordance with the community guidelines on rare and threatened flora and fauna habitats and on migratory birds, and which allows the implementation of the protection of high -value biological sites in our states.	fr
We have to make sure to give meaning to what we do.We must not create confusion or arouse conflicts of jurisdiction about rights, which would be highly harmful to freedom, justice and security.In short, we must set up and observe the highest possible standards possible, and find the means to save them.But we must also always have subsidiarity to the mind.Like everyone in this assembly, I aspire to this space of freedom, justice and security, but I do not want it to lead to excessive centralization, chaos and confusion.Madam President, honorable deputies, several questions were asked about the Portuguese presidency in previous interventions.The President of the Parliament made us feel that we did not have a lot of time, which is why we propose, my colleague of justice and myself, to answer objectively to all the questions that have been asked here.We will do this on the occasion of the meeting of the parliamentary committee in which we will participate next week.(Extended applause) Thank you very much, Minister.The debate is closed.Mr. President, I am delighted with the oral and written response of the Council.Its effectiveness has really been remarkable.I spare a few seconds because I would like to propose to the Council to continue to debate at the next meeting of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs.We will have the opportunity to comment on these proposals as well as to express our concerns with the Commission.I personally congratulate myself on some of the answers received, for example, those concerning subjects as sensitive as Schengen or the Europol Convention which, we hope, will be reviewed and I am delighted with what the Minister of Justice said, namely that we will try to submit to the jurisdiction of the judiciary.I hope it will be the same with regard to parliamentary control.Gentlemen representatives of the Council, we will submit to this assembly, in a month, a proposal for a resolution.I am sure that, with the good humor that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of mutual agreement, will be to take into account the proposal for resolution that we will submit to you.Question time (advice) The agenda calls the time for questions to the Council (B5-0003/2000).Question No1 of (H-0780/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in a region of Turkey with strong seismicity The two earthquakes, of a magnitude greater than 7 on the Richter scale, recently occurred in Turkey arouse the most lively concerns before the will displayed by Turkey to build costly nuclear reactors in Akuyu, while even the excessive energy.The Ataturk dams are exported to third countries and which the EU takes its own resources to contribute to the repair of the damage caused by earthquakes.We are led to think that the Turkish nuclear program, which ignores the dangers incurred by the inhabitants and the ecosystems of the country and the whole of the region, serves as a facade for a strategy arrested by the political authorities of Turkey to acquire the nuclear technology which will allow them to acquire nuclear weapons, insofar as they seek to acquire the same reactors, whichPakistan.	fr
Visit the delegation just before the entry into force of the Association Agreement between the Morocco and the European Union 1. March 2000 is a tribute to us. At this historical moment, we are positive about the development and opportunities of our relationships to summarize the cooperation between our parliaments. In this spirit, the delegation responsible for Maghreb's countries will visit Morocco on 20.22. March. I hope the delegation's visit to Strasbourg is excellent. (Strong popularity) Mr President, I just would like to use the delegation welcoming wishes to inform you that it is also a pleasure for us to have the most important responsibilities of Austrian anti -racist associations in Parliament. (The session was suspended at 11:50 am because the Parliament held a celebration of the Czech Republic of the Czech Republic's Vaclav Havel's visit, and the session continued at 12.50 pm (Parliament approved the resolution.) Recommendation for another processing: The recommendation of the Environmental Affairs, the Public Health and Consumer Policy Committee for Second Handling (A5-0027/2000) From the Common Stock of the Council to provide/work the European Parliament and of the Council Directive and to the development of water policy (9085/3/1999 C5-02091997/0067 (COD)) (Rapporteur: Lieneemann) Before the vote: - (FR) I give my recognition to a high quality and ambitious report on Life. I would briefly remind me that Life is an environmental financial instrument that can be used to pursue environmental policy in both the European Union and in third countries, whether it be Mediterranean countries, the Baltic Sea countries or the applicant states. The Committee on Environmental Health, Public Health and Consumer Policy has submitted a number of amendments, most of which were approved by the Council's joint position. The third phase of the LIFE funding tool (2000-2004) is divided into three areas, which include LIFE (47 % of the funds), LIFE environment (47 % of funds) and Life-third (6 % of funds). The most important changes in the LIFE tool are, in my opinion, that the LIFE tool promotes sustainable development and the development of community environmental policy, especially when it comes to incorporating environmental issues in other areas of policy and implementing and re-enforcing environmental legislation;Improving the efficiency, transparency and methods of cooperation between the procedures for the application of the LIFE, the procedures for information and the sharing of information to the public, and the cooperation between supporters;The objective of the LIFE tool, which is mainly sustainable in urban areas, in cooperation with the Urban initiative-which I had the opportunity to express my opinion with the pilot projects in connection with my opinion;The fact that projects can promote socioeconomic activities related to sustainable development and thus support the creation of jobs. I think it would be important that the Central and Eastern European applicant countries can continue to participate in the LIFE. Other applicant states (e.g. Cyprus, Turkey and Malta) could participate in the LIFE device once the contracts enabled with them were made with them. Of course, the stumbling block for negotiations with the Council is still the total amount of funding for the third phase of the LIFE program (2000-2004). The Commission's proposal to the Finance of the Council is EUR 613 million, while the Environmental Affairs Committee believes that the budget should be EUR 850 million. For my part, I support my rapporteur's determination. In fact, financial appropriations have not been customized since the program was created, not even when the European Community expanded to consist of 15 Member States. If the report is approved at the plenary session, the conciliation procedure required for the joint decision procedure must be initiated in order to decide on the amount of the appropriations for the program. The mediation procedure is a very common practice, as too often it happens that the budget for legislative programs or actions is not enough to achieve the goals! Bögen report (A5-0023/2000). (FR) As a member of the European Parliament, and especially as a citizen and consumer, I have a positive view of the proposal of the European Commission, which in the European Union means one step in the direction of better food safety. This proposal is two-leaning: on the one hand, it is about changing the health of the Council's animal health directive by removing Skrape regulations and, on the other hand, implementing a new regulation that sets up and control of certain infectious sponged encephalopathies (TSE) or other animal species.	fi
Now, however, it seems obvious, the President that if we start a discussion based on Article 50 of the Rules of Procedure, which you and the Presidential Assembly have requested to start, it means that we are scary to damage the principle of free and independent states and democratic elected governments. This may happen that tomorrow we will have a majority of Parliament again, who considers it to be entitled to intervene in another Member State in the line -up of the government elected in another Member State, calmly fluent and democratic elections. If you give a blessing ... a member of Gollnisch, I'm sorry, but the minute of your speech was already full. I know that you are always careful that the rules of procedure will be followed. Dear President, I thought I had three minutes of talk time. Excuse. If you give a blessing to such a development, you will also give your blessings to the development of the Union as an institution that violates the right to independence and freedom of Member States, where our only option would be to resign from such a union. We have now heard both the speaker and the speaker who opposed it. Thus, we move on to the agenda of the agenda for the change.(Parliament approved the proposal.) The debate will be marked at the beginning of the agenda. The discussion on important, current and urgent issues on the agenda is the following discussion on important, current and urgent topics. The Austrian government negotiations on the agenda are the following debate on the Austrian government negotiations. I am now giving a speech to the chairman of the Council. Mr President, Mr President of the Commission, Mr President of the Council, a group of the European Social Democratic Party now wants to send three messages to European citizens. Let's make it clear that we are completely unanimously behind all these messages. First of all, we want to express our profit and agree to the statement of the chairman of the Council and 14 Member States, because we believe that this statement corresponds to the value of the value of which we all together, not just one political force, have built. Nonetheless, this is a community of values ​​that opposes the ideas of this party, called sarcastically the Austrian Freedom Party. The Europe we build originated specifically from bitter events that everyone has experienced, and the Socialist Group condemns the insults that have been pronounced to the President of the French Republic and the Belgian Government, but also to the Socialists, who are also European citizens, good parliamentary members, Austria Socialists. I tell you one thing: I've been a traitor for many years, or at least General Franco said so. Prime Minister Guterres also cracked Salazar, and I think the PPE group should also admit this issue and also give it its support. Chairman Prodi, and I also think the Commission has served as the supervisor of the establishment agreements. However, I remind the chairman that the Commission spoke like a European government in the context of a debate on the debate. The government must work more vigorously and boldly. This is what I am now asking for the chairman Prod.(Applause) Most respectfully, a very effective Commission member of Fischler, because there have been conflicting information in different languages ​​that the chairman Prodi would have asked to resign Fischler, I would be very grateful if you could deal with this to the Parliament. Secondly, the Mr President, we want to send a very clear message to the people of Austria. This is a petition to the majority of Austrian citizens who did not vote for Haider, who clearly voted for democratic alternatives to which Europe is also committed to - and I have to say that if Schüssel was Minister of Finance, then Chancellor Vranitzky was supported by Austria. In politics, you cannot divide so sharply into different camps. We all contributed to Austria's joining the community. It was everyone and not just one group. Thus, the Mr President, I think our rights and duty are to ask the Austrians to consider again and carefully, because such a plague we have already suffered in Europe, not only harm Austria, but may also spread, and I say this in history.	fi
I am looking forward to the draft for a compromise closure, which we have agreed together with the factions of the GUE, the Greens, the Liberals and the PSE, and in which we ask the Commission to present the parliament to the parliament within six months about the realizability of this tax and also have financial compulsory measures and sanctions against the countries that favor tax paradise or to entertain or maintain control paradise within six months.Check, because the objection is often made, such a tax would be avoided, but this applies to every tax, and if you follow this argument, there would be no taxes today.In addition, the draft decision demands that a position paper by the Commission and the Council should be developed by the IMF's next annual meeting.In my opinion, the European Union must take the initiative here;Furthermore, it must suggest this initiative, as is required in the draft decision, the G7 countries, since it is primarily a political question.If the Union takes the initiative, this would have a certain impulse effect because this debate takes place everywhere, also in the United States and in Japan, and because worldwide efforts are increasingly being felt that express the desire that the world should not be directed by stock exchange brokers, but by the citizens, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.In my opinion, Europe must perform its tasks as part of this new international regulation, and I am extremely happy that this question is on the agenda of the European structure today in this debate and with this draft decision.Mrs. President!I don't have much to notice in advance on this topic.The Council has not yet dealt with the introduction of a tax for capital movements proposed by Professor Tobin.This is a creative initiative that, as we know, has encountered approval in various sectors worldwide and with several European political groups, but so far there is no proposal and no initiative on this question.Since the Commission is responsible for a possible initiative, the Council can only comment on this topic..(NL) Mrs. President!The Tobin tax is to be collected on income from very short-term foreign exchange transactions.Such transactions, it is argued, would hardly have a reference to the real economy data.This was also emphasized by Mr. Désir.Proponents like Mr. Désir are therefore of the opinion that an internationally introduced tobin tax would in principle contribute to the containment of speculative currency transactions and thus also the price fluctuations, which meant a higher economic assets.Due to the considerable scope of short-term capital movements, even with a very low nominal tobin tax, the tax revenue would be significant.The growing interest in Tobin tax and other international financial sources in the mid-1990s were actually under the basis of non-economic motifs, namely the income to be achieved by this tax on the financing of international public programs at a time when the demand for such funding was increasingly increasing and capital was becoming increasingly difficult.The Commission recently found another interest in a global tax such as the Tobin tax, which is intended to serve to achieve socially acceptable globalization, so to speak.	de
In other words, this is not a harmonization, but of common goals. It is an undisputed fact that EU Member States have different methods of organizing their social policy. We are from different traditions, there are differences in culture and, despite the numerous common points, there are also big differences in the character of social problems as well as in their country from country to country. Consequently, it is important to emphasize that social policy is a national affair. National Policy, of course, belongs to a series of common frameworks, first, the minimum rights set by the Treaty, secondly, to ensure the mobility of the workforce without the loss of social rights, thirdly, to ensure coordination of Member States' economies and, fourth, economies. That is, coordination and cooperation is needed. Convergence, however, must be in the goals and not in the media. I would also like to thank the rapporteur of the exhibition, Mr. Jan Andersson, for his such constructive effort and his concern to reconcile the various positions and secure support for his report. I am able to support the report, but there are individual points that I do not approve a hundred percent. I do not agree with the requirement that the Commission intervene in what is called unjust competition between social and tax systems, if such an intervention is used to obstruct the revision, evolution and effectiveness of our social systems or to prevent the reduction in excessively high tax burdens. The committee's involvement with the extent and quality of child care and care services of the elderly. I am thinking about the value of a common poverty threshold. The coordination of social policy and the dialogue is good, but we should not put everyone in a cauldron. There must be room for a variety of solutions. Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, I would like to set a series of points, other positive and other controversial, regarding the strategy on the modernization of social security. I find it positive in the direction that is slowly but steadily shaped, on this issue and which seems useful to me. I also positively face the basics of the announcement on the strategic approach. We hope, however, the four goals mentioned here will be able to implement. In addition, we would like to point out how important the way this issue must be addressed, on the one hand with the Luxembourg type process, that is, with guidelines. But we also believe that it is very important, as Mrs Van Lancker has previously argued, to have instructions, e.g. In terms of informal forms of work, freelancers without staff, etc., however, we predict the existence of two problems, which should be pursued solutions. The first concerns the derivative adaptations of social security, for which we hope that there will be a level of convergence. I will mention some examples of a recent survey by Dutch trade union movements on reforms in the European Union in terms of social security.	el
First, the parliament must have unhindered access to all commission documents.On the other hand, we have to quickly find a regulation internally to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive documents.In connection with the procurement of information, I would like to draw the commission aware that the plans available in the draft will provide us with documents.If the concept is correct, it represents an enormous step backwards.It is also not the case that a public institution has a copyright of public documents.In addition, the tasks of all European civil servants must generally be determined so that an official can defend themselves more easily against orders for conscience, which run the ethical principles or legal provisions.If the Court of Auditors signals that a problem does not occur, but two years in a row, the management must be held responsible, which must also be felt in its career planning.After all, of course, better cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts is also required.The parliament calls for the Commission to broadly explain their plans for a reform of their programs for foreign assistance on March 31 of this year.It is no longer acceptable that Europe is an economic power, but we cannot have a political influence, because when it comes to it, we are unable to offer effective support.We cannot accept that the Commission completed a hospital in 1996, in which not a single patient is available to this day.The relief has gained political importance since 1996.It is one of the strongest power instruments that Parliament has and must therefore be used.In all likelihood, we will therefore grant relief tomorrow.However, we do not give up this weapon without putting a time bomb.The relief is only granted for 1999 when the financial irregularities complained by the Court of Auditors have been clarified.This report on relief is of course directed to the Commission.But still the European Parliament has to create order internally.As long as we do not have a statute, we are unbelievable as an engine for the reform package of the Union.The reform of the EU institutions is a basic requirement for the further development of Europe.Only an open and democratic Europe can be powerful and fair.All organs now have to go to work together to create this Europe.Mr. President, the committee for industry, foreign trade, research and energy, has decided to start and create a report on relief for the 1997 financial year, even if we had no specific mandate.We did that because we thought we should start in this parliament as we continue to proceed in the future by ensuring that the European taxpayers are in good hands with us.During the creation of this report, it turned out that there are serious problems in the spending areas that belong to our household.	de
"It therefore seemed essential to fill this gap to reach a high and uniform level of training for security advisers, but also to avoid a disparity between training costs and, consequently, an impact on competition between companies in the Member States.The commission's proposal aims to provide uniform training for security advisers.It delimits the minimal content of exams and defines the tasks of the competent authority as well as the requirements to be fulfilled by examining instances.Our parliament has been favorable to this text.He nevertheless presented several amendments, most of which have been retained in the common position of the Council, in particular with regard to the need to draw up a questionnaire and declarations concerning the authorization of certain documents within the framework ""of the specifications of the examination methods proposed by the examination organization"".I also support the postponement of the date of application of these provisions to three months after the entry into force of the directive for the sake of realism.I will conclude by emphasizing the fact that harmonization of the professional qualification of these advisers will help improve the quality of service in the interest of users, to minimize the risk of accidents that can lead to environmental deterioration as well as serious damage likely to undermine the physical integrity of anyone who can come into contact with dangerous goods.Koch report (A5-0104/1999) I expressed myself last October on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by railway.The words that I will make today are not far from those I made at the time.They come down to this: I regret that, in an area as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we always put back in the next day the adoption of harmonized standards to the detriment of the safety of men and the environment.I will recall that a directive on the reconciliation of the laws of the Member States concerning the transport of dangerous goods by road entered into force on January 1, 1997. This included a certain number of transitional provisions valid until January 1, 1999. It was from this date that we should have pronounced on a proposal from the European Commission aimed at ceasing these derogations.According to the procedure in use, it is the European Standardization Committee (CEN) which proposes the standards in this field, which are then registered in the European agreement relating to the international transport of dangerous goods by road signed in Geneva in 1957 (better known as ADR acronym), which applies throughout Europe and whose provisions serve as the basis for the law applicable in the EU.The CEN has not been able to carry out its work in the allotted time.Consequently, the proposal of the commission that we discuss today aims to modify the directive to solve these short -term problems and not to put an end to the transitional regime as should be the case!This is exactly what happened for the transport of these goods by railway, with this difference: a period had been arrested."	fr
"In this case, the Commission proposes to obtain concrete information from the Irish authorities about the current state of compensation measures and to potential problems in connection with the mechanical elimination of savings grass.We do not consider it appropriate to suggest a suspension of the financing as part of the structural funds.Mr. President, the case mentioned by Ms. McKenna is unfortunately not an isolated case.There are other examples of how EU funds are used in such a way that they have a negative impact on the protected areas set up for scientific reasons.The Commission can imagine that all Member States identify that in cases in which they determine a violation of European environmental guidelines or an incorrect implementation of environmental exams, the ongoing financing is not only exposed, but also replaced by funds, or, in other words, the funds are reclaimed by the Member States.This is the only way to stop such actions in the future..(SV) This is an extremely important question.As you are known to you as a member of the European Parliament, a joint letter from our predecessors in the Commission, rode Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies, was written last year, which dealt with the relationship between structural funds, funds from the structural funds and protection according to the Florafaunahabiti Directive.The message of this joint letter is still valid.We cannot distribute money with one hand and bring the countries with the other, where they may be fined.That is why it is important that there is a agreement here.Of course, difficult matters can occur.In my opinion, however, the most important effect is that the countries are superior and, above all, submit their lists of the fields for Natura 2000, so that we have the possibility of sensible surveillance and control.In this regard, there are still defects in Ireland, as with other Member States, but we hope that this pressure will soon show results.Let me underline again that the content of the above.Letter is still valid.It is not possible according to the rules of procedure.You have to speak outside the plenary hall, Ms. MP.Inquiries to Mr. Barnier Inquiry No. 44 of (H-0020/00): concerns: partnership-based relationship and the third GREED for Greece The new regulation 1260/1999 About the Structural Association places special emphasis on the strengthening of the partnership-based relationship and sees the participation of the autonomous self-administration at the level of the regions and municipalities as well as the other responsible stateAuthorities, the social partners and any other relevant responsible provider not only in preparation, but also in the financing, monitoring and evaluation of the interventions.The procedures for the new GRP Greece are, however, the repeated complaints of bodies of municipal self -government, but remained unchanged and do not bring anything for the role of ""partners"".Has the Greek state caused a change in the procedures so that the partnership -based relationship is expanded in particular to the local authorities and other representative committees?What does the improved role of the local authorities look like in the preparation and management of the third GfK and what measures did the commission take to ensure more ""partners"" participation in all procedures as part of the new GfK?"	de
"It is unacceptable after fifty years of European construction that European citizens are not equal to the law merely because of the game for residents and non -residents. The concept of citizenship is therefore a common good, for which we need to overcome failures such as that of Helsinki. I would like to ask you three specific questions: First Question: Do you predict that the mechanism you propose can come into force, taking into account the completion of the financial markets and their necessary tax regulation? Second question: In terms of environmental taxation, the mechanism you propose provides for the special majority? Third Question: The mechanism you propose will enable the Council to put an end, by a special majority, in the tax havens that exist within the European Union? Thanks, Mr. Commissioner, for your statement. I am sure that none of us here will be opposed to dealing with fraud and tax evasion. But I have to say that it is necessary to maintain the confidence of the citizens in the Union, and I think that the governments of many Member States before they agree on any extension of the voting with a special majority will want to consider the matter very carefully. This really hurts the quintessence of what is perceived as the ability of a state to regulate its national affairs. I am particularly referring to some issues such as the source tax withholding, which would be unacceptable to be subject to a special majority vote. I hope you consider these issues when you look at the practical aspects of approval of the measures package. We express our great satisfaction in combating fraud and tax evasion and improving social security legislation, but there are some issues where we will find it difficult to persuade all Member States to follow. Mr. Commissioner, I have some very simple questions for you, for each of which just needs a ""yes"" or ""no"" answer. Can you guarantee that the Commission will not seek, under any circumstances, use the vote by a special majority to impose a source tax withholding? Can you provide the same guarantees in terms of the proposed aircraft fuel tax discussed at the ECOFIN Council this week and can you provide the same guarantees with regard to companies in the European Union? Are there any conditions under which the Commission would try to use the vote by a special majority for any of these issues? Can you guarantee that the Commission will not use the vote by a special majority for any of the above issues? Mr President, I can imagine that, according to some of my colleagues, citizens are sensitive to European intervention in tax and social affairs. I can tell you that in my country too many citizens react to the fact that Europe does nothing in social and tax affairs, despite their unanimous desire. So I would like to ask two specific questions to the Commissioner. The first is mainly concerned with citizens, who are strongly interested in non -intervention in these areas, and especially those who want to enjoy the free movement of persons, and in particular cross -border workers."	el
"Colleagues, the nice words are no longer enough. We have to determine a new course. According to tomorrow's vote, we can make it clear that Europe is struggling in favor of a responsible and long -term policy on water resources. This will undoubtedly increase our credibility. The discussion is interrupted and will continue at 9pm. Dialogue on Europe: Institutional reform The agenda then foresees the Commission's announcement on: Dialogue on Europe - Institutional Reform. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, the Commission is even currently discussing the committee, and her work is almost certain that they will not be completed today. I will therefore talk to you, as you have been informed by Parliament's agenda, for a new initiative proposed by the Commission as a response, which is certainly not the only answer, to a major challenge that must mobilize all the agents of European construction, as well as the leaders of the European Council, as well as the Council. Parliament, and I will also add the employees working in our various institutions and who are militant and active for this European building. In the long discussion, which I attended this morning with President Prodi, many of you referred to the democratic deficit and the removal of European institutions. By saying this is not just my question to ask who is doing what - a member of you has raised it with great clearness and boldness. Who does what among our different institutions is the least that citizens understand. The question we are asked to answer immediately is what we all do together and what we want to do in the future, especially with the countries that are going to join the Union. Therefore, we are also called upon to deal with this democratic deficit, and that is why the next day the start of the intergovernmental conference immediately, during which I will have the honor of representing the Commission next to Mr Prodi, employee, I repeat, in a close relationship with them. Brok and Tsatsu, we decided to launch a ""dialogue in favor of Europe and for Europe"" shortly, playing our role in this direct contact with citizens. All the commissioners were committed every time they go to a country, and not just to their country of origin, to a district - I personally make such visits three to four times a month - to devote some time to their program for a direct dialogue with their citizens, notMeetings, but also have direct contacts, in a university, in a high school, in a factory, communicating with people, answering the questions and listening. So we will participate, as you will, in this necessary effort, participate in this imperative obligation that consists of limiting the democratic deficit, that is, the distance of citizens from what we do. We want to implement this initiative in cooperation with the Member States and jointly with the European Parliament. We will regularly draw conclusions so that the state of public opinion is properly weighing and we can make adjustments or reorientations."	el
Madam MP, I ask you all - do not take it as a warning - to approach only strictly community subjects.I know that these are very important subjects in Spain and there are several points of view ... I tell the commissioner thatznar is the president of the Spanish government.You can answer the question.Madam MP, as I heard that you had voice, I hope your voice was strong enough for it to be heard in Madrid, but I understood that what you said was not addressed directly to me.I gave you my answer.I am concerned that the structural funds, and in particular those of objective 1, are allocated where there is a need.We have criteria that apply and we know here, as an indication, what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.The fact remains - I do not shelter myself, but I am obliged to always refer to the general regulations - which I must discuss with the national authorities of each country and with the government of each country.It is their responsibility to distribute the most objectively and as precisely as possible.I need to know anyway, that's why I told you that I couldn't answer today.As I do not have the answer, I wrote to the Minister of Economy and Finance on December 14.Here, the time comes when I will get impatient for not having received an answer and I will send it to you when I received it.I regret that the commissioner embarked, once again, in an imaginative intervention, and this time exciting.In Spain -I want to remind you of everyone -the problem is not that we are in the electoral period, it is that there are only twenty -five days left before the elections.The commissioner will be delighted to know that these elections will take place in twenty-five days because, after, we will probably no longer ask him this type of question.Yes, I think it is important to say that Andalusia will receive 50 % more in the community framework and that Spain also displays a record in terms of structural funds, which means that the distribution is carried out strictly respecting the application regulations and that it is decentralized through regional development plans and various community support frames.Finally, I would like to ask a concrete question to the Commissioner: do you think that the regulations of the application of the structural funds or the current distribution criteria should be changed to you seem acceptable?I find this debate exciting.I understand that he has a dimension that is not exclusively community.That said, you have to get used to the idea that there are permanent elections in all the countries of the Union.What makes me happy is that basically the structural funds, in Greece, in Spain, are the subject of discussions.Earlier, here, we were talking about citizen debates, public debates.	fr
"Information would not be the last to reach representatives selected by the people. We would no longer have to sit in the committee rooms and look at those who are sitting behind us who have access to the documents we cannot get. No longer would there would be no documents that we cannot obtain. In democracy, it is essential that the executive power serves electoral and representatives of the people. In the EU, legislative power has been transferred to the executive power. The representatives of the people's elected representatives are granted benefits, but the relevant documents on decision -making processes are kept secret. At the Presidency meetings, we have decided to invite the Ombudsman and the Commission chairman, Prod, to discuss transparency. I hope that the chairman of the Commission, Prodi says, ""Sorry, I was not aware that my work had the opposite meaning as I had promised. Thanks to the President if you should thank you now. The Mr President, who was dismayed by the fact that 14 Member States have already condemned Austria in advance, I would like to ask the Commission to expand its ambitious program for the unjust treatment of Austria. In this context, I especially thank a member of Poettering for his words. The functioning of the European Union is, as it is particularly emphasized before the inter -governmental meeting, the prerequisite for the success of the European integration process. However, it is this capacity to be threatened to a great extent, when 14 EU partnership states have refused - albeit only bilaterally - to discuss with Austria, which has resulted in shortcomings in communication. The Commission must not remain inactive in this situation. Its mission is to strive to cherish the solidarity of the contracts. Mr President of the Commission, Prodi, in this sense, will you ask you to try to make the crisis meeting between Austria and 14 EU partnerships in order to promote the trigger and the normalization of relationships. Yesterday, I pointed out a similar letter to all principals of the government, thus taking my responsibility as a parliamentary. Mr President, first thanks to the Commission Chairman Prod for his work program. I agree with the remarks that concerned that it has to be concentrated more, but that it also has to join better with the five -year plan. It seems that it is about two different documents. The first chapter of the work program begins rightly under the title ""Europe, its neighboring countries and the rest of the world"". I accept one of its first sentences: ""The Union must actively seek to solve regional and global problems.""However, in order for this role to be taken, it is very important to develop a practical form of cooperation between the Council's high representative between Solana, the Commission and the European Parliament, and that democratic control and democratic responsibility in particular are strengthened. We also think it is very important that the role of the Commission is strengthened in foreign policy. We want a much stronger common nature for this European foreign policy. However, it is also a matter of tools. It is a question of the ability to analyze non-military crises and react quickly. Think of a mosambicism. How long we had to wait before taking real action. Then there is also a very concrete issue, such as transport capacity. To this end, faster coordination must also be achieved within the European Union. Thinking about the huge mortality of the cattle in Mongolia. We know that the European Union has money in Tacis and Echo programs. But why not help? It is because there are too many bureaucratic obstacles. However, the external representation of the European Union should be better tailored to our needs for the stronger European foreign policy. In short, operational implementation is central. A relationship with Russia is tremendously important. In our case, it is that we cannot fall asleep from the criticism of the Russian contaminian policy in the Council of Europe. It is particularly sad to say that the freedom of the press has not yet been guaranteed in Russia. We had called the journalist Babitsk here next Thursday, but the Russian authorities did not let him come."	fi
Mr President, therefore, in this report, imposes an encouraging amount of proposals to improve how the authorities in the United Kingdom and elsewhere should be reacted to this illness. Recommended by the introduction of the disease suppression method and gradual elimination, which is a system of successfully applied in Norway, the rapporteur strives to adopt a more flexible approach to the disease, which increases confidence, and not least in the insurance sector that has so far been provided with any insurance policy. Recommended for the development of research and ultimately the use of vaccination to curb and eliminate the ISA, the rapporteur also encourages the pharmaceutical industry, which has not so far been an embarrassment to invest in the development of the vaccine. So I recommend in every way and hope that Parliament will support this excellent report. I would also like to thank the rapporteur Hudhton for his report. Scotland has the most salmon cultivation throughout the European Union and covers 90 % of the British aquaculture industry. The activities are located in areas that are the most outrageous in Europe and is an economic means of coping in these areas. Recent studies have estimated that the sector generates EUR 800 million annually and 6,500 jobs depends on its existence. I believe that this report gives a clear method to apply to the control of salmon infectious anemia, which is both practical, realistic and accessible. Norwegian example shows the effectiveness of this approach. As for the checks, I oppose the revision of the rapporteur Hudghton's green colleagues, ie checks 7 and 13, not because I do not care about the risks to human health, but because of the scientific evidence, the virus does not survive at more than 25 degrees Celsius. There is a saying that the dead do not speak, and I'm sure they don't eat fish, but I eat and at the same time I look forward to implementing this report. I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur Hudghton from his report and support his original proposal additions, which are related to both compensation and to encourage the development of the vaccine. I, too, believe that checks 7 and 13 are unsuccessful, namely 13 would not only prevent the implementation of the effects that the proposal aims, but would actually make the situation even more difficult than the current rules. I do not say this to deny the importance of environmental aspects in fish farming. Rapporteur Hudghton has already referred to the final report of the ISA in the UK in cooperation between the Government and the industry, and it is worth taking into account the actions of it everywhere in fish cultivation, not just in the educational stations where the ISA has. Secondly, as we are eagerly awaiting a resolution presentation on the Katphoris report, I would say that the paragraph 28 is particularly important. It calls for the Commission and Member States to explore the implementation of the actions that prevent any negative effects that may be caused by the aquaculture marine environment. Thirdly, I very much hope that by referring to previous collection of information on fish resources, the Commission will take projects and studies that look at aquaculture from an environmental perspective, and I believe that this road will take the environment and not the road to the revision 7 and 13, and I hope that valuable members reject them. Mr President, good colleagues, I do not agree with the sophistication of my colleagues that are delighted with the mitigation of the provisions of the Directive, which is accompanied by the principle of caution and includes provisions on the protection of consumer health. Salmon infectious anemia is caused by an orthomix microvirus, which breaks down the blood of the salmon and kills the fish. The disease spreads very easily through, for example, contaminated water. The Directive, given in 1993, enables the destruction of both sick fish and virus to be destroyed in the same way as a cautious principle, if one of its cattle is ill.	fi
"The failure must certainly not be blamed on the European Parliament.It is the governments of the Member States that have so much restricted the scope.This poses an almost unsolvable task of the European Parliament.One should make friends with the thought that every opportunity to be taken to make a better legal aid.Paradoxically, I could say: It would be best to speak as little as possible about this report.The more we make it clear that it is only very small steps, the more organized crime rubs their hands, and the more clearly the blatant disability between the organized crime and the acute lack of legal cooperation.I emphasize the Council of Ministers emphatically to finally take note of reality.Above all, he should see that crime is proportional to the codification.The goal is to give the judicial authorities - especially judges and prosecutors, but also the citizens concerned - to give instruments for fighting crime without pronouncing the fundamental rights of defense and the general principles of human rights.Otherwise we only fight the symptoms, but not the causes.I therefore primarily advocate the further harmonization of criminal law in the Member States of the European Union.In my opinion, crime can only be combated in this way across borders.As long as this harmonization is still pending, you should be consistent if you want to enable legal aid.For this purpose, I had submitted an amendment, according to which legal assistance may only be provided if the authorities have initiated a persecution law for actions due to actions that are punishable according to domestic law of the requesting party and according to the Member State requested.Incidentally, I find the content of my amendment application in a change application 43, which also places this cumulative condition.This prerequisite is essential, since in my opinion the legal principle in criminal law ""Nulla Poena Sine Lege"" must be respected.As a result, every request for legal assistance in relation to a act that is hypothetically incorrect in the requested Member State contradicts this legal principle and consequently also to the basic principles of law in the requested Member State.It is therefore extremely important that this cumulative condition is accepted.Finally, I would like to repeat that colleague Di Pietro did a great job in my opinion.He has submitted a report in which all conceivable guarantees are offered for the maintenance of individual human rights and fundamental freedoms in view of the limited possibilities.If we want to convey a greater security of security to the European citizen, we have to strive for justitial cooperation.Mr President, my faction welcomes the fact that an agreement is created in order to put the daily practice of legal aid in criminal matters in rules.With the regulation, the rights and obligations of states or citizens are to be laid down with each other or in the relationship between citizens and the state.The present draft is complex: it deals with agreements between the Member States, but also has far -reaching consequences for the relationship between the citizens and the state authorities."	de
Today you have a detailed document with very specific content, as appropriate in the annual program. This is a clear action plan and a document, the content of which has been specified. For each initiative of the Commission, the competent authority, procedures, approval dates, work average, procedure of document and the proposed legal basis are mentioned. All stages that lead to the realization of these decisions are also mentioned. We have naturally emphasized especially - I do not say it because we are before Parliament, but because I find it extremely important - the responsibilities that allow a process of co -operation of Parliament. We have published all this program on the Internet, not because it is fashionable - though it is not fashionable for a major cultural change - but because in this way all citizens can access and compare. Today there is no longer a hidden or confidential program rather than a comparison program. It is an annual program and therefore needs clarity. We have raised all the issues of major importance, some of which I would like to mention in this presentation: environment, health, energy, transport, consumer protection plus the serious issue of justice. Let's start with a brief reflection on this last point. European citizens in particular seek justice to feel safe in their daily lives. Speaking of enlargement, I took into account these things, because it is very important to keep in mind the overall context. We must ensure, protect and impose discipline on this coexistence. This year we will therefore seek effective measures in terms of immigration and asylum right, areas in which we will submit specific proposals within 2000. Our orientation is clear. We need to combine open spirit, tolerance and hosting with safety. We will therefore propose measures to better reciprocate the decisions of civil and commercial law. The area of ​​justice is essential for the operation of the single market. Without a space of justice, the single market has only theoretical substance and is not a daily functional means. As for the environment, this is one of the most serious problems we have to face. Every year we find that the new problems overwhelm almost the results achieved, which is reminiscent of Sisyphus' martyrdom. There is a need for a great deal of effort because, if we do not show dynamism in environmental policy, it is almost impossible to re -launch the mountain. We have issued a White Bible on environmental responsibilities and strategy for achieving Kyoto's goals in reducing emissions. Another chapter, which I would like to say as an example of our particular program, concerns an issue that is very closely linked to the environment: the issue of fishing and the use of natural resources. We have to establish a reduction program for the number of fishing boats, since there is no longer a balance between fishing and natural breeding. We need to restore this balance and protect the environment. As for the environment, our reference point is the 2002 conference, which will take place ten years after the Rio conference. At this conference we must already have to announce specific results.	el
I say the same today. So I say that our main goal must always be sustainable development, that is, development that respects and works for the environment. For this reason, I believe that in this direction, the European Parliament, in its resolution, must also urge the Commission to implement the programs of the Structural Funds in a way that takes into account the community environmental legislation of the community, and in particular directives for the protection of natural eco -type and birds. At the same time, however, we need to avoid over -excesses so that we do not stop all programs and not accept everything if there is no guarantee that one or two settings are followed. This reminds me of the Greek saying that you can't break your head when your tooth aches. I do not propose to rush legislation. On the contrary, I suggest that we will be implemented and at the same time control the enforcement of legislation, of course, safeguarding the Parliament and the Commission. It is important to remember that the Structural Funds are used to advance very important measures and actions that are particularly concerned with the most problematic countries and regions of the Union, with very high needs, when they start to develop and converge with more advanced Member States. Mr President, we also need to know that the Structural Funds are promoted many times for programs that work for the environment. If we end without exception all these programs for the reasons for which many colleagues appeal here, after all, we will harm the environment rather than use it. Mr President, there is no disagreement that we want to comply with this law. I was surprised after reading a quote from your magazine that you have threatened to suspend European funding. I think it is unreasonable compared to what we strive to achieve. As you know, in the case of the United Kingdom, the Commission approved a timetable at the negotiation seminar to enable additional areas to be examined and their inclusion in the list. In Paris, the timetable that allowed the revised list to be presented in July and the second negotiation in October 2000. After years of delay in the previous, conservative government - Jackson Party -, we have firmly decided to fulfill our duty in good faith in the United Kingdom and comply with the appropriate legislative procedure and negotiations. This process has now begun, and I have no reason to believe that the plans for regional financing will break at this stage of the EU habitat directive or the natural birds. Therefore, I do not understand and accept the connection that this resolution seeks to achieve. However, let us be clear. If the Commission refuses to accept the program - for example in Merseyside - and thus weaken the investment worth two billion pounds, or anywhere else in the target 1 area, including Cornwall, which applies to five million people in the United Kingdom, it actually offends you, a member of the Commission, you said that the establishment of the CommissionConsistency with EU legislation - in this case with the Habitat Directive and the Directive on wild birds. Therefore, means and goals must be balanced. In the final analysis, violations of EU legislation must be referred to the Court of Justice of the European Communities. I cannot accept that such a balance means the suspension of the vital budget of the EU for the poorest and most in need of support. Commission member Barnier probably told you today, Commission member Wallström, that all European programs should be able to start without unnecessary delay, as it may be extremely difficult to replace this lost time later. Therefore, I ask a member of the Commission to assume collective responsibility for ensuring the timely implementation of programs in the Structural Fund. It is your duty as a member of a college. Unlike the previous speaker, I would like to congratulate you, a member of the Commission, your threat to interrupt European funding.	fi
It would be very beneficial for Tibet, and to all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia and the Government of the People's Republic of China would also gain a lot in credit if it responded to these attempts to start a dialogue.Question no 31 of (H-0795/99): Subject: Rejection by the Commission of the Code of good administrative conduct in the EU according to the press, the Commission rejected the proposal of the European mediator, Mr. Jacob Söderman, to grant citizens a guarantee of good administrative conduct in the European Union (EU).The Commission itself approved the idea of ​​a code of good administrative conduct, but did not accept the detailed proposal which was made of it.Instead, it has advanced a set of additional indications for a better service.Is this information exact?Why does the Commission act in this way, and how does it explain the difference thus born between discourse and action relating to the reform of the EU administration?Does she believe that this event is compatible with the five-point program decided in September with the European Parliament, and is it ready to present a detailed proposal on a code of good administrative conduct on which Parliament can also decide?The floor is to Mr. Patten, on behalf of the Commission.It seems to me that the information reported by the press to which the honorable deputy has referred is deceptive and approximate.The Commission approved at first reading, in November 1999, a code of good administrative conduct to include in its regulations.At the moment, the Commission consults its staff representatives about the document, a process that will be finalized in the following weeks.The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.It should be noted that the new commission has given immediate follow -up to the European mediator's decision of July 28, 1999, in its initiative investigation concerning the administrative code of conduct.The Commission would like to emphasize, in particular, that it has taken into account, in the drafting of the code, of all the projects of recommendation of the European mediator.The code will exclusively deal with relations between the administration of the commission and the public.It will be adopted through a decision of the binding commission on the legal level which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.The document was drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the project prepared by the European Mediator's office.In accordance with the provisions contained in the treaties, the Commission is itself responsible for establishing its payment.However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of a regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of the administrative reform.Mr. President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and ask when these directives will finally come into force.I would point out that they are already going back to 1997. The information reported by the press was misleading.I don't think there is a difference between us and the mediator.	fr
In the past, poverty and wealth were more dependent on the structures of the livelihoods. Rich were those areas that had industrial jobs, but these areas may be weighty nowadays and possibly fall into poverty, so investment in new sectors, so -called electronic production and services are also needed, because these are the sectors of the future. In my view, in my view, they did not receive proper attention to the exhibition of the Commission itself, therefore, on the part of the Industry Committee I draw the committee's attention to the matter. In conclusion, as a Committee of Energy we would wish to have had even greater emphasis on supporting renewable energy sources by the resources of the Cohesion Fund and the ERDF, and through them it was possible to coordinate the greater use of renewable energy forms, so that inadequate funding resources were funded. Mr President, I would very much like to thank Mrs Schroedter for the work she did on the subject and explain to colleagues that I am talking to my colleague, Mrs. Flautre, who attended the issue on the part of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, but who is unfortunately. I would like to draw the listeners' attention to amendments no.1 and 2, which were agreed by the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, but were not accepted by the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee. These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide social risk capital and to support financially local plans for the development of employment opportunities and to enhance social cohesion. In the past, this parliament has seen the social economy as an important potential employment factor. These amendments are also consistent with the view of this parliament that social exclusion is a serious issue that needs constructive action. We hope for those who are thinking of rejecting these amendments to have very strong arguments in both parliament and their employment citizens. In her report, Mrs Flautre also drew attention to an area where coordination is loudly absent, but is urgently necessary. The Commission's proposals refer to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five areas of action of the European Social Fund. However, the lack of specific guidelines here is a very sad event, as the idea of ​​linking social fund's interventions to employment strategy will be implemented for the first time during the programming period 2000-2006. It could be said that the omission gives the impression that the Commission does not even know how to ensure the maximum possible coordination between the European Social Fund's interventions, which will be revised after three and a half years, and the annual national plans for the employment of the Member States. We hope that the Commission will be able to assure us that it was a omission, which is now being treated constructively. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, Ladies and Gentlemen, the proposal submitted by the Commission, in the exercise of the order entrusted to it, is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.	el
"Constantism for the Structural Funds - which had been unanimously accepted by all Member States last year - clearly stipulates that in advance evaluation is a prerequisite for the plans and files of the projects that Member States submit to the Commission for approval. Constantism for the structural funds also stipulates that the environmental assessment of this in advance is the environmental assessment, in particular the areas that could possibly be influenced by an intervention by structural funds. The Commission has consequently the task of being careful to have been informed through the dossiers of areas that potentially fall into European environmental protection before it approves the plans. The submission of lists for the areas of the ""flora, fauna, habitat"" directives is not even meaningful even in terms of content - because in this case the protected areas would be limited to adapt to the planned investments (and would not be the protected areas of the framework)Committee, that is, the conflicts in the design would entail long -standing disputes. It is a delusion if the Commission believes that through Article 39 it will be able to make up for what it did not request in advance. How can such a committee be reliable for European citizens when it is not capable of imposing its own claims? With its withdrawal, the Commission has lost the confidence of many people who believe that sustainable development is the opportunity for the next generation., in writing.(FR) French MPs of the Group Union for Europe of Nations attach great importance to the preservation of natural heritage in general and ecological sensitive areas in particular. We share the concern of the preservation of an environment that we have an obligation to pass on to our children. It is a commendable and necessary ambition. However, the Commission, faithful to nature and its habits, cannot fail to seize the opportunity to burden their Member States and their citizens with new instructions and insignificant meticulous rules that rarely take into account local realities. The only consequence of such an exaggeration is to paralyze economic operators a little more every day and to limit business freedom. This was done, for example, with commerce and environment committees that mean to turn our farmers into environmental civil servants, paid not by their work, but with subsidies paid to compensate for their submission to Brussels Gosplan. So we categorically refuse to link, as Ms Jackson proposes, the payments of the structural funds by transferring environmental law to national law from the Member States. We would then have a very dangerous mix that would pave the way for a generalized practice of economic blackmail, blackmail even more inadmissible, given that the credits of the structural funds remain above all, we must remind, the fruit of the contributions paid by the Member States. MALMSTRFM Report (A5-0060/2000) (PPE-DE).(NL) Mr President, I would like to thank Parliament for the support of Mongolia."	el
If Parliament wants to control effectively, the documents must be available and I would like to know what the Commission plans to do to remedy it.Another word about a posteriori control, the DAS.The Van Hulten report also says it in part: I think it would be good for we assigned encrypted notes by category and by sector as to how the budget is executed.The general impression for the moment is that everything is bad in the budget of Europe.However, we have clearly observed in recent years a tendency to improve in the agricultural sector and a degradation in structural expenditure.Is it possible?I suggest that the Commission set up a deadline for implementing reforms.If we welcome new member states, it is not tolerable that the order does not reign in our own institution.Mr. President, dear colleagues, above all, thank you to my colleague, Mr. Van Hulten.This is his first report in front of the Assembly.This deserves congratulations, although I regret that he did not present his report in his mother tongue.My dear colleagues, this report was difficult to establish and it may happen too late.This is due in my opinion to the bickering between the two large groups sitting in the budget control committee.Let's be honest.The second report of the independent expert committee arrived in September.We are now four months later.Meanwhile, Mr. Van Hulten was overwhelmed with amendments, more than a hundred in the first round.He got back to work and rewritten his report taking into account a large number of suggestions, for still receiving nearly 100 amendments during the second round.This is what explains the too late presentation, I fear, of this excessively detailed and bulky report.In addition, according to my information, the Commission has just approved a report on the reform of the Commission, which will be sent for consultation in the various institutions and therefore also in Parliament, I hope.Mr. Kinnock may be able to lift a corner of the veil this evening about this?Dear Mr. Van Hulten, the group of Greens and Regionalists of the European Free Alliance will support tomorrow in plenary session the amendments that try to further improve this report.This has no sense to resume word for word in your report The many very valid recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts.If tomorrow, we vot against certain amendments or against certain paragraphs, it will certainly not be because of their content but only in order to make your report a more readable synthesis.In any case, it must be clear that my group completely supports the recommendations of the independent expert committee.Anyway, I can't wait to read the document approved today by the Commission.Whatever it is, I'm feverishly waiting for the white paper that is to be released in February.	fr
Also, the fact that there is or still in force in some Member States is in force is contrary to all human rights principles. If the European Union wants to expand and be a close system that can be compared to the international community, the European Union's institutions are of course a strong and consistent reaction, but it is also necessary that each of us leaves their national political interests and works for the Union with politically and above all, with the help of a human vote. We all know that this report does not bind our governments;As long as the Book of Fundamental Rights is not completed and is not included in the Treaties, we cannot make other criticism other than the invitation to the Member States. However, political responsibility should exceed this obstacle. At the same time as the Union seeks to acquire independent military troops in order to intervene in situations where the rule of law is questioned, and while Copenhagen's criteria are an essential part of the Community Code, which the applicant states must adopt, it is impossible to accept that the 15 Member State is still very unnecessary. We need to do more and encourage our governments to be thoroughly Europeans. Many said the same before me, that is, the fact that the European Union is not, cannot, and should not only mean the economy. The European Union is something much deeper, has common roots, and it is a dream to fight, above all, through civilian rights. Mr President, we could call today's session as a celebration of human rights. Some who have back thoughts could say that Europe is whipping their own guilt. In my opinion, Europe again gives wings to its wishes and opportunities. Human rights issues are the primary capital and foundation of European development. They are something that is by no means allowed to make exceptions. We demand different criteria from future states and all other countries. One example is the death penalty, although there is an ally country, America, where - I say this as a sarcastic international matter - the death penalty is valid and used. I say this because if we want to build a Europe that is built on the principle of humanism, it should never make concessions for political purposes, but in the future it must be acted in a mature way. These four votes are also good. They need some improvements, and I think the whole Parliament will contribute to them without the pursuit of their own interests and backgrounds. In particular, Belder's report on candidate states is a very good report, and I hope it will be even better at the end. For participation and consensus, I have the temptation to read two songs here, two proposals for two candidates. Cyprus: This candidate state meets Copenhagen's criteria. In passing, very little progress has been achieved in the end of the island's political divide. Turkish: According to the Commission's report, Turkey has not progressed in the most important problem, at all in the Kurdish issue. In short, the country still does not meet the criteria for Copenhagen. We are in favor of joining Turkey to the European Union. However, the principles should not be derogated from for anyone. The Mr President, the Mr President of the Council, the Members of the Commission, I would like to say, above all, one thing about Belder's report: it is excellent, very sincere and very important. I would like to give it my full support. It is based on European fundamental values, which themselves strongly oppose racism, alien hatred and anti -Semitism. I believe that only those who take these fundamental values ​​in the European Union may also make criticism outwards, where these basic values ​​are violated. Therefore, I believe that the debate on the Austrian government is so important if it is taken seriously because it is about the struggle for these European basic values ​​and defending them in indoor and appearance.	fi
It would be unauthorized waste to not use women's resources in decision -making. Women should not only support half of heaven, but also have the right to take their responsibility for decisions on the whole world. Mr President, I consider the excellent speeches used by the Council's Presidential Chief and Commission member today. So we were looking forward to your operations. We are just about to start millennia and centuries, which we hope to be crucial to women and their access to decision -making sites. We want these opportunities to bring significant changes to our social life, and we also want democracy to mean equality between men and women, and we do not want to discriminate against women in economic or social terms, as it has now happened. We also want to see that expensive values ​​for women such as peace, brotherhood, equality, justice, security and environmental protection would guide the prevailing values ​​of the European Union and, if possible, life throughout the world. Therefore, it is imperative to give women the opportunity to act as a counter -force to stagnation, which has so far been a major overwhelming society filled with masculine values. We also know from our own experience that freedom and decision -making power are not requested, but is conquered. We will continue this conquest to make this new century bring us a victory, neither for men nor anyone in particular: it would only bring the profit of equality between men and women. Therefore, we must no longer lose any occasion;All Europeans at all, but women, in particular, face a major challenge in the new economy and new technologies. At the end of this month, the Lisbon Summit is particularly about women. In Europe, the level of employment must be increased, which is much lower than in the United States and Japan. That is why many more women need to work, especially in new kinds of work that is missing from the European Union. For this reason, I ask the Council and the Commission what proposals they have to make at the Lisbon's upcoming summit to promote that the new economic life and the new Europe we want to build would finally merge equality between men and women? Mr President and Mr. Commission member, I was so happy about your speech because you dared to mention those Member States - such as Finland, France and Sweden - where the political representation of women is a success, but also because you dare to mention those Member States - like my home country - which does not go as well as Greece. By the way, I have heard that the next Greek election is a threat that there are very few women on the lists. I think this is very serious. I am very grateful for this because I think it is high that we here at the Community's institutions are starting to provide concrete tools to help women get women better on the political agenda. That is why I think it is important that the parliament still requires a quota and that it is openly mentioned in the resolution. Member of the Commission, I am a quota product. I don't think any of my colleagues here could show that I would be less qualified. It is known that the meritocracy is so masculine in some of our European countries that women simply do not get any chance. In the European Union, some countries have indeed introduced the quota, and you yourself, the Member of the Commission, you referred to Belgium, where it has not been a great success. Also, it is not surprising, the dug -in Avilés Pere, and not because we do not find the necessary candidates, but therefore - as a recent Commission scientific research shows - that the quota actually only makes sense if female candidates are placed at the beginning of the election lists. For this reason, we need to discuss the quota rationally. In fact, our goal must be representative democracy as a new social agreement, a dedicated minister. However, we need to draw conclusions.	fi
In the first place, I believe it is an extremely rigid, simple and restrictive directive. Other existing water -related directives have not been followed, and in many cases the governments and the Commission have not issued regulations on how they should have been followed, though I know that it is not pleasant. The question is not to set much stricter regulations, as the problems are often related to the management of things, that everyone takes responsibility for their duties and not transfer to the legal body that the major problems associated with the water system we all know. The Directive has been made limiting;In the same sack, countries with rivers that can be sailed and lands with water shortages, which have a water shortage and the temperature in the sun is 55º or 60º. I say this because the ball doesn't have to be on our roof, the ball is in the hands of government and the Commission. Similarly, these resulting destruction and tragedy, such as the Romanian case, are not a problem for the legal control, but a problem of the body and government. In addition, the Directive is not solidarity because it has forgotten high distances, climate variability, uninhabited areas and dry areas. Thus, it is made from a general perspective. The same applies to water transfer. When it comes to water transfer, we talk about distributing wealth and about solidarity between peoples and regions, because unfortunately the country is not perfect and some areas are less and more in others. Finally, I strongly criticize the fact that the Directive does not include research on the effects. It is easy for us to demand others to evaluate the effects, but in environmental issues we should demand it from ourselves. We would have to investigate how many people, how many farmers would have to go on a roof when paying costs. There has been a study that has not even been read and I think we should consolidate the study of impact as a good political practice;But on the other hand, we make an order. Mr President, this Directive sets the basic principles of sustainable water policy in the European Union by strengthening existing directives. This is a frame that provides the protection and treatment of the surface, bottom and coastal waters of our waters by establishing national and cross-border water circles in Ireland. Ireland supports a solid common position and many reviews by the European Parliament. In the case of legislation, a period of 25 years may hardly be accepted. We do not have a problem to apply the pollutant to pay the principle to cover the cost of the use of water in the case of industry, trade or agriculture. However, I strongly believe that this Directive must include the opportunity to satisfy the basic water needs of households as a free service based on household-specific drinking, cooking and washing water quotas, as water is a prerequisite for living and access to clean water is a basic human right. Of course, households have to pay for waste and luxury use, and costs can be arranged accordingly. Ireland is quite skeptical about the introduction of water meters, as in Ireland, households have not been charged for water and there have been no water meters since 1977. In the new water circuit areas, the metrics can be considered as a very significant water supply tool, which helps to get rid of the waste of water and to properly plan future needs. The main purpose of this Directive is to promote sustainable water use in the European Union. The water is scarce and the water is a valuable resource. I think it would be ideal if the check 45 went through tomorrow so that in a common position, the water fees would still be mentioned in Article 9. It would enable the implementation of the principle of subsidiarity in cost policy for water fees, allowing each Member State to draw up its own application as long as the principles that encourage sustainable and efficient water use of this Directive are fully safeguarded.	fi
"Thus, a valuable member's attention on the strategic significance of these areas is very relevant. We participate in programs with some kind of ecological effects in the area. Our food programs are directly related to the restructuring of agriculture and also to alleviation of poverty. The purpose of these programs is to ensure that agriculture is on a healthier basis in these societies and that it is not just the rape of the country. We should continue to prioritize ecological aspects. We also note that a member of Parliament who asked the question proven to the reply of the Commission member. This does not happen often. Besides, a member of the Commission did not read him in this case. Many thanks for your today's speeches, the Member of the Commission Member Patte. Question No. 35 (H-0778/99): Subject: Greek Employment Action Program In the results of the Employment Action Program Assessment, Greek and Italy receive the most remarks from the Commission for the sake of the inconsistency of their employment-supporting actions and policies. The report mentions that Greece and Italy have not yet achieved the goals of ""employability"" and that it is uncertain whether it is possible to implement the directives for the combat and control of long -term unemployment through the current policies. The report also mentions that Greece has not at all planned a medium-term measures aimed at reducing the tax and insurance burden on the work and for satisfactory use of the European Social Fund to strengthen employment policies and that there is no concrete information on employment. Could the Commission inform me if the Greek government is committed to some action and, if so, what are they? How does the Greek government intend to deal with the problems of young people's employment and long -term unemployment, and has it drawn up provisions on the system that is suitable for the location and registration of unemployment and the control of unemployment control, and have implemented this system, or does most of the actions continue to calculate the number of unemployed people? As for the Papayannakis question, the 1999 Employment Bay Commission gave Greece some recommendations to improve the effectiveness of employment measures. The main actions concerned the need to strengthen the attempt to renew public services, which are a problem. The statistical monitoring system must be improved and implemented in accordance with the preventive policies in accordance with the Employment Package Guidelines 1 and 2. It must be said that in 1999, the Greek government applied unemployment policy with two concrete programs: ""Yes for professional life"" and ""back to work"". These programs have not yet been finalized, which could be seen whether the quantitative goals have been achieved. Today, the Greek government recognizes that there is a problem because it is not possible to list how people get employed or move out of work, and for this reason the Greek government is first committed to renewing the country's employment services, secondly to create effective employment promotion centers - this program has already started, but it is not ready - and to use the electronic employment cards and use the electricalThese policies. For the new program presented for the 2000-2006 season, funded by the Social Fund must, with the support of the Commission, use appropriations and policies to fulfill the above goals. The Commission follows closely how the Greek government fulfills its commitment. I thank the Member of the Commission for the answer. However, a consignment member of the Commission, we have the following situation ahead of us. In unemployment figures, Greece is in second place, or 11.3 % -this was not before -, the increase in unemployment has been the highest, we spend the least money for the unemployed, that is, less than a percentage of GDP, while other countries (eg France, Belgian and German) use 3-4 %, and there is no clear how the social fund's funds have been used. You told me that the Commission has made some recommendations. I admit this and I am happy about it, hopefully the recommendations will be followed. However, I have been asking for a long time: What has happened to previous policies?"	fi
On the other hand, at European level, one could study various measures to sanitize relations between hotels and tour operators, such as a regulation governing their relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in cooperation with representatives of the two sectors.In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative elements concerning the damage suffered by companies and due to bankruptcies, in order to forge an opinion from the European Confederations of Hotel and Restoration and Travel Agencies, Hotrec and ECTAA, as well as to develop and write a settlement that would regulate their relations.Since then, however, no progress has been recorded.It is therefore necessary, Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, to establish measures which would improve the quality and competitiveness of European tourism, but also would ensure, as far as possible, the operation of companies.They also have to aim at the rational use of natural and cultural resources, as well as tourism infrastructure, thus contributing to the sustainable and balanced development of tourism.To conclude, I want to congratulate Mr. Viceconte and, as Cretan, living in a tourist region, I ask you to consider tourism not only as a pleasant vacation but also as a job creator for a Europe that needs it.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Commissioner, the change of attitude recently adopted by the Commission for tourism has attracted the attention of those who, like me, have followed, in recent years, this important economic activity and its introduction into the community world.Everyone is aware that this is fundamentally due to the close cause and effect relationship between tourism and employment and recognition on the part of the European Union, after the conference which took place on this subject in 1997, of the enormous potential that constitutes tourism activity for employment.This is why the communication of the commission which we debate today is timely, just like, of course, the report of Mr. Viceconte, which contains 34 conclusions among which are 15 requests to the Commission, and for which I congratulate it.In these 15 requests, the Commission is invited to adopt concrete measures and actions without neglecting the environmental aspect and cultural protection, particularly in the ultraperipheral and island regions.Four requests are addressed to the Member States, in particular that concerning the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities as well as to establish measures favorable to tourist SMEs, particularly on the tax level and that of access to financial instruments in order to promote the creation of jobs in the sectors which use a lot of hand -to -work, such as that of tourism.Finally, we must recognize, once the absence of a legal basis for which many of us aspire in order to have a common tourism policy will be overcome, we will have to show realism and develop a strategy in this field as the Commission underlines, with the help of this Parliament, as for its relationship with employment, in which young people and women, training and quality, as well as the new companyparticular.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, my dear colleagues, I would first like to thank Mr. Viceconte for his report, which makes it possible to draw attention to a sector too often overlooked.	fr
Why should the same persons as taxpayers or future car buyers pay again to withdraw the car from which the manufacturer had profit? I can't accept that. There are amendments here today that suggest that this should be done. I can't accept it and I will not vote for that. The manufacturer is responsible for these cars and the manufacturer is the one who must provide the infrastructure and pay a reasonable part of the withdrawal costs. The common position does not exclude the possibility of paying contributions from the government. The common position is a reasonable compromise. Some of today's amendments are completely unreasonable because they completely free the car maker of the responsibility to pay a small part - if it pays something - from the cost of withdrawing cars from traffic. I cannot accept this and on the part of European taxpayers and consumers I vote against these amendments. Mr President, Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen, we all agree that we need to consider what is the proper treatment of the problem of old cars in Europe. However, the Council in this case did not pursue exemplary European environmental policy. The way the issue handled the issue The German Presidency is a shame. First, the Minister of the Environment, Mr Trittin, did not satisfactorily consult with his colleagues, and then the Chancellor Schrfder was involved in the process without the necessary knowledge and behaved like a bull in a glass shop. Nor was the Finnish Presidency's decision in June not the best possible. It presents some weaknesses. The biggest thing in my view is that the situation of the middle businesses was not sufficiently taken into account, while the automotive industry is not only made up of large companies. Middle businesses play a very big role, especially as suppliers, and we must also take into account the interests of employees in these media. If we calculate it, then there are much more than two million people in this area. This state of the middle businesses are subject to many amendments by the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy as well as the amendments of our team on Article 5 concerning expenses. The common position is not the best possible in terms of environmental policy. It does not recognize the correlations of important factors, and one cannot claim, as the Greens team's colleague did, that it is the first time that the European Parliament has weakened a common position. Because from the point of view of the environment policy it is not at all right by imposing strict and high recycling rates from preventing the production of modern cars with low consumption, such as the 3 -liter car, where a large amount of plastics is used. Therefore, we must support an amendment that allows at least exceptions in the case of cars with particularly low consumption. Of course, industry objections to this point are not irrational. But the power of the arguments of the plastic industry and the car industry would certainly increase if they were not only at the specific point in favor of reducing carbon dioxide in Europe.	el
"We also develop another proposal made by this group of expert report ""Managing Change"".I will finish my intervention on the other concerns mentioned in the draft resolution subject to this assembly.With regard to the strengthening of the connection between competition policy and social policy, allow me to remind you that the regulations in matters of merger contain a provision allowing workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission within the framework of the relevant procedure.From a general point of view, the Commission acknowledges that the various bodies must correctly take into account all aspects of this type of operation, including their effects on employment.Thus, for example, the public authorities, and in particular the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid which came into force on January 1, 2000 and aimed at ensuring that public funding remains associated with beneficiaries of regional aid and, consequently, to investment jobs.To this end, the granting of any regional aid is conditioned on the maintenance of the investment concerned for a minimum period of five years.The same provision was added to the regulations on structural funds.This means that it applies to all investments co -financed by structural funds.Social cohesion and the interaction of actions carried out at community level is at the center of the next summit, which will be held in Lisbon.I know that we will come back to these questions in the future, because we must consider the best way to adapt our actions and reform them to respond to economic and social progress in Europe.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.Mr. Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I thought I understood that you had a procedural motion.If it is a personal declaration, would you be ready to wait for the end of the debate?At that time, I will be delighted to give you the floor.Mr. President is a question of public honor for this parliament, not a personal declaration.This morning, the president of the Parliament, Ms. Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to give me the floor while I wanted to intervene for a procedural motion.It is unfortunately not the first time that Madame the President has shown this unacceptable behavior towards me.In doing so, it has violated article 142 of the regulation which stipulates that requests for speech for a reminder of the settlement have priority on any other request for speech.It has also violated article 122 of the regulation which gives the right to all deputies to intervene for a personal fact.In my case, there were observations which refuted the remarks expressed by another deputy, Mr. Vidal-Quadras.This partisan behavior of our president should be condemned very firmly.I will gladly accept his apologies at any time.Thank you for your declaration.We will certainly make sure to inform the president.I can assure you that, as far as I know, the president does not like to interrupt the votes and start a debate.The Assembly therefore liked to continue the votes.But thank you for your comments."	fr
"It will be made up of qualified auditors and its independence must be and will be guaranteed by a new provision which will be added to the financial regulations.The new service will be responsible ahead of me and will be accompanied by an audit monitoring group chaired by my colleague, Ms. Schreyer, whom I am pleased to see in this enclosure this evening.As a budget commissioner, responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.This audit monitoring group will ensure rigorous and effective monitoring of internal audits.I would like to insist strongly on the fact that the modification of our control systems will in no way signify a relaxation.The proposed modification aims to improve the efficiency of systems, both in terms of contributions and in terms of measured and responsible results.I can also guarantee in Parliament that we do not advance to what is sometimes called a ""big bang"" type approach.The prior visa of financial control for each spending service will only be abandoned if the internal control system of a service turns out to be completely adequate.I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not seem to take over the fundamental criticisms of the current centralized financial control function expressed in the two reports of the Committee of Experts.This committee clearly indicated the need to abolish the centralized prior visa.It was also clear on the need to separate the internal audit from financial control.Furthermore, I do not think that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors issued in 1997. The Court will of course be able to give its opinion on the proposals to change financial regulations, but it is useful to recall the remarks that Mr. Karlsson made in this enclosure last month: the internal control of the Commission, he said is not vigorous enough to avoid incorrect operations.Thus, the financial controller issued a positive prior visa in most cases of mismanagement or irregularity which was discovered recently.At the same time, the function of the internal audit is not ensured in a coordinated manner by certain bodies, in particular by the financial controller itself, by the finance inspection and by certain units managing general departments.Originally, the centralized prior approval system undoubtedly aimed to ensure vigilance, but with the years, it had the perverse effect to reduce the extent of the feeling of managers in their decision.I don't think there is real disagreement between us in this regard.I deduce from paragraph 10 that the underlying concern for deputies is that there should be a carefully directed transition.This will certainly be what will characterize change, as deputies will be able to read it in the document on the reform strategy.Our objective, that of the Committee, that of the Court of Auditors, is not to abolish financial control, but to get rid of the centralized financial control and to do better.Before going to another area, I would add that we agree with the rapporteur to say that the existing internal audit function must be maintained up to the establishment, in a few months, from the new independent internal audit service."	fr
The Council and the Commission needed two years to submit this proposal.That is why it is absolutely necessary to come to a decision in March.Delaying the matter or even risking damage to the euro would be irresponsible and also a betrayal of the citizens who should use the new, unknown banknotes.Above all, it is expected that the false covers in the countries act outside the euro zone, where the new currency is less aware.That is why the protective measures also include these countries, whose point of view was given great weight.For this reason, the proposal in its observance of the various interests can be described as solidarity and mutuality, which is also mandatory.Now the council has to gather in March and take a decision.Thank you, dear colleagues, that you listened to me.Thanks also to those who contributed to the quick treatment of this question.I am particularly thinking of the PSE parliamentary group.President, dear colleagues!First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Ms. Charlotte Cederschiöld on this report, who is an excellent starting point for the reinforcement of criminal protection against falsification of money with regard to the introduction of the euro.The euro will be brought into circulation on January 1, 2002 and then becomes one of the world's most important leading currencies.Due to its importance on the world scale, the euro will be exposed to the risk of falsification or falsification to a particularly high degree.In the present draft of a framework decision, a number of minimum regulations are therefore determined, and an attempt is made to harmonize criminal law in this area and to make its implementation more easily and more efficiently.In addition, he stipulates that the criminal protection of the euro is enforced before it is brought into circulation, whereby a legislative gap is closed in some Member States.I would like to expressly support the rapporteur in the fact that it is necessary to expand this criminal protection to the national currencies, which, after being removed from circulation, can also be exchanged.Each Member State must ensure the introduction of effective, expedient and deterrent criminal sanctions for the actions provided for in the draft of the framework decision as a criminal offense.As for the proposal to determine a maximum limit of eight years for prison terms, there will be no problems in relation to my country, which, although a maximum penalty of five years is currently planned in our Criminal Code for Consumer Face Criminal Code, has already signaled a corresponding change.On the other hand, as our rapporteur has already done for the reasons she has already done, I would like to appeal to the few Member States that still have some money stocks.You should resolve them so that you can make a decision in this regard in the short term.President!With this draft of a framework decision, there is a common proposal for a criminal regulation for the first time, which is used in all 15 Member States at the same time.This takes further steps towards the goal of developing and shaping the European Union as a space of freedom, security and law, as has been sought in Tampere.	de
"In a debate held by the Socialist Party about the process in Ireland, somebody said: 'In the end, the key element of Ireland was that all the stakeholders made the following thought: It is so important if anyone is an Irish or Englishman? Let everyone want everything they want, because Ireland and England are in the European Union and it is not worth killing if it is an Irishman or English. What does it matter since the national shapes will no longer apply! 'Here we could ask the same question: Is it so important to be Basque, Spanish or European? We discussed quite a bit about what it means to be Basque, but a modern Basque is dressed as a Dan and reads like an Englishman. If Life hires a larger dimension of internationalization - already happening - and therefore, our children will live in such a Europe, then why should we kill about it? ""He also said - probably in Ireland everyone embraces this thought -:"" But if we were killed for nothing - and there they were killed -What does it take to be Basque if there is no difference? Let everyone be what they want. If tomorrow, we are going to operate at European level in terms of the economy, politics, vital decisions of each country, then it is not worth killing. Neither to kill nor be killed for it. ""The Basque Party of the Basque Party, the sincere feelings of our solidarity. Power is the knowledge that in the Basque country the only social gap that exists is the abyss that separates those who kill, those who support them and those who understand them, by the overwhelming majority of the Basque people who are just expecting to live peacefully and with freedom.(Vivid applause) Madam President, on behalf of the Group Union for Europe of Nations, I express our suffering for the victims and our protest against terrorism and those who defend it. I believe that we are before a human tragedy, if we consider relatives and friends, a political tragedy, considering the political family to which the victims belonged, but also of a cultural tragedy because the culture of death and violence is increasingly reinforced by its democratization."	el
Following this singular procedure, Parliament refrains from imputing responsibility for the 1997 provisions where it resides, that is to say with the old commission.It was the 1996 accounts that dropped the old commission and accounts for 1997 are just as overwhelming.There is therefore no reason to grant the discharge.Regarding the decision to close the accounts, we will be able to reflect during the vote and, finally, with regard to the proposal for resolution, we especially insist on the many recommendations which have been made rightly and we will vote for.Mr. President, the discharge decision for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the previous commission had already presented its resignation to the date scheduled for this decision and only managed current affairs.Now, Ms. Van der Laan, to which we should pay tribute to all the work she has accomplished, invites us in her report to be discharged to the Commission for the year 1997. We may wonder why the current commission must receive discharge for the execution of the general budget of the previous commission - Mr. Camre also reported -, all the more since the discharge for the year 96 was refused.But it is so.Since its entry into office, the new commission must assume responsibility for the acts, but also for the shortcomings of the past.As the system of collegial responsibility which prevails within the Commission allows us to make in all and for all three decisions in matters of discharge, namely a grant, a postponement or a refusal, the fact that four commissioners having belonged to the previous commission are again found today in this body has no more impact.This question should have been asked during the inauguration of the new commission.If the Parliament approves this week the proposal made by the Budget Control Commission and grants the discharge, the Commission would however be wrong to consider this decision as a white check.I am in fact of opinion that the third part of Ms. Van der Laan's report, namely the resolution proposal, is the most important.The obligations it contains, taken up under eight different titles, are an integral part of the discharge.It is on its execution that our decision depends.During the discharge for the following financial year - the year 1998 is already on the exam - Parliament will have to check very carefully if it has not congratulated the commission in a somewhat too premature manner.We will have a sidelines from the moment when the commission will present its reform program.The discharge for the 1998 exercise will allow us to know if efficiency, transparency, responsibility as well as an attitude of opening in relation to the discharge authorities prevail.Mr. President, we all know that Parliament has decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year while waiting to know the internal reform commitments that the new commission would adopt.	fr
"What is the situation today? Do we have results from this study research? You know that we EDD members, together with others, defend rural life, retention of employment and social cohesion of rural areas, which are reinforced by public and high quality general services. I would like to be convinced that the daily examples I have stated daily in my country and in my area, which is very rural, allow the bold transition to a new phase. Unfortunately, this is not the case, and nowadays, because we confuse the application of the application of the European Directive and the application of 35 hours of work, which is a very French law, but also by changing the basics of working time so that one place to handle 1700 items per hour compared to previous 1,400 goodsThis already means a reduction in public services, which cannot be allowed. I have a magazine in my own municipality here, ""The Post Director informs the population that from January 3, 2000 - this is very timely - the last emptying of the mailbox is at 3:45 pm, when it was earlier at 4 pm 30.""You understand that I suspect the broader phase of release and the many measures it brings to it that lead to a new wave of desertion. You know that we have our own post office in each village or at least our own mailbox, where the mail is collected daily. The mail carrier is not only a mail distributor, but the only social connection link to the residents. He also brings money, and sometimes even medications, and thanks to him, the elderly and people living in remote areas can live at home. If the release of postal services is not properly monitored, other offices will be closed in the name of this too famous profitability, which is often the cause of rural recession. Once again, Europe is alienated by the poorest and most vulnerable inhabitants. They are told that they will be expensive without comparing this with other social, police and health services, nor to educational and cultural services, whose deficits are unlikely to be granted in an urban environment. Everyone must be able to choose their own lifestyle. This should still happen so that the opportunities and treatment are even somewhat equal. There is a saying in sports circles: a winning team is not changed. Why should we change something that satisfies us? In the field of universal service, social tasks can only be performed if it retains its monopoly to balance its budget. We cannot take responsibility for the mistake because we are convinced that we do not want to go back and that, in an unbalanced case, the company knows how to act: to dismantle jobs, reduce services, cut off a sick branch, and we already know which branch is considered to be sick. We are told: Let us move from 350 grams to 150 grams or up to 50 grams. Let it be like this. But this difference between 200 grams is sought by many private bodies, which are thus profitable. So why not once again leave things to do and allow the public service to fund ourselves and be responsible for the annual additional costs of its public interest duties, and in this case Senator Larcher, have estimated to be 8 billion francs? If the income decreases, the number of non -profit tasks will be reduced and once again, operations in rural areas will be abolished. So, in my opinion, we have the time to wait and, above all, get to know the financial and social effects of the one-stage release before we take the risk of shaking one of our public services that many of our compatriots are attached to. Mr President, I am one of those who think it is this service that should be created by the entire European rules. If you want to provide the freedom to provide foreign mail services, it would only be reasonable and sensible to have common rules for this service in Europe."	fi
AIDS is such a big problem in Africa today that more people die from this disease than in conflicts.I hope the minister will take the time to go into this special point.The USA already have medication, but they are not ready to sell these medications at a price that is affordable for the people of Africa.I would like to ask the minister what he will do in Ethiopia in relation to the emerging location.The country suffers from droughts and misfortunes, and in six months the same problems will occur as a few years ago when thousands of people died during a famine.At the same time, the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia continues unabated;The European armaments industry delivers plenty of weapons, and then we come and deliver the food.Mr. MP, you have to understand that, first of all, I do not agree with the way you interpret my colleague's speech at the meeting of the Committee on Development.There is no contradiction between these points of view, on the contrary.In the program of a presidency, we cannot do something like an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginable situations in relation to all major problems, especially in the context of the outdoor relationships, at most in a seizure of megalomania.It would be easy to do something like you understand.You only need to take a flow of development and write down all questions one after the other.We are responsible enough to recognize that we can only accept the questions that we can treat as part of our presidency and within the framework of the possibilities of governments at the council level - and one must always be aware of it.We have to understand that there are limits here in relation to the enforcement options, especially in the national guide programs.The MP has pointed out the problem of Ethiopia, which is included in the framework of the national guidelines, but as you know, there are various measures for AIDS fighting at community level, and in this regard you are right, Mr. MP, probably the United States will also do nothing better.Incidentally, I think that Europe does not have to worry about development aid policy, and for the simple reason because our behavior in this area withstands every comparison with the United States.The MP's question then passed the problem of the negative effects the armor has.This is a problem of further political importance, which is probably the framework of the actual question, but that the Council will of course discuss in the future if it intends to tackle it in a special connection.Is the advice of social problems that cause the EU's food exports below the producer prices in the developing countries?Does the chair intend to do something on this matter?Since the questioner is not present, request No. 13 is obsolete.I would like to thank the incumbent Council President and personally welcome him to the Portuguese government's presidency.Allow me to pronounce my recognition for his eloquence and his well -founded knowledge of European affairs.	de
This situation is generally caused by the Union's economic and social policy.Width sections of the Union emphasize this policy as dangerous and anti -people.Unfortunately, the new guidelines go in the same direction, and nothing indicates that their implementation will change something.President, dear colleagues!Allow me to say a few short words here to emphasize two points that these reports remind us of and those in the idea we have from the Union play an essential strategic role.The first is the relevant and central importance that we still attach to the principle of economic and social cohesion.We express our concern about reports that we can see that the importance of this goal in the commission's views increasingly subsides.We are still of the opinion that the economic and social cohesion is a central goal of the Union.Secondly, I agree with what I have already heard of a colleague about the topic of the islands here, and I would also like to draw attention to the areas in an extremely outskirts.In the future, we would be happy about more courage in the treatment of the topic of the areas in an extremely outskirts, as is the case in the case of my home country for the island groups of the Azores and Madeiras.I take this opportunity to ask whether the Commission can inform us about the reasons why the Commission's report about the areas in extreme outskirts, which has been expected in Parliament for a long time.President!First of all, my thanks to the rapporteur, also for the willing to take up suggestions on our part in the report.Mr. President, my very worshiped ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Commissioner!With the help of guidelines, the Member States should be offered an orientation to achieve the reform goals as part of the programming.However, the commission's requirements in this regard represent their claim to give orientation, but rather represent an offer catalog of possible measures within the framework of the political fields. To give direction and set priorities is their actual sense.I am in conformity with the rapporteur that the commission document unfortunately contains too few recommendations to the member states for administrative references, and underlining claims such as concentration in the event of negotiations on the promotion of a favorable environment for labor -intensive small and medium -sized companies, on a clear objective for alternative sources of financing, including regulations for risk capital and private financing, on operational start aids, including new onesInformation technologies and investments in innovative areas.My special support applies to an amendment to my faction on Section 10, which should ensure an appropriate inclusion of the private sector when planning and implementing the projects.I would be happy, Ms. Schroedter, if you included this change in change, especially from the aspect of subsidiarity in your positive considerations.President, Mr. Commissioner!In the committee for employment and social affairs, we unanimously took the view that the support of the interventions of the structure and cohesion funds in favor of better employment opportunities for the unemployed and equality between men and women is of strategic and priority importance.Unfortunately, the excellent report Schroedter did not consider this idea, although there are numerous evidence of this - we will see this later in the report - how these funds really help the less developed regions to bridge the distance between them and the most developed regions in Europe.	de
There is also the issue mentioned by Mr Salafranca, for whom I am sorry that he cannot be with us here at the end of this short but useful discussion. There is also the issue of our overall human rights policy and the relationship between human rights and foreign policy. I would like to remind Parliament that the Commission will, before the middle of the year, make a comprehensive theoretical examination to put human rights at the center of the development of common foreign policy and policy security. It is extremely important, and if I had not already thought about it, I would definitely think of it earlier listening to Mr Havel's excellent speech earlier today. The discussion was useful. I hope we can have other discussions like this. I hope we can have more specific discussions about some of the ways in which we can translate these good intentions into on -the -spot acts where they need, where people are still tortured, still hurried and still do not have those individual rights that this body, as I do. I received seven resolution proposals, submitted in accordance with Article 37 (2) of the Rules of Procedure to complete the discussion on this Declaration. The discussion ended. The vote will take place on Thursday. Cyprus and Malta The Daily provision provides for the joint debate on: the Council's statement on the position of the European Union in terms of the evolution of the Cyprus issue; the report (A4-0029/2000) of Mr. Brok, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policyof the pre -tax strategy for Cyprus and Malta (COM (1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199 (CNS)). Mr Seixas da Costa, as a representative of the Council, has the reason. Mr President, gentlemen, I would like to convey to you, on behalf of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union, some information on the reopening of intra -Cypriot negotiations and the recent developments regarding this issue. I think everyone thinks that what happened in Helsinki at the end of last year, as well as the new climate formed, specifically in the context of relations between the European Union and Turkey, reflects a new scene within the community, which may not affect the evolution of the two communities itself. I would like to point out that at the beginning of December of the past year the first round of negotiations, which had been interrupted for many years, was held in New York, among the representatives of the Cypriot communities living in the north and southern part of the island. These negotiations took the form of indirect talks, which were held under the mediation of the United Nations Special Representative, Mr. Alvaro de Souto. A second round took place this January this year since January 31, and a third round of negotiations is projected to start in New York on May 23, with the possibility - although this has not yet been confirmed - these latest talks may be able to be able to be able to work directly.	el
I will therefore judge on the acts.In the meantime, I approve and encourage this will clearly expressed in your communication.However, two points are essential: the simplification and application of Community law.In 1998 there were 123 referrals from the Court of Justice for non -application or non -transposition and 25 % of environmental matters are not applied or are not transposed.The events of the past few days show us how essential this is.Community law should not remain inappropriate because it is too complex or too tight.The union must not fall into this flaw and, there again, I regret that your communication does not go more in detail.You are realistic that the welfare state will no longer be able to provide the right answers to the problems we encounter and, among other things, unemployed.However, I regret that a clear option has not been advanced.The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any assistantship policy and, on the contrary, on the development of the initiative and the responsibility.You do not insist on the aging of our population, this aging which will have fundamental implications on the structure of our society, not only from the economic point of view but also in terms of public health.It is in fact a silent revolution and, from this point of view, I expected more of your communication.Finally, you insist on European research at the curled of our future.However, you do not tell us the means you want to work.The ethical principles are also at the heart of this research.Your communication says nothing about it.Mr. President, you want to better inform citizen.Start by strengthening links with Parliament: we are the representatives of these citizens.Madam President, dear colleagues, we can only agree on the general guidelines of the five -year program and the program for the year 2000, illustrated this morning with such a passion by the Prodi president.In the two documents, the emphasis was placed on the need to define new forms of European government and to implement for this purpose, a new agenda of the Commission, by defining the most immediate priorities in pursuit of the objective of full employment, thanks to a more effective coordination of the economic and social policies of the States and - I allow myself to emphasize - especially nations that participate in the monetary union and that we must be able to constitute the first example of cooperationreinforced.I will limit myself to this purpose to underline the importance of three priority choices, among others, which should inspire, also in the formulation of the action programs of the governments of the countries of the Union, in addition to the Commission agenda, the work of the European Union in the coming months.First, promotion and participation in the definition of common projects for the creation of an integrated network of services in the transport and energy sectors, with the support of the European Investment Bank.Second, adoption, as a binding parameters in the formulation of employment programs in terms of employment, investments to be carried out in different countries and through community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and qualification of the human factor.	fr
In the committee, the Commission referred to the fact that it provides to submit a Novel Food Directive in the future.However, this should not be an obstacle to make the alignment in this case, so that there is no legal uncertainty here with different guidelines.Therefore, we assume that you will also accept our amendment to this genetically modified organisms.The fact that the old text still stands in this directive 70/524 has to do with the fact that the seed guideline in 1986 was presented in parliament and that we negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this Directive 1994 was treated, and obviously the parliament did not allow the genetically modified organisms to have the same importance as I later had a report.Therefore, we believe, Mr. Commissioner Byrne, that the amendments submitted by us are also accepted by you with regard to the legal basis.If this is not the case, we have to reserve the right to transfer this report back into the committee, so that, like us, like we did the Saatgut Directive, to negotiate with you via this sensitive point, whereby I once again indicate that the text that we have now worked out is valid for your and for our legal service as a compromise.So we don't have to negotiate the text again, but we only have to include this text in this directive.I am excited to be commissioner Byrne, what you will say about our suggestions!President!Mr. Commissioner!Is the regulation of the additives in feed a matter of competition or consumer policy?It is a question of competition for the commission and the legal committee.Certainly we have to take into account the competitiveness of the feed industry by harmonizing the regulations for substances approved before and after 1988.An increase in feed prices must be prevented, and therefore the change applications 4 and 5 must be supported by Mr. Doyle.First and foremost, however, how Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf formulated it in his report is a consumer policy topic.Food security must have an absolute priority in all discussions about animal nutrition.When we speak of the transparency of the food chain, this applies from the pitch fork to the die fork, and consequently consumer protection in animal feeding is consequently starting.Antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically modified organisms, ultimately come into the food chain of humans.As a consequence of the dioxin scandal, it was clear to all of us that we finally had to step out of this dirty corner.The regulation of the additives in animal nutrition is a step in the right direction.According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to remedy causes for the risk to human health.The emphasis is clearly on causes.Consequently, we have to close the cock to the original sources of pollutants - harmful additives in animal feed.Otherwise, I find, we find the symptoms, but do not combat the causes.The population is particularly critical of the use of GMO.We have to face the growing awareness of the population to GMO and accordingly regulate the use in feed.First, there is an additive made of genetically modified organisms or if it contains such organisms, this additive may only be approved if it is harmless to human health and the environment.	de
Mr President, this initiative is becoming more important as to how the economic and social problems in the cities of Europe intensify and their citizens are increasingly getting the impression that the administration of their city or its quarter is becoming increasingly off.In addition, there is the profound social change due to the expansion of the European Union.We therefore have to endeavor to revive the economic revival and social cohesion of our cities in good time.Coping with these problems is also urgent in view of the great radiation of the cities to the surrounding region and its historical and cultural role.However, the commitment and participation of all citizens as well as the mobilization of the less active social groups and those that are particularly affected by the effects of the economic and social crisis are necessary for the success of this project.At this point we would like to note how important the balanced participation of women or their organizations is to plan and implement the programs as part of the Urban initiative.As a committee for the rights of women and equal opportunities, we also point out that infrastructure measures that make the professional activity of women easier, especially with regard to the compatibility of professional and family obligations, as well as generally institutions that have to fund solidarity between generations that promote social solidarity.The efficient implementation of this initiative could have a multiplier effect, because this may have similar projects to be stimulated at regional and local level.This would make it possible to increase their political importance, because women must finally feel the effects of European politics in a practical way in their daily life.President!In our committee, we welcomed the fact that the Commission proposed the better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities as well as the increase in security and crime prevention as priorities for the Urban program.We considered it necessary in the committee that an economic and social revival of urban areas must go hand in hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities, so that measures that are suitable for reducing racism and xenophobia must be an integral part of the programs to be financed within the framework of urban.We have considered an increase in the feeling of security of the citizens, and thus combating everyday crime in urban crime, for a central task in reviving urban areas.Our committee has determined that innovative and efficient fighting and prevention requires differentiated measures at the local level;This includes the inclusion of crime prevention in urban planning, measures to prevent youth crime, the reintegration of criminals and models for effective cooperation between different actors at the local level, e.g.B. police, judiciary or social services.As a committee, we unanimously adopted our recommendation because it was very important for us to continue urban - which was successfully carried out in the past - because we assume that in the European Union we will only be able to realize a peaceful coexistence of all residents of the European Union in the long term.For this reason, such programs are welcome.For the largest of the four community initiatives, namely Interreg III, I would like to point out the concerns of the committee for employment and social affairs.	de
In the end, we believe that preventing such risks and scientific research to avoid or combat damage must be paid to much attention. Numerous proposals have been made and should be studied. There is no solution to disasters at the last minute. Therefore, it is important that action is taken during good weather. Mr President, after more than two months of Erika's shipwreck, the coast has still been contaminated, although it has already been cleaned. I repeat my solidarity to all the victims and would like to thank the professionals and volunteers who continue to clean the polluted beaches for their dedication to this issue. Thanks to the activities of the site itself, our parliamentary boosted by organizing a debate on 20 January and approving the resolution has been notified of the first package of action. The French government has launched the debate and made suggestions for improving shipping safety, including by combating comfort flagships and significantly improving controls. All teachings in this new oil disaster must be internalized and the community level must be made quickly;The sailing of scratchy vessels on our coasts and their landing on our ports must be prevented, dual soles and safety standards must be required of vessels carrying polluting substances and confirmation of safety standards. The actual responsible ones also need to be required to reimburse the costs of pollution. Indeed, Total Fina has to grant funds for compensation for ecological, economic and social damage and compensation to people suffering from disaster. The French state has granted funds to compensate for damage. However, I feel that the European Union has not so far expressed the solidarity of the community. Indeed, at the community level, funds must be introduced to support the cleaning of contaminated coasts, the organizations that have begun to rescue birds that have been soaked in oil, and the revitalization of disaster companies. Special compensation should be paid to fishermen and mussel breeders who have experienced high losses and have to make very large investments in revitalizing their activities and restoring consumer confidence. I am pleased with the Commission member, Fischler's statement, and note the promises he made to his parliament. I also want to say that my group is still alert and continuing by keeping in touch with the on -site assistant groups so that the victims of the disaster will quickly receive compensation and to confirm legislation at all levels with actual penalties for breach of regulations. Mr President, if the oil disaster caused by Erika has to be returned two and a half months after the ship's shipwreck, it is because the economic, social and ecological disaster, which has encountered our Atlantic coast, is actually much more serious than the first estimates suggested. Oil rafts still arrive daily on the 500 -kilometer Atlantic coast. No wonder the exact composition of the cargo has still been determined. The ecological disaster is large, perhaps greater than ever before. Large -scale emptying of tanks is increasing, and the 16,000 tonne oil in a depth of 120 meters in a depth of 120 meters means a significant risk of additional pollution. All fishing and aquaculture professionals have already suffered heavily. The main sacrifices are now mussel farmers. They were one of the most effective companies in Europe. The victims of the front line are the producers or suppliers of Vendée and Loire-Atlantique, whose products are banned. Some have already lost several years of crop, but the decline in sales by 5080 percent applies to all Atlantic coastal estuaries and even the English Channel and North Sea coasts. As for the actual fishing, the fishing with fixed gear currently suffers the most. After the mussels, the sales of crustaceans decrease sharply. Many lost fishing days concern the entire industry, and especially the fish products whose markets had recovered somewhat in recent years, the future depends entirely on consumers' attitudes, which, unfortunately, seems to be negative. The two large closely related resources of the Atlantic coast, fishing and tourism, have suffered heavily.	fi
"I think the report by colleague Swoboda is excellent and I can fully agree with him.President!I would also like to express my congratulations on his report.It is to be welcomed that so many support the approach he chose.It is about tackling the stability in the region structurally, and that is also the content of the agreement with the Republic of Macedonia, which we treat today.While the actual execution of the stability package still has to be launched, the Commission quickly worked on the development of the new instrument, the stabilization and association agreement.This begins with the contractual stabilization of the countries of the former Yugoslavia.It is about the countries that are not yet an option for a approach.This agreement is actually a kind of ""pre-advance agreement"", but with the perspective of future membership.This integration of countries via active contracts is a very good instrument, provided that the agreements specified in it are energetically implemented so that the hoped -for stabilization also occurs.Macedonia is still a potential powder barrel and, as such, has a story.But it has the ambition to get rid of this image.This requires internal stability.The new government will be addressed and the agreement can be an agenda for reforms, including the direct participation and equality of the Albanian minority.Above all, the country needs peace and quiet to create order inside and to find the way to more prosperity.We, the Social Democrats, appeal to the opposition to behave accordingly.She must support the Macedonia model here.The country also needs and, above all, stability to the outside.What use is inner stability if the environment is unstable?This stability is required in relationships with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.The region must take note that Macedonia exists and will continue to exist.External stability means open borders and regional cooperation.Minorities and majorities have to get space for human and cultural exchange.Macedonia's stability is closely interlinked by development in neighboring countries.The Kosovo problem is known, where the international community is massively present.Apparently the Albania factor is underestimated.According to the Union, the time for a stabilization and association agreement with this country is not yet ripe.But when?The arguments in particular to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania fulfill us with so much concern that a waiting attitude of the Union towards Albania is really not acceptable.What position does the Commission draw on this question?Yugoslavia is also a weak point in stability and thus represents a threat to a stable Macedonia. We have to wait and see what is happening there.The mood in Belgrade is more difficult to assess every day.However, we support the decision of the council to shift the focus of the sanctions.At least this is finally trying to strengthen the opposition, which prepares for a new round of demonstrations, to strengthen his back.What will the Union continue to do in this direction, should the opposition request be given up for the opposition?"	de
"We stated in the statement we had given yesterday morning, as the Commission chairman said this afternoon that we would agree on the concern expressed in the declaration of 14 Member States on Monday. Secondly, we said in particular that we are closely following the development of the situation in Austria closely in cooperation with all Member States. Thirdly, we stated in particular that we defend, without fear and favors, the values ​​and provisions of Article 6 of the establishment agreement, and that, in accordance with Article 7 of the Treaty, we ensure that these values ​​of freedom and democracy and basic freedom are respected. This is in no way complacent, weak or contradictory. And when I say that the Commission adopted this view, I also mean my good colleague Franz Fischler, who is from Austria and once again proved to be a member of the European Commission as a member of the European Commission as a member of the European Commission. Thus, anyone who demands Franz Fischler in one way to the account for being an Austrian in nationality should investigate his or her own purpose in a debate that has inevitably overshadowed references to the grassland and even more dangerous disadvantages in the world. I say this as a friendship and tribute to my friend and colleague Franz Fischler. In addition, I would like to say that the President Da Costa showed very clearly that the Presidential State Portugal understands our position when he said and quoted him that ""Portugal and other Member States want to make sure that the current situation does not affect the operation of the community.""It is certainly in everyone's interest. To ensure that the establishment agreement is respected and that we maintain the so -called community machinery, we follow the approach described in our statement yesterday. We will continue to do so without fear and without favoring anyone. It is our duty. It is also a matter of conviction. Finally, I say one thing. We understand the backgrounds of this essential discussion. In addition, there are several people here, for whom Jörg Haider's offensive statements, many of his policies, and his strategy, and his strategy, which is an offensive, followed by an apology, sometimes even the next day, has been familiar for years. We also know it and we also remember that his memory is sometimes short and selective in Nazism. And when we remember it, it naturally wakes up the instincts of me and my colleagues, as well as the instincts of many other members of the parliamentary trends. However, the Commission must act on the values ​​and the law, not just instinct. For this reason, we ended up on a certain conclusion yesterday morning. For this reason, we stick to that conclusion and continue to maintain values ​​and law. We are not weak, complaints and contradictory, but serve the whole Union and every Member State of the Union and its citizens. So we do so in a response to actively and consistently, and as a member of Cox said in the discussion, absolutely vigilant. As the chairman of the Council, Da Costa has listened to these observations at the back of the Chamber, could a member of the Commission Kinnock confirmed that the Commission supports the view of the Council Da Costa today and the recent statement by the Presidential State in the statement of the principals of the board of directors? Does the Commission support the Council?.(EN) President, when the Commission said yesterday morning that it noted the views expressed by 14 Member States in a joint statement and agree with the concern behind the view, I think it can be taken for granted that since yesterday, as soon as the Commission may have discussed the view of 14 Member States. Thanks, Commission member Kinnock. I now have a significant political debate that is up to date and the one that we might have expected. I thank you, good colleagues. The discussion on important, current and urgent topics have ended. The vote will be made tomorrow at 11am. The next -to -pre -preparedness principle on the agenda is the Commission's Communication on the principle of preparation for pre -preparedness."	fi
According to information from the international atomic energy organization, the design of the power plant is prepared for earthquakes, which are potentially stronger than any earthquake found in the area, and especially more than 10 times stronger than the earthquake in Adana in June 1998. There is a lot of room for maneuver in the design to ensure the safe operation of the power plant in accordance with the site's environmental conditions. In addition, the Commission is aware of the concern that the power plant may be used to produce nuclear -friendly material. It recognizes the fact that Turkey has signed and ratified the nuclear barrier agreement and has since concluded a comprehensive control agreement with the International Atomic Energy Organization. Thanks for the answer. I want to emphasize the following: Turkey is now a candidate state. With this plan, it aims to increase its energy production by 2 %. At the same time, it seeks to acquire Candu-type reactors from Canada, which have shown that in Pakistan and India they have already been used for the production of nuclear weapons. Thus, there is a very great danger against this background that some stupidity thinks that the new geopolitical balance of the Caucasus requires a neighboring country with military nuclear technology. This is about the political side of the matter. I move to the technical side of the matter. In such a project, the safety factor - I speak as an engineer - is not in relation to the risk of accidents at 10 or 20 times. When uncertainty occurs in such cases, simulations are used. However, simulations cannot be used when it comes to nuclear power. In this sense, the construction of such nuclear power plants is strictly prohibited in all areas of high earthquake. Thus, because the European Union and the Commission already have different opportunities for Turkey, it would be good if Turkey would discuss the safety of the area more broadly and the peaceful development of Turkey under the European Union..(EN) In Parliament, a couple of weeks ago we discussed the issue of nuclear safety, especially for candidates. I have investigated the Commission's position. You have to accept the fact that there is no community regulation on nuclear safety. Therefore, we are trying to convince some membership states by political means that we need to have disharge plans for some reactors that are not considered to be updated. In Turkey, it is a different matter. The power plant has not yet been built. I have already said that Turkey is a party in the nuclear barrier agreement and the Nuclear Safety Convention. If we find that the nuclear power plant in question that it has safety problems, we will discuss it with Turkey. If it is considered that Turkey intends to build a nuclear power plant that does not meet ordinary European safety standards, we would have to do the same as in Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria. Mr President, a member of the Commission said that Turkey has signed a nuclear barrier agreement and a nuclear safety convention: Why then is there any doubt that Turkey's nuclear power plant is not as safe as the Community's nuclear power plants, and would a Member of the Commission be more decisive to respond to the Souladaks in this case?.(EN) Parliament, in my opinion, has the right to highlight his or her own concerns and fears. I have no such concerns. I believe that Turkey fully recognizes the norms and criteria of the Nuclear Safety Convention and the Nuclear Country Convention, but European citizens are undoubtedly concerned about it, and I think it is right to discuss them here in Parliament. Question No. 29 (H -0786/99): Subject: Ammunition containing implined uranium whether the Commission has commissioned studies cross -border pollution - due to the use of impoverished uranium in the Kosovo War - the effects of the European Union Member States? If not, why? Commission member Wallström has a speech..(EN) Thanks for your question, Bowe, a member of Parliament. The European Commission has been monitoring the environmental impact of the conflict since the beginning of the NATO operation. The Commission funded the first study already last June. It was implemented by the Central and Eastern European Regional Environmental Center and stated that there was no major environmental disaster.	fi
They must also be pursued in the context of international and multilateral agreements negotiated by the community. While the Communication reveals the Commission's commendable intentions in this area, it is also revealing about the type of activity that is absent and where there can be improvements in management and control. One can mention an excerpt from the announcement. Over -exploitation is so severe in the field of Community fishing that the scientific authorities have recommended rapid reductions in exploitation levels of up to 40%. This excerpt is in the announcement published last July. Since then, at the meeting of the Council of Ministers of Fisheries of December 16, drastic reductions have been decided on total allowable fish for various species, such as Candle and Anchougia: about 25% for the cod and 43% for Anchougia for 2000. In addition, the Committee adopted the Emergency CommissionIreland, in fact demanding that the caterpillar fishing stop at the Ireland in the period February 14-April-13 due to the crisis observed in this species. All of these are examples of the fishing sector facing serious problems due to over -exploitation. What needs to be done to mitigate the damage caused to the fishing communities? The first thought is to recognize that Community legislation needs aid and that the mechanism control procedures must be stimulated. Secondly, the authorities of such Community legislation must also be extended to the international agreements in which the community is involved. Thirdly, the European Union must be enhanced by extensive pollution monitoring and prevention measures prevailing in Community waters and which is harmful to the marine organic environment, including fishing resources. More controls may be carried out to prevent oil leakage at sea, as in the case of Erika in the Bisca Gulf as well as the deliberate dumping of oil waste. The pressures exerted on the sensitive marine water system must also be recognized due to the rise of urban planning in coastal areas. Such pressures are greater in Europe. In this context, one can mention the problems of rejecting unwanted catch, fishing tools that destroy the sea bottom and the destruction of natural habitats by intensive aquaculture. A possible alternative is to introduce a quantitative management system, such as the system that exists in New Zealand since 1986. Based on this system and taking into account the total allowable catches for a species, a market is created for individual quotas for fishing rights within a certain space, where the rights of the rights can deal with them or their rights.to other fishermen for a certain period of time. The right of ownership created by this system is the right of fishing and not the catches themselves. Such market organization can create better long -term prospects for the fishing industry. At present, dear colleagues, we can never be fully informed about the vast marine ecosystem, nor about the numerous factors that affect resources in the maritime environment. However, we should never be blinded by scientific research, we should never stop collecting information, we should never stop looking for improvements in existing systems and, if necessary, at least we should consider politics change.	el
"If there are not enough waste so that the incinerators will work, this solution will not be financially viable. We must also remember that waste does not disappear. They are converted into dioxins and toxic ash - what will you do with them? In Ireland, some operators suggest to be used as building materials. What will be the long -term effects of this? In Ireland, no matter what my colleague Hyland said, we have a terrible record for waste management. We have one of the highest landfills in Europe. Now it seems that the government is going through the landfill to incineration, which is presented as the green choice. They say, ""We are turning the waste into energy - isn't it wonderful?"", While in fact they are trying to deceive public opinion to believe that this is ecologically right. The recent court case in Ireland, where the decision was negative about the installation of an incinerator in a farm area, is of great importance. It is very important to do our actions properly by examining waste management first and foremost. The proposal by any government to use incinerators instead of landfill is completely incomplete. We need to consider the main causes that lead to waste production first.) Honorable Mr President, the amendments to the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy are generally highlighted the high level of environmental protection, and therefore many of these amendments are accepted. However, different countries have a different waste management and cremation infrastructure, and therefore the same provisions are not actually identical to all. In Finland and other countries, waste sorting near their production area has evolved. Thus, we do not incinerate mixed waste, as in other countries. Mixed combustion means bad environmental policy. After sorting the waste, the waste can be effectively incinerated in the so -called co -op, along with other fuels. The amendments to the Environment Committee arbitrarily identify the mixed incineration with co -operation. This implies indirect economic consequences that will reasonably reduce the level of environmental protection in countries that apply the waste classification system. That is why we should not accept amendments 14, 17, 18 and 27. Finally, I would like to observe that we should not prefer the competition lobby of the cement industry compared to the actual facilities of problematic waste. Consumer policy.- (in) Mr President, I agree with Mrs Grossetkte and Mrs Paulsen and - rather alarming to both of us - with Mr Bowe. However, I would like to make a specific observation about a warning message sent to the United Kingdom from the agricultural sector, literally in recent days. People with interests in the agricultural sector contacted UK MEPs, expressing serious concerns that the incinerators' directive applies to all incinerators in farms in the United Kingdom. It is said that there are several thousands of incinerators of this kind and the application of the checks described in this directive will result in increased operating costs of each incinerator by £ 200,000, as estimated."	el
Even then we have to continue this wide discussion. Opinion of the Committee of Reports.(Fr) Madam President, I would first of all congratulate all the rapporteurs on their great contribution. They managed to drive the importance of this issue to Parliament, Europe and its citizens. The purpose of this report is to give our colleagues who participate in a meeting responsible for preparing the European Charter of Fundamental Rights (Eneid) a clear and clear mandate for the expectations of the European Parliament and to provide our fellow citizens with a strong proof of our fellow citizens. Union. The scope of the Committee of Reports legitimizes its interest in preparing the map. The numerous reports received by this Commission allow it to determine how citizens perceive the Union and the rights it must protect. The purpose of the Opinion of the Reporting Committee is to bring to light the ambitions expressed by Europeans who are addressing Parliament complaining about not respecting a right of the European Union. Referring to us, referring to us, express their firm belief that they are beneficiaries of a total of rights, thus giving the impression that the European citizen is convinced that there is already an implemented constitution of the Union in which all these rights have been guaranteed, thereby preventing it. Consequently, our opinion underlines two key points, which the rapporteurs appear to share. The first concerns the necessary display of the map as a reference text for citizens, which leads to the need to have a clear and comprehensive formulation in a single and comprehensible text. The second concerns the binding force of this map that is guaranteed by the substantial legal registration of recognized rights. The natural consequence of this will is the inclusion of the future map in the body of conditions. In conclusion, I would say that it is necessary to make a quality leap in protecting fundamental rights. This report must be a unanimous message of the Parliament in order for the Council and the meeting responsible for the preparation of Eneidis to meet this expectation of the reports. Madam President, undoubtedly the Council wanted to hear the opinion of political groups, which I find very healthy. Personally, Madam President, I want to say that this discussion is taking place at the right time. The assembly that processes the map of fundamental rights has begun its work and I believe that we are already proceeding rapidly. We are coming to the content of individual and civil rights, then we will interfere with the rights of citizenship as well as the economic and social rights. Therefore, it is important for the European Parliament to define what is the mandate of the members of the delegation that represents it and to define - which I consider even more important - what are the political goals that Parliament will seek with this map of fundamental rights. Because, in the end, many times - the representative of the reporting committee is right - citizens ask us the question of why this map of fundamental rights will be drawn up.	el
. Thank you, Mr. Commissioner. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00. Stabilization and connection agreement with FYROM. The daily provision provides for the debate on Mr Swoboda's report (A5-0031/2000), on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, on the establishment of the Council's decision to issue a Council's decision to deal withof Macedonia (SEC (1999) 1279 -C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121 (COS)). Mr President, Dear Commissioner Patten, dear compatible, today we are dealing with a country that has gone through difficult times, but has evolved very well with its own strengths, but of course with the support of the international community. Therefore, tomorrow's proposal by the European Union, the Council and the Commission - I suppose tomorrow will agree with this proposal and the parliament - to conclude a stabilization and connection agreement that will be the first in Southeast Europe, in the Balkan region, is primarily our thanks toAnd financially, but mainly politically, taking into account the war in the region and its relationship with the minority there. Because it is no small thing to have a minority of 33 or 35%in their country, especially if we take into account the area where this country is located. The country and its politicians have always worked very well - of course with some differences - and this must be recognized. The Commission proposes to conclude a joint agreement with the Council. I would like to make some observations, specifically for those areas where there may be somewhat different views, although I also want to also be particularly evident the work and interest of Commissioner Patten for FYROM/Macedonia and for the whole region and express my recognition. First, regarding the regional approach, I think that if it is perceived in the right way, it is important and necessary. There must be a disposition of cooperation. This approach is correct if it is perceived not as coercion, but as a mood, as a possibility to be exploited by each country. But looking at FYROM/Macedonia, we find that there are some countries with which cooperation is very difficult, eg. Economic, as is the case with Kosovo and Albania, or politically, as with Yugoslavia. On the other hand, there have been positive developments in collaboration with Bulgaria, but especially with Greece, and this should also be recognized. The European Union will have to consider in relation to them - it has already begun to do so early this week - how the neighboring country of Yugoslavia can be included in regional cooperation, despite being done and without neglecting the criticism we have exerted on this horrible regime. As a result, I will submit tomorrow an amendment to impose centralized sanctions on the regime, but on the other hand, some facilities to the population and the economy will be provided in the interest of economic cooperation.	el
The authors of this question do not offer any solution but call for a new tax, call for an additional bureaucracy, a measure against market mechanisms and seize the plenary of an intergroup design by short-circuiting the competent parliamentary committee, in contradiction with several decisions of the Parliament.In my opinion, and I clearly say, this question is motivated by ideology and is not oriented towards a solution.I repeat that I consider this as an erroneous path.Why do we refuse the Tobin tax and consider it so much questionable?First, as the commissioner also confirmed, because it represents a very heavy burden for the capital markets.A reduced tax would also have heavy repercussions on the capital markets because such a speculation tax would greatly reduce the profitability of investments.In addition, such a measure would also greatly hamper the development of financial markets.This would go against the principle of free movement of capital which is at the curriculum of the internal market.Second, speculative capital is difficult to identify.Third, tax measures can easily be bypassed if they are not simultaneously introduced in all countries because there are many shelters.Fourth, this measure is hardly applicable on the technical level, generates a large bureaucratic and administrative load and is difficult to control.The measure that we should take relates to part of the resolution presented to us.This is the strengthening of banking control.It is a question of clarifying the responsibility of the transactions.This is an international regulatory framework.It is a question of examining national laws in order to determine whether they correspond to the rules of the Basel Committee and if the latter can be disseminated more.I have a big problem with a crucial point of this resolution that we cannot accept as it is.This is point 9. If we have followed the commissioner, we know that the knowledge of the commission on this case will lead him to say no to the Tobin tax.If the said knowledge, the debate and the arguments are such as we expose them and as they seem justified, I believe that it is irresponsible to mobilize the commission six more months and to generate in this way doing uncertainty in the financial and capital markets.The capital market does not expect from us that we are bringing uncertainty, it needs clarity.This is why we reject point 9 and ask for a separate vote.The president, the debate on the taxation of short -term financial transactions is not new.We have been discussed for twenty years from the Tabin tax proposal and, yet this question is still topical because we really need concrete and sincere answers based on scrupulous studies.We must know to what extent a taxation of short -term financial transactions is truly desirable and achievable.Today, this question actually takes on another dimension since, every day, USD 1500 billion travel around the world 24 hours a day, looking for attractive investments, and that at most 3 % of this sum is linked to the real economy.	fr
"For this reason, the European Union needs a holistic human rights policy that promotes and adhere to human rights within the EU itself. Such politics should consist of different components. First of all, there must be a guiding framework that expresses what the EU wants to guarantee to its citizens. The preparation of such a charter has now begun, but we can no longer postpone the issue of the legal status and strategic significance of this document or to transfer it to the hands of learners. This is a political issue that requires a quick answer from HVK and this Parliament. Secondly, you need to develop a selection of tools that allow a flexible reaction and that do not bring us to a situation where we have to choose either a horse or a placebo. In this context, I think about consistent documentation and data collection, professional observation methods, information development, use of money to support democratic forces in a party, and more creative use of multilateral diplomacy, such as organized dialogue and data collection trips. Third, within different EU institutions, it is necessary to clearly determine who has responsibility for human rights policy within the European Union and what tasks and competence it brings. The Commission and the Council must both get their case in this matter. It is no longer necessary for Parliament, as our rules of procedure stipulate that the Committee on Civil Freedom and Rights, and the Indigenous Affairs and the internal affairs has this competence. Therefore, it is strange that the resolution that this debate on human rights must be decided has been prepared by the department of this Parliament in the department of foreign matters, and that the committee I just mentioned as a member myself was not involved. Mr President, Parliament is restless and divided. For our credibility, we should speak in one mouth when it comes to human rights, and we should not behave in such a way that human rights within the EU are a different thing than human rights in the rest of the world. I believe this would also be good for our credibility in the UN Human Rights Commission. Mr President, what is needed to make human rights discussion other than it is currently, that is, an ideological tool that promotes the slavery of peoples and not people's freedom? First of all, one should return without limiting the perspective to people alone, for man is not the Lord of the universe to the origin of all true rights and the basic values ​​of civilization, without which the eternal demand for rights always ends with the tyranny, the bloody tyranny. With the power of ancient and medieval traditions as a whole, the whole of the universe, ie the creation of the world, and undoubtedly, to the creator's plans, should return to the universe. It would then be noted that there is no respect for children's rights within the right family, nor respect for workers 'rights except in the interest organizations that we have recently destroyed, and that citizens' rights are not respected in full -time nations. Secondly, it should be stopped using, as at the moment, to learn about human rights as an ideological war machine that is in the possession of the class that has deserved the right to unilaterally determine what the human rights are and is not covered by them. This allows for all legality and, if necessary, to deny all freedom from those who are politically false in accordance with the only accepted way of thinking. Two centuries ago, speakers of revolutionary terror said that the enemies of freedom should not be given freedom. Unfortunately, this revolution began with all forms of today's totalitarianism.""No human rights to the enemies of human rights,"" they say new world order praises at the moment, and they are dominated almost without counterclaims in economic circles, international institutions, media and cultural networks and education institutions, and I do not mention any more. For example, what is left to the Austrians' right to decide freely about their future if it is dictated by those who say what it is appropriate to do and what is not, and if these chosen leaders selected with the legal and legitimate process are received in an offensive way, as recently, in your country, the President of the Council."	fi
Only where all the activities necessary for the satisfaction of the consumer and the traveler's needs have developed around this market industry, it has been possible to create a production system and generate social growth. In these cases, it has been stated that employment is increasing more than the number of tourists, as the positive spiral of local economic growth has begun. This shows that tourism is by no means a poor man's job, as it requires huge investments in structures, infrastructure, business, professionalism, social services and education;that the tourism industry is central to the balance of many areas as it creates employment and market for all local production functions: in the fields of agriculture, small industry and handicraft, transportation, services, trade and education;that the development of community tourism is closely related to its sustainability of the community's goals;that geographical, historical-cultural and environmental diversity must be maintained. In my opinion, the European Union may, in respect of the principle of subsidiarity, complement the actions of the Member States and, for its part, strengthen the potential of tourism in some measures, such as accepting the specific legal basis of tourism policy in the basic agreements;By accepting regional policies and other Union policies, program and design mechanisms that are suitable for promoting all kinds of rural, environmental, cultural, research and education, as well as congress, spa, retirement and sports tourism;By changing the data collection of the tourism data data, the Directive 95/57, by initiating joint funding for plans to implement new services and transport infrastructures, as well as in pilot programs for joint funding and comparative assessment. These and other concrete actions I have outlined in my report can, in my opinion, add value to the actions that national and regional competent authorities should promote tourism and create new jobs, starting with the acceptance of positive taxes for small and medium -sized businesses, in particular. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, good colleagues, before presenting the positions of the Equality Committee, I would like to share with you three basics that I think will define the present and future of European tourism in the international environment. In Europe, the tourism industry now produces 5.5 % of GDP and employs a relatively large number of workforce, about 6 %. These figures are very much larger in some countries. In order to understand what tourism means in some areas of Europe, it is worthwhile to highlight my own country, Greece, which is a tourist country. Over the past 40, as the agricultural population has aged and the population focuses on major urban centers, the only areas where the young age groups will remain and where they return are developed areas of tourism. So it is clear that in Europe, in addition to economic issues, tourism is also a priority in the economic and social participation of the European Union regions. Another thing is that the world market has grown explosively. In 2010, tourists are expected to be ten billion, but unfortunately the opposite in Europe is the opposite. The proportion of growth is dramatically decreased every year for the benefit of Asia, Far East and America. After all, the world market for tourism is influenced by the liberalization of traffic, the reduction in costs and the competitiveness of new travel centers outside Europe. In addition, 90 % of companies operating in the tourism industry are SMEs;Companies that consider the economic and social tissue of our society to be viable, which must face new obstacles and positively respond to the challenges of global development. As the rapporteur said, this gets a particular importance when traveling is evaluated as a united production system because it is characterized by large amounts of agricultural and industrial products, services and transport services, and creates a lot of added value. So in this context, I want to emphasize that international competition is fierce, and in order to succeed, we must have a vision and a common long -term strategy. We need to take very seriously into account the need to improve the level of workforce working in tourism so that the tourism industry can meet the new technological challenges of our time.	fi
Now the situation is so much pointed that the Pentagon banned the American armed forces to return to northern Mitroviæa.They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.It is easy to despair in view of the violence and hatred, but for Kosovo, the Balkans and for Europe it is important that we do not fail here.The stability pact gives us great commitments.Thus, this matter becomes a test for the credibility of the union's common foreign and security policy.At the moment there is an immense lack of suitable staff in Kosovo.Bernard Kouchner already demanded a civilian police last autumn.I am therefore pleased to hear now that Mr. Javier Solana will gather the Interior Minister at the weekend to discuss the police question.I hope these conversations will primarily revolve around Kosovo, so that the desperate location can be ended there.As for the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council also supports the claim of Parliament and, as I understood, the Commission also supports the Commission for a multi -year budget for missions in Kosovo.Mr. Solana!The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, e.g.B. the creation of military capacity for crisis management, which has already been put into practice.Another, at least as important experience is that preventing a crisis is more important than later fire brigade operations.For this reason, the EU also needs independent and credible funds for conflict prevention.As for the Commission, Commissioner Patten has already undertaken several commendable initiatives in this direction.I am thinking of the proposal for setting up a Rapid Reaction Facility and a Rapid Reaction Force for non -military missions as well as the creation of headline goals for non -military missions and a commission crisis center.My last question to Mr. Javier Solana is: What specific steps are planned for conflict prevention?How is this organized in Mr. Solana's office and coordinated with the work of the Commission?President, Mr. Solana, you enjoy the full support and trust of the liberals' parliamentary group, but we would like to remind you of the huge responsibility that is now on your shoulders.On the one hand, I think of the upcoming important humanitarian, peace -based and peace -creating tasks.However, I also think of their responsibility that the new European cooperation in the field of defense does not run a wedge between NATO and the EU or between the USA and Europe.Such a split would only use those rifles and despotic states that threaten freedom and human rights.I think you have taken note of the concerns that some members of the American congress have been expressed here in Parliament last week.You have to clear these concerns, Mr. Solana.You have put it yourself so that we can do something when we work across the Atlantic.Disability makes us weak and thereby extends the suffering of the oppressed.Therefore, dear Mr. Solana, keep in touch with our American Allies as close as possible and also take into account Norway, Turkey and Canada.	de
Mr President, on behalf of the National Front, Flames' Association Party and the Italian Socialist Movement, I ask the following question: Who is behind this terrible interference with internal Austria, to which the European Union has committed by violating general international law, establishment agreements and general moral concepts? Is this hysteria born itself? Is it born of just stupidity or is it more likely to be a thoughtful strategy that is the same all over the world? Who dictates orders to European nations, imagining that nations can be denied to decide on their own future? The secrets do you network? Washington's government? Is the Israeli government? Or have their socialist racing parties, because they can force their own values ​​here? So what are the values ​​of the Socialists? After all, they collected their voters in the last century by giving those who were deprived of hope for greater social justice, and today they are only a party of protected officials, a paid trade union and a party for government. What are the values ​​of the Belgian Socialist Party when scandals like pedophile cases, corruption, vanami and Agusta are following each other? What are the values ​​of the French Socialist Party when it has forced it by tightening all the municipalities to their own will in cases of Urba, Sages and Graco. That is, François Mitterrand's party, which can boast of the actions of the Vichy government led by Marshal Pétain and whose leaders are still caught on the back when the party can thickly guide the public funds for the support of the sick students. I don't even bother to talk about the corruption of the Italian Socialist Party, because the ambulance should not be fired, and especially the body. Instead, I speak of the Spanish Socialist Party, allied with the albacette slags who handled their matter with killers hired with nationalist basses. I talk about the German Socialist Party, which believes he can teach us the history of World War II. After all, the party is international Socialist in nature, as the predecessors at the time were National Socialists, the Waffen-SS party in yellowish browns always have ... (President interrupted the speaker.) This resolution was very problematic for me. I ended up refrained from the vote for several reasons. I supported an EDD group check that rejected the lack of EU government's government formation, but I had to refrain from voting because it just continued to continue to condemn strangers, racism and so on, and I thought it might be misinterpreted. However, I wondered if this makes sense. First of all, the problem is about trying to combat intolerance with intolerance and its long -term consequences. I was also thinking about the rationality of the EU and its reaction to the formation of the Austrian government and how it affects the country's public opinion. At the moment, it seems that the support of the Haider party is increasing rather than decreasing with the opposition of foreign governments. Even the United States has said that it is considering interrupting diplomatic relationships. We are wondering if this actually fed the flames of the strangers and the parties and people that support it. I really think we should be very careful. If we want to combat strangers and racism, and I think we should do so, we need to look at the causes of the problem. We need to look at people voting for these parties and understand what the situation is. Most parliamentary members do not want such a situation, but we have to choose our approach carefully so that the end result is not the opposite of what we want. Mr President, good colleagues, stiffly fighting all kinds of xenophobic or racist statements, protests or emotions. I fiercely defend the heritage of human rights and rule of law, which is the inheritance of Europe. However, for the same reason, I disagree with the insane activity of the Presidency (unfortunately Presidium Portugal), which is a true institutional clutter on behalf of 14 other Member States. This is not the right way to combat extremists. It may even be a tremendous service for them. The confused and thoughtful criticism of the Austrian neck confuses everything nonsense, greatly interferes with honest citizens, and contains dangers that are not taken into account.	fi
It is true that the problem of the wood sector is terribly complex.You have indeed talked about unlocking funds for storage of wood because it should not be depreciated.On the other hand, the municipalities which have not been affected by storms will also undergo damage, since the National Forest Office has decided to freeze the forest cuts for four years.So these municipalities which have not suffered losses will still see their recipes decrease.All this to tell you that the problem is eminently complex and I thank the commission again to push the analysis of this situation as far as possible.I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that there is, of course, economic disaster, but that real ecological disasters are still to come.You have said it yourself, Mr. Commissioner, these disasters, these storms are not always natural and we believe that these are the first signs of climate change.So we have to review our policies to integrate this data.Mr. President, all those who arrived here by car, train or plane could see the extent of the damage caused particularly in France by the hurricanes of unprecedented violence that hit Europe at the end of last month.Faced with a disaster of such magnitude, what can elected officials of the European Parliament do?First of all, I want to salute all my mayors, local elected officials, who, on a daily basis, had to reassure the population, organize solidarity, cooperate with public services.They deserved the confidence of their fellow citizens.I then want to thank here the rescue services and the armed forces of the Member States of the Union which, as part of exemplary intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.I would also like to wonder about the paradoxical situation in which we are in terms of emergency aid.If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could immediately involve the community budget for the benefit of the victims, but in our countries nothing is possible, for lack of adequate line of credit.We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local communities and states from helping businesses disaster -based by the disaster, in the name of an overly close application of community competition rules.I especially think of particularly struck fishing and conchyliculture companies.As you said, as you said, the Commissioner, that forced activity judgments can be compensated and that the investments which are entirely to be rebuilt can call on Ifop.Beyond that, I believe that the mechanical application of POPs is no longer put in the disaster regions.I therefore ask the Commission to give it up for, on the contrary, helping sea professionals to make new investments that are urgently imposed on them.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the storms that ravaged France in the night of December 26 and 27, as we said, 90 dead, 75 billion francs, or 11 billion euros, damage.	fr
The design of the council has serious defects, especially in relation to legal protection.According to the reports of the rapporteur di Pietro, the draft even contains very significant deficits.The agreement enables a chain of request for legal welfare, whereby every member authorities and criminal law systems can be assigned to other Member States.This chain is structured in such a way that it cannot be controlled by a single judge as a whole.Flanking measures, for example the obligation for investigators, need to appear as a witness to request in every criminal matter in which their documents are used.For my faction, it is also problematic that the council draft disregards the proportional principle.In any case, the area of ​​application is not restricted.This agreement is not only applicable to combating serious crimes and organized crime.There is even nowhere that it only refers to criminal law.It is therefore quite conceivable that the European Union will soon shoot at sparrows with cannons and to dissolve the rights of citizens in smoke.Mr. President, which deals with us today with legal assistance in criminal matters, contains minimum regulations that are essential for effective and quick cooperation between the various judicial and investigative organs.It concerns the deliveries, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of imprisoned persons, the return of objects, the questioning of witness by video conference, the investigation, including the so -called hidden investigations, telephone monitoring, etc.m. This is the minimum that could be agreed, whereby it must be said that if there are some change requests such as No. 32 or No. 81 or 71 in their revised version, the overall agreement would result in the mere exchange of messages or information and could really be thrown into the trash, which is why we would be correct.I hope that the colleagues of the various political groups can be guided by their common sense and reject these amendments.The fact that it was not enough for a framework agreement, but only to an agreement, is a defeat for the European Parliament.Commissioner Vitorino will surely have taken out all the different articles, how necessary it is to create a framework for common rules, instead of continuing to continue with this incoherent regulation, these small conventions for individual areas such as the investigation or the .. It is rather absolutely necessary to create a minimum of more secure, more than the guarantees - also to ensure that it is possible to extend it as far as possibleneed to be increased.I only imagine what should become of this community, these agreements or the legal relationships if, for example, a fascist country like Turkey would join the European Union: I would be really at a loss.As everyone emphasized, we need a corpus juris and, especially in procedural law, common rules that ensure a common constitutional state throughout the community.It is obvious that this is a matter of which the government conference must mainly deal with and that the parliament can only make a limited contribution to this objective, since everything depends on the council and on the commission.In my opinion, this first half of the year, in which the responsible commissioner is Portuguese and Portugal, has the Presidency of Council, an excellent opportunity to give this joint objective a first impulse.	de
However, I took note of your comments and I will examine them more in -depth.Ms. Roth-Behrendt asked me a question about the establishment of a positive list.This is one of the questions we tackle in the appendix to the legislation and we intend to establish a positive list for substances intended for animal food.For the time being, the list is, I would say, negative and completes itself in the required manner.The establishment of a positive list constitutes one of the questions raised in the appendix and accompanied by a date, namely 2002. We have identified the fast alert system intended for animal feed as a gap in legislation.Quick alert exists for food and not for animal feed.It is unfortunate and incorrect and we think it is important to highlight it, to establish legislation in order to fill this gap and this will be done.Work in relation to ESB within Member States and the establishment of tests carried out at random in order to assess the levels of infectivity in the Member States are underway.I know that Mrs. Roth-Behrendt already asked me this question and I replied that I thought it was progressing quickly.However, I think I know that the question is at the stage of the consultation between the services within the Commission and that the work is currently underway.I hope that the next time you ask me, I will be able to provide you with more detailed information.Ms. Jackson stressed the fact that there are 24 new legislative acts and 20 modifying legislative acts.She also asks if this aggravates excess regulation.I would say that the legislative acts that we have identified are intended to fill the gaps in current legislation.This concerns less the establishment of new regimes or additional regulations, although it is part of it, than to identify where the gaps and weaknesses are located in the chain ranging from the stable to the table and to fill them.It has been referred to the candidate countries, something we keep in mind.The standards in food security and of course other areas of security are of obviously crucial importance with regard to enlargement and this is a question to which I drew the attention of Mr. Verheugen.The Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has plunged Europe into a large -scale food crisis and I am once again irritated, unfortunately, to note the total and renewed absence of the Council when you present this interesting report.I would really like you to tell me how you intend to guarantee that this new authority, whatever its detailed name, will have the influence on the advice, which will have its say within this authority, which will give the orders.It goes without saying that we cannot impose anything in terms of content but I still insist that after Maastricht and Amsterdam, the parliament retains its right, and even that it develops it.	fr
"We believe that initiatives such as common asylum policy and Eurodac - which makes applicants for asylum suspects - does not promote the fight against racism and xenophobia. I have to congratulate the Ms. rapporteur on the quality of her work on the European Commission's report on the implementation of the European year against racism (1997). Recent events in Austria prove to us that the fight against racism, anti -Semitism and xenophobia remains unfortunately timely. As the report points out, there are really reasons to ""be terrified by joining the Austrian government of the JFRG Haider party"". I take the opportunity here to confirm the need to maintain the pressure on the Austrian government and continue to feed on discussions in public opinion. Indeed, the risk of accepting this situation as a natural situation is great. And I repeat that the greatest of all the dangers is to get to the point that these things are not impressed. This rift that has been opened to what is the foundation of our European Union, that is, in unconditional respect for fundamental rights, must not create a precedent. Throughout Europe, the far -right parties hope to benefit from the rise to the power of this coalition of fascist shades. We, the European Democrats, have a duty to continue to be vigilant, to provoke the stroke that will lead to the fall of this government. Personally, I'm ready to fight to the end! I believe, like the Ms. rapporteur, that Europe's national, religious, cultural and linguistic diversity is a source of vitality and is particularly important for Europe's future economic and social prosperity. For this reason, the public authorities of the Member States and the institutions of the European Union must actively promote racial equality and take specific actions to achieve a strong national differentiation in their potential. In addition, I argue the view that the fight against racism and xenophobia, as well as the promotion of equality of opportunities, should be announced to a specific responsibility to be entrusted to a European Commissioner. Another suggestion is worth all our attention. It is proposed that the Member States include, as a compulsory material in school programs and training programs of teaching staff, the following issues: teaching about Europe in the world, including slave trade and colonialism, as well as the history and culture of minority communities;intolerance, including Holocaust and Anti -Semitism, as well as the urgent need for racial tolerance and the value of diversity. To return to Austria, one of the reasons why we have reached such extreme situations is perhaps the fact that this country did not perform to the extent that an objective memory work should have. In conclusion, I would like to ask, within the framework of the ICC, the possible amendment of the Amsterdam Treaty, notably Article 7 aimed at imposing sanctions on a Member State which will have committed a ""serious and constant violation"" of fundamental freedoms and rights. The struggle against racism and xenophobia will not be able to promote only by the establishment of the legislation appropriately but, in essence, through the take measures aimed at a thorough change in the deeper causes that shape the favorable conditions for the spread of this particular effect."	el
The FBI initiative compiled users' requirements that are based on current legislation. The Council's proposal for these requirements, Enfopol 98, was approved by Parliament last May in the Schmid report. Now we are asked to legal to set up such listening, and therefore we should look at a document that combines these two reports. The requirements propose that authorities should be able to investigate all service providers' services, that is, telephones, mobile phones and more, and because the current proposal is very poorly designed, this right can be misused. I would also like to ask the following: When the police, according to user requirements, can invariably investigate all service providers, does it also apply to the internal service of Parliament? Are we accepting the rules that allow the police to penetrate our own systems well, on a very good basis? Nor does the proposal have a threshold for serious crimes. This leaves it completely exposed to abuse. And as for the translation of the burden of proof, the default of innocence recognized in international fundamental rights is essential. It is not guaranteed. Defense rights, the basic principle of international fundamental rights, have not been properly taken into account in the introductory part or in the text. This is a very serious thing. We are very worried about which direction we are now going without public debate with national parliaments or other forums, and without the involvement of the entire European Freedom Freedom organizations, which are very concerned about such development. Mr President, I am not a member of the Committee on Civic Freedies and Rights, and the Committee on Legal and Insiders, but like almost all colleagues, I understand that there is a need for justice, freedom and safety alongside this uniform economic area. In this sense, legal cooperation in criminal law matters is important. What did I understand when reading the texts? That it is dangerous to settle for the reforms made by the Council, the contradictions, the opposing views of what Europe is, and to various legal systems that do not only cause confusion and inefficiency, but also to real dangers. As presented in Article 18 and where many colleagues drew attention to that every country, that is, every large country or country with technical conditions, can begin to monitor telecommunications in another country without the consent of the country concerned. In my opinion, the Committee on Civic Freedom and Rights, Fitness and Indoor Affairs and Rapporteur DI Pietro have provided a very interesting report. It is a shame that Di Pietro did not have time to focus on the well -made reasoning of his report during the short, five -minute speech today. However, they were heading to defend the rights of states, accused and citizens, and I think this line should be much more cohesive and much bold. However, I want to draw your attention to the fact that when this happens, there is confusion and schizophrenia in criminal justice. A child, student, or schoolboy who burns one hashtag is treated in one country, in another country, is treated as a criminal and is closed to criminal universities, ie punishment institutions and prisons. How can there be a criminal cooperation in such a situation? In the end, for this reason, I believe that we should not be particularly active in the area of ​​unification of justice when it comes to organized crime, but when it is related to the criminal offenses of citizens that are already social phenomena. In the name of the coordination of European Rights, the report drawn up by our colleague Di Pietro, a colleague di Pietro, on the intercourse on legal aid, to raise a legal case, which is tragically describing a decrease in security in Europe. On December 14, in the sleeping carriage between Calais and Ventimiglia, a small 5-year-old Clément longed for crying with her mother, with whom she was on her way to a sick grandmother. Corinne Cailaux was discovered on the train toilet, apparently raped and full of knife shocks.	fi
I made a point of view that Russia curb the weapon flow from Russia would be a very positive step in the field of common aspirations to combat terrorism. In this political story, there are two sides of war and suffering, and I believe that we must strive to understand the causes of the conflict between Russia and Tsetsenia so that we can help to stop the blood shed next time. I suggest that no sanctions should be considered, no financial sanctions against Russia this time. We have a duty, now that the war is almost over, get to the victims to provide rehabilitation assistance. Mr President, I have to present a very clear protest for a member of Markov. It is not a one -sided presentation of accusations when it is mentioned that Russia has committed genocide in Tsetsenia, as Lord Judd, Director of the delegation, has made the Council of Europe in the statement of the Council of Europe. Of course, this conflict has been attacked on both sides, but Lord Judd's diagnosis is quite unambiguous: genocide. That is why, of course, it is not enough to demand Russia to investigate attacks and war crimes. It is very unusual for the murderer to be asked to investigate his own actions, but we need international organs for this. We finally need an international war crime court and we also need to bring in law responsible for war crimes. In this respect, of course, we need to make demands to the Russian authorities, but we also have to address the matter more strongly, as it is not a simple state internal issue, but about the most severe human rights abuses in the area of ​​the Council of Europe Human Rights Agreement and the OSYJ's legal and value system. We forget that the Tsetsenian government was elected under the supervision of the OSCE and that we have also defended this legal Tsetsenian government, which, however, no longer exists because its representatives sit in the mountains and fight purely for survival. Therefore, I warn about apparent balance. Of course, the attacks of both parties must be condemned, but the genocide should not be confused with his or her victim, which means that we have to ensure that spectators are not only given humanitarian aid, and it is a high time that the EU is finally making something good. The political solution of the conflict cannot be forced by the weapons of the Russian Army, as in that case the war is renewed in a new form as a guerrilla war or as a terrorism or as an underground war. So we need to ensure that the conflict will provide a negotiating solution with the elected representatives of the Tsetsenian people. When here in Parliament today talked about the sovereignty of Western Sahara, I would already say that the people of the Tsetsenian people also have the right to live, and we must ensure the right of the Tsetsenian people to live with Russia or our own path. We are not so advanced at the moment, but we heard from an expert earlier today how to radicalize Russian society. We insist on the release of Russian radio journalist Andrei Babitsk. He was supposed to be here today in the European Parliament to tell about the situation he was an eyewitness. Babitski was not allowed to travel from Russia. He was not allowed to come to Strasbourg because the Russian authorities are afraid of a free and transparent statement from the mouth of a journalist who critically examines both parties to the war and wanted to shed some light on the truth in Parliament. It's a scandal and we can't tolerate it. Freedom of press in Russia is also a service for the Russian people! Mr President, it seems that the war that was started to eliminate terrorism is about to end that new terrorism just begins.	fi
Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, as is well known that genuine cocoa butter chocolate gives well -being. This is not the case with this directive, which we did not need at all. Nor, of course, this is the case with this adulterated chocolate fats proposed by the Council, which unfortunately did not follow the recommendations of the European Parliament at first reading. Much could also be said about the attitude of certain delegations under the Council. The consumer is now tired of being deceived. What does the Council propose to address this situation? A timid and unreadable information hidden on the back of the package. We don't ask for that. The consumer will not be able to choose with full awareness. We want obvious and clear information on the main look of the packaging. This was what we had achieved in the European Parliament at first reading. We know that the cost of fats that can replace cocoa is much lower. That is why large industries are in favor of using these substances. Does the progress of Europe consist of a constant reduction in costs? The consumer, his preference, public opinion that is seeking more and more transparency! Who today can claim to control the famous 5% of vegetable fats that may replace the genuine cocoa butter? No one. So what to do? Let us happily trust the media of our chocolate craftsmen who will have to work on a quality label. This is what the consumer is asking for. And especially let us support our rapporteur, Mr. Lannoye.. Thank you very much, Mrs. Grossetkte. Welcome to cocoa and chocolate products (continued) Mr President, Mr De Croo, dear colleagues, after discussions of twenty -five years, so let's talk here again about chocolate, such a delicious name and yet a matter. It is a matter of harmonization, preference, habit, almost culture. In short, chocolate sows discord and the conflicts are neither ideological nor even national, no matter what some may believe. I ask you what is the ideology that dictates the defense of cocoa -producing countries. Here we are in the realm of ethics. From a social point of view we are talking about millions of families living from cocoa production and which we have made official commitments. So how is this great delay justified? Sixty -six months to prepare a study of the impact of this directive will be enough time to cause irreparable damage to the export structures of these countries. It is obvious that these effects must be known in advance. If there is also a harmonization, for a consumer more demanding than ever about the quality of what he eats and who, incidentally, has asked nothing and will win absolutely nothing from this case, the most elementary is in my opinion that there is no indication of quality or no quality. Any other harmonization will guarantee the leveling, and the consumer does not want such a Europe.	el
"However, in my home country, traditions are quite different, which our prime minister made it clear, and in the United Kingdom, it is not customary to protect the rights of citizens in this way. We work differently and do not do not inefficient. In my opinion, it is quite significant that the current Socialist government of the United Kingdom is committed to the fact that the Charter does not become legal or extended to the rights that are not included in the current establishment agreements. Mr President, for those countries with a long tradition directly, of legally binding legal books, does not mean a dramatic change. However, for those who do not have these traditions, this is a rather radical step;At the same time, I'm going to follow the attitude of the United Kingdom quite closely, that is, what is said there and what is being done. Mr President, some of the discussions around the Charter of the Charter has created the impression that the word family is about to become a politically incorrect concept of the European Union. So diligently, some groups are cleaning this word out. In the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the Convention on the Rights of Children, the Social Rights Document of the Council of Europe and the European Parliament Resolution, the declaration of fundamental rights and freedoms have been made into clear formulas stating that a special need to protect the family. Unfortunately, not everyone sees this in this way, but in my opinion, there is an unnecessary contradiction between women and families, which is intended to reconnect by rejecting families rather than radically looking for a new and equal European family policy. By doing so, family values ​​are in society in the wrong or at least one -sided hands. The neo -right is on their own and climbs them with the high levels of moral complacency. That's why the theme is bored with many. However, I believe that it would be a major mistake from the European Parliament to accept this development. Families are closely related to the European concept of society. Like many others, the Christian Democrats want a society where both freedom and responsibility meet. I see that it is a society of families, because it is difficult to learn solidarity and solidarity if it is not learned in a small community. Society can be fair, but it can never love. It is too cold for it and the hand is too short. Still, this love is the condition of healthy individual development. And Europe will not benefit from progressive fundamental rights if members of society do not want to respect them. There is still socialization in families. So there is no Europe of peoples without Europe. Families need recognition, encouragement and freedom of action in their mission, and safeguard the arbitrariness of society just as individuals. In this respect, the rights and protection of families governed elsewhere must be repeated in the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union. It is clear that, especially among people who chose me, there is a great fear that this fundamental rights book is pedaling the national constitutions, such as family, marriage, and the protection and protection of the emerging and unborn life. It is good to remember that in Europe, there has been a consistent stance on the importance of supporting family and marriage and protection throughout history. This has been cherished in the constitution of all Member States and in the constitution of the States as related to the European Union as it expands. I can introduce you to the States of the Eastern European States, which ensure family and marriage, after the post-communism. I welcome that the fundamental rights book refers to family life. The first part of Article 9 states that everyone must have the right to start a family. It is inspired by Article 12 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which says that ""marriage men and women have the right to marry and establish a family in accordance with the national laws governing the exercise of this right.""Society does not recognize the role of marriage on a moral basis, but on a rational basis, that is, because of its importance that marriage has for the social and economic stability of society and future generations of education."	fi
"We can therefore only welcome the European Directive Plan that will allow these principles to be implemented. But at the same time we want to ask the key question what will happen to the checks. The draft directive stipulates that ships parked in a community intermediate port will be able to save only after a certificate demonstrating that their waste and residues were actually removed at the appropriate reception facilities. But what about ships arriving from ports outside the community? Will they also be asked for certificates? And how will the ships passing through without parking in a port? We first consider that the ports of the Member States should prohibit approach and parking on those ships that do not submit such certificates, even if they come out of waters outside the community. In addition, Member States - which under the Directive will commit the commitment to reinforce their port controls - must also commit to reinforce their mechanisms for sea controls. We know very well the pressure that sea transport is due to competition. It is useless to approve contracts and instructions that will remain a dead letter due to lack of control. Fr) The report we are called upon to vote today is indicative of the position that our European Parliament wishes to receive in the context of the sea security debate, which was raised due to the tragic shipwreck of Erika. I would like to remind you that the proposal we are discussing today aims to improve the disposal and use of host port installations for ship waste and cargo residues. It is in line with the Marpol 73/78 Convention (a contract for the prevention of ship pollution), while focusing in particular on the mechanisms of receipt and management of waste in the ports. It is part of the total Community waste management strategy and requires all ports to provide the appropriate waste reception facilities to meet the needs of the ships. Today we are in the problems of marine pollution that we need to deal with drastically by adopting decisive measures. Indeed, as the rapporteur points out, there are already rules, but they are not respected. The system that is generally implemented is what is governed by the principle of ""pollution pays"", a principle that shines through its ineffectiveness! That is why we need to find an alternative, which is suggested by an amendment I supported. It is essentially the establishment of a fee system that will be systematically paid by all ships that coach port, regardless of whether they use the waste receipt facilities or not. These fees will be funded by 90% of these facilities. This system will necessarily be an incentive to remove their ships or other waste in the ports instead of cleaning their tanks in the high seas, a remarkable practice that is widespread today. It is a common secret that some ships have even exploited the pollution caused by the Erika wreck to empty their waste into the sea, which is completely outrageous and unbearable."	el
"The Regulation on the General Provisions on Structural Funds - which all Member States unanimously accepted last year - is unequivocally said that the preliminary estimate is the prerequisite for the programs and the design documents submitted to the Commission for approval. The Regulation on Structural Funds for Structural Funds also states that this estimate includes assessing environmental status, especially in areas where the introduction of the funds of the Structural Fund may possibly be influenced. The Commission thus has an obligation to ensure that it is notified in the documents of any areas of the European nature conservation before it approves the plans. Leaving a list of areas related to the area of ​​the Directive after approved by plans is not sensible - because then the conservation areas are reduced and adapted to planned investments (and as the regulation provides that the protection areas determine the framework of investment) - and not legally meaningful, as the commission would, of course,Long -term disputes. It is a misconception if the Commission believes that it can achieve what it did not demand for the pre -estimate. How can such a Commission be credible to European citizens if it cannot pursue its own demands? As a result of its flexion, the Commission lost the confidence of many who understand sustainable development as an opportunity for the next generation..(Fr) French Parliament members of the Union for Europe of the Union for Europe are very attached to preserving natural heritage in general, and especially for ecologically sensitive areas. We distribute concerns about the preservation of the environment and our obligation is to hand over this environment untouched to our children. It is a commendable and necessary ambition. However, the Commission cannot, as faithful to its character and habits, prevent itself from being adhered to the opportunity to harass Member States and their citizens with new directives and uncertain rules, which often do not correspond to local reality. This kind of over -supply only paralyures every day a little more financial actors and limits the freedom of entrepreneurship. This was the case, for example, in the case of regional agreements for land use, which were aimed at transforming our farmer into environmental officials who do not receive their work for the fruits of their work, but to replace the grants granted to be subject to the Gosplan Committee of Brussels. That is why we refuse to connect to each other in the environment, as Jackson suggests, structural fees, and the incorporation of community legislation into the legislation of Member States. As a result, there would be a very dangerous mix of genre that would prepare the way for financial tightening in general practice. This kind of blackmail cannot be accepted therefore, since the money of the Structural Funds is primarily from the financial contributions, this must be remembered, this must be remembered. Malmström's report (A5-0060/2000) Mr President, in any case, would like to thank Parliament for the support to Mongolia's help. I hope it will make the Commission work much more actively as I have longed for such activities to this day. The Commission cannot say a country that may not have raw materials and is relatively reputable for the human rights of the area and is small and strongly agricultural: it does not mean much to us. The country is not the center of attention, but it is still in great distress. Parliament has understood it and provided support to the country and I ask the Commission to take this sign very seriously and deliver it..(Fr) At the same time, as we share the concrete concrete concrete concerns of women, especially women's rights, and our vote on certain advanced checks, our intention is not to strengthen the intention of the European Union to act so that ""respect and promotion of human rights and fundamental rights and compliance with democratic principles are basic.""Within the European Union itself, one of the fundamental rights of a person, that is, being able to live their work properly, is trampled on to nearly 20 million women and men."	fi
These were real problems, but they are all solved. For cocoa and chocolate, I repeat that these 5 % are due to the efforts to create viable conditions in neighboring countries. We are now talking about local cocoa beans that are equally important to those who collect them and make them live in Burkina Faso as coconut for Ghanaian farmers. In this case, it is not a clear inconsistency, but rather about competition between producers. The example of Caribbean sugar is a more complicated thing. The accumulation of certain such trade aspects to the sea and regions is a complex problem, but perhaps we are talking more about the interests of certain European companies than to improve income in the Caribbean. In any case, this is something we are currently investigating. I am determined to find a balance between these issues, and I would mention the agreement on the development and cooperation of South Africa as an achievement with South Africa. All reasonably it must be said that this shows that the Commission is ready for extra effort to ensure the consistency of development cooperation and the perspective of the trade benefits. We have certainly made our share to solve the problem, and sincerely I hope that we are now in the face of a soft decline and the peaceful implementation of that agreement in the coming years. Finally, I would like to thank you once again for this debate. We will return to the matter later and provide you with information on these topics, as these problems are, in one way or another, permanent for the simple reason that development cooperation means that something other than traditionally defined commercial benefits and other matters are done in the world. We have to reconcile these different approaches. Much thanks, Mr Nielson, a member of the Commission. I have received a resolution submitted to the resolution of eight rules of procedure in accordance with Article 37 (2). The discussion has ended. The vote will be made on Thursday at 12 noon. The UN Human Rights Commission's meeting on the agenda is the next Council's statement on the Union's priorities for the next meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission (March 20, 2000). Mr President, Good Members, as known, played an active role in Geneva at the 55th meeting of the Human Rights Commission in Geneva in 1999. There were resolutions about the human rights situation in the Democratic Republic of Congo and Sudan, the Democratic Republic of Congo, the Burma or Myanmar, were consulted and negotiated a statement of the Presidency of the Presidency on Colombia and East Timor. For the first time, the European Union presented a resolution on the death penalty, which was a huge success and led work on the resolution of the child's rights, which was a joint initiative of the Latin American countries. The Union will continue its role at the 56th meeting of the Human Rights Commission, which will be held in Geneva in March-April. As was agreed at the meeting of the Human Rights Council of February 9, 2000, the European Union aims to provide resolutions in particular from Israeli-occupied areas, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Congo Democratic Republic and Burma or Myanmar, the Presidency of the Presidential State's statement of Colum and possibly the order. The European Union will continue to discuss the preparation of the 56th meeting of the Human Rights Commission at the next human rights group meeting in March. There is a particular discussion about the question of whether a resolution proposal for the death penalty will eventually be made. So far, the group has not reached an agreement on what strategy should be applied to this question, and especially the wording of the compromise that it could ultimately submit to any contrary in content, such as Article 2 (7) of the UN Charter, which refers to the question of sovereignty. The compromise text was sought in advance, given the difficulties of the 1999 meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, in which the position of the Member States differed from the revision in which a reference to the European Union's resolution of the European Union was referred to in Article 2 (7). Last year, at the meeting of the 55th Human Rights Commission, as it is known, the United States decided to make a resolution on China in a very late stage. This resolution proposal was lost to the proposal for non -intervention by China.	fi
This implies priority to gender equality, adapting the social model, and above all in a clear struggle against populism in an occasion where our economic and social cohesion is threatened, and this is something that must be a top priority in the work of the Commission. It must be complemented by a clear struggle against racism and intolerance in order to confirm in practice the evolution of a union that has become a pole of attraction for the rest of the world and a zone of influx of immigrants, given its well -being and its declining demography. And this I think must be the first goal we have to pursue. As for this, I would add another element to the financial government, with a single currency - I believe it is imposed - as well as a matter on which the Commission must make progress. I would like - as my team would certainly like - in relation to the ambitious goals, and above all, in relation to something important that the Commission has done by adopting this enlargement in the process of negotiation and integration, to become clearer in terms of reviewing the agenda 2000? We also consider the issue of taxation extremely crucial. Regarding governance in general, I believe that a theoretical reflection can be very interesting. I draw attention to one thing: It is dangerous to re -raise here the issue of European Union governance as a whole. I would clearly be a fan of the auxiliary: If we are capable of determining what is our own field of governance, I think it would be very positive. I also believe that the issue of auxiliaryism also needs reflection, not only on the part of the Commission, but also by the Member States, our parliaments and civil society. Finally, Madam President, I would like to make a brief reference to the last goal, which we consider absolutely fundamentally: the stabilization of our continent and the strengthening of Europe's global role. At this point I would say that we agree and support the priority in Southeast Europe, the enlargement and - I have already pointed out - the process of integration and the strengthening of our Euro -Mediterranean program and our ability to prevent conflict, as well as a matter for which there is little reason. We must not forget Africa, the continent that is forgotten not only by God, but also by Europe, nor our significant contribution to cooperation for development. I conclude with a reference to the issue for which we are more responsible every time, being the first global economic and commercial power, for the voice of the European Union in the world, which means not only an active activity in terms of the millennium round, but also the reform of the United Nations and the International Financials. And above all, and with this I conclude, Madam President, Ladies and gentlemen, we must be able to express them in simple language, clearly, by somehow changing the way we speak, because we cannot ask for the Europeans, who live in times of significant changes,the back.	el
"However, we would like to emphasize that it is essential to accept the strategy for the new millennium as soon as possible, which is intended to give the work performed as part of the previous action plan.In the area of ​​Justitial Cooperation, important progress in the protection of criminal law of the euro has also been made, and in the European Parliament, a framework decision of fundamental and strategic importance is currently being advised.In our opinion, the EU's criminal law requires to be credible to be credible that we have to avoid multiplication of the instruments and therefore have to make joint efforts in order to be able to assume a single instrument in March that covers the entirety of the topics that are to be treated, both those that consist of France's initiatives, as well as those whose acceptance has expressly described the Commission itself.In this area, it is important that measures to mutual recognition of court decisions are put into practice, and thanks to the work already done, we consider it possible that, at least in the area of ​​confiscation of goods, steps will soon be initiated to mutual recognition of the decisions.After all, in relation to Europol, which has taken up its effective work in 1999 and caused the council to accept a number of instruments known to Parliament in order to enable his work, there is finally a fundamental question that is related to democratic control and the judicial control of Europol, which of course receive a new dimension from the political option adopted in Tampere, the area of ​​responsibility ofTo expand Europe and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.The French presidency has given us an important work document that presents different scenarios to discuss and solve the questions of the democratic and the judicial control of Europol.The Portuguese presidency will take the initiative to present a work document about the ""Euro Just"" network shortly, because although it is apparently not necessary that the judicial control of Europol via Euro was not ruled out that this is an alternative in the future.That is why it is now important that the pronunciation of the Council on the development of Europol and EuroJust takes place at the same time so that you can get the corresponding conclusions at the same time.I think in this area and in the area of ​​dialogue that the council and parliament inevitably have to lead to the development of Europol and Euro Just, we have the opportunity to find an institutionally acceptable solution for relationships between council and parliament in connection with Europol.We know the points of view of parliament and know that Parliament knows the positions of the legal services of the council.By solving the question of democratic control of Europol, this problem, I think, will find a final solution and a solution that mobilizes and strengthens the interinstitutional cooperation between everyone.President, ladies and men, men, men council members!First of all, I have to say that I am not moved - without wanting to go into an emotional competition with the gentlemen - but confused because I have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I wish that this fact that is essential for the work of our Union is not affected."	de
"For this reason, according to Bergen's actions there is a series of Community initiatives - which our committee has always supported - which aim to restore biomass of reproduction, reduce and adapt fisheries efforts to resources, protecting young fish, species and species and species,Responsible fishing. These aspects are crucial to the future of fishing, along with effective control systems. But we must not let us be seduced by maximalist considerations in this area, as in a first phase, Mr Katiphus had put in his plan. I am referring to this now because I will not have time to intervene in a later stage. In this sense, I would like to point out that the numerous amendments tabled and approved in our committee and the flexibility shown by Mr. Katiphus allowed the approval of its report by our Commission. The random, Squadron, specifically wanted to coincide in the same plenary, my report and that of Mr Katiphoris on fishing and the environment, and at the same time, the oral question of our committee - which we will consider tomorrow - regarding its serious consequences for the fishing fisheries. Marine transport and industrial and urban infection, sewage, have a negative effect on fishing. Their problems are not only due to excessive fishing. Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Fischler. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00. Fisheries Management and Maintenance of Nature in the Marine Environment The Daily provision provides for the debate on the report (A5-0017/2000) of Mr. Downhill, on behalf of the Fisheries Committee, regarding the Commission's announcement to the Council and the European Parliament: ""Managing Fisheries and Conservation of Nature""C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155 (COS)). The problems of fisheries management and environmental maintenance have been examined by this body many times in the past. This particular Commission's specific announcement is part of the Commission's overall strategy to improve the integration of environmental concerns into other Community policies. The Commission's overall strategy consists in the orientation of fishery activities at sustainable levels both economically and environmentally, through the management of scarce resources in a way that prevents them from exhaustion through over -exploitation and/or environmental degradation. The alternative to successful management is the financial weakening of the fisheries industry as it reduces stocks and the demand for fish is increasingly covered by imports. I know that in a Spanish newspaper they have described me as an enemy of the fishing industry because I made such statements. Of course, I am an enemy of fishing as well as anyone else who recommends that some do not saw the trunk in which they sit. This is an irrational policy. The announcement mainly calls for control of fishing pressure for the benefit of commercial reserves and marine ecosystems, improving measures to maintain nature in the marine environment, integrated management of coastal areas, improved training, information and transparency and transparency. All of the aforementioned priorities will be equally pursued both at the community level and in the various international forums in which the community participates."	el
On the basis of these, I believe that the proposed directive is not correct and I will vote against it. The Irish interest in this corrective directive focuses on our country's request to allow tuberculosis testing before exporting to concentration centers and not just farms as is now the practice in Ireland. I understand that we have about two years at our disposal to discuss with the Commission the difficulties we may have about and I am glad to see the commissioner here today. Under the EU's commercial rules and for the benefit of food safety and consumer confidence in animal health, annual tests are needed to maintain officially released tuberculosis status of our bovine herd. In Ireland, with a population of cattle between 7 and 8 million in recent years, about 10.5 million tuberculosis tests have taken place per year in about 138,000 herds. Since 1954, when the format for tuberculosis began to apply in our country, we have spent Ireland - small country - 2.54 billion on tuberculosis tests and then on brucellosis tests. I believe this is a testimony of our determination to protect the health of Ireland's bovine herds. Since it was even revealed that there is a reaction, a special adjacent shepherd test program is being implemented close to restricted herds. A special Tuberculosis research unit analyzes the test data on a constant basis. All slaughtered animals are routine to routine by veterinarians working in the ministry. Those animals respond positively to the tuberculin test are slaughtered. One of the early stages of the eradication scheme of the beef of tuberculosis, the Ministry of Agriculture has recognized the benefit of testing before moving, and we ask to see our particular amendment on the corrective directive favorably. I would like to ask the Commissioner to consider in particular the fact that the only test provided for in the EU and in accordance with Ireland's law is the simple intraodermic comparative test, as defined in EC Directive 64/432. I understand that there has been an important work with laboratory blood tests for tuberculosis. The most promising among them is the Test γ-interferon and is used in practical field conditions as a complement to tuberculin test on herds. I would like the Commissioner to say how the situation now has and how quickly we will be able to have an EU acceptable blood test. The tuberculin test we are now using is special for herds and not for animals. We need to go to the stage where hematological tests for individual animals will be paramount. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, the importance of legal issues of animal epidemics is a key issue not only economically but also in terms of consumer policy. In addition, there are repeatedly huge financial losses due to these epidemics. In order to take into account safety and transparency, the directive specifically aims to create electronic databases from which cattle and pigs can be recalled, as well as for their movement.	el
"(The meeting is interrupted at 13.55 and continues at 15.00) The next UN ""Human Rights"" meeting (continuity) The Daily provision provides for the discussion of the Council's statement on the determination of the Union's priorities for the next meeting of the UN Human Rights Commission (March 20). Mr President, I express my dissatisfaction with the absence of the Council Presidency. Our discussion is about a statement of the Council and I think it would be useful to present the discussion afterwards. I would like to remind, if it seems useful to me, that the fact that this point has been included on the agenda is clearly obeyed by the need, expressed by all political groups, to have a debate in Parliament in order to hear his voice on a subject so delicate and so forth. I believe that after the statement by the Council and the Commission's presidency, we can all agree that the current situation, in terms of human rights, is far from what we all would like. At the level of the Union we cannot fail to proclaim that the situation is not completely satisfactory, since, for example, while the Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms is a common element of all Member States, not all subsequent protocol has been validated or signed by all later. Also, in this regard it is clearly a disadvantage, the fact that the European Union itself has not signed the European Convention on the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, with all the disadvantages that this situation implies. I hope that all these problems can be approached and examined in the debate currently taking place on the Charter of the European Union's fundamental rights. Abroad, I believe that the majority of the points we have included in our resolution provides a fairly faithful view of reality and does not motivate, Mr President, to optimism, as aspects such as those of the abolition of the last sentence, torture that still apply to many countries,Clear, visible and effective. In my opinion, this resolution contains a number of basic points, but I will dwell on a very special point, which is the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations. Mr President, in a world like today's, which is more dominated by the phenomenon of internationalization, and not only in the financial sector, we must provide formed and coordinated answers in order to be effective. In order to achieve this effectiveness in our action, it is necessary to apply a coordination to practice that does not exist today. For this reason, this House defends the principle of reading in the Human Rights Committee and in other international steps in which these issues are being examined and, Mr Council Presidents, this House would like to be able to participate as soon as possible in such meetings."	el
It is for this reason that the Commission presented in November 1998 a proposal for a directive on the information-consultation of workers.We thank the Parliament for the support he has given to this proposal since that time.Unfortunately, more than a year after the presentation of the proposal, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has still not started working on this proposal.I hope that this debate will help remind Member States the importance and urgency of this initiative.We recently heard the Portuguese presidency declare that a serious debate would soon be launched on this proposal.The next presidency, which will be exercised by France, also seems willing to grant this file the priority it deserves.The Commission sincerely hopes that the Parliament and the Council will quickly finalize this important file which constitutes, in its eyes, the most effective response to the concerns raised by cases such as that which brings us here today.Regarding the involvement of employees at the transnational level, there are certain indications of at least one case of infringement of transnational agreements in terms of consultation and information concluded between companies and European work.The companies concerned may have taken part of certain ambiguities of the legal and contractual framework in force.The commission will contact the relevant national authorities to see what it is.In any case, I would like to make anyone who believes they have been flouted in their rights that they have the appropriate means of enforcing the law and obtaining compensation, in particular through relevant national jurisdictional bodies.The Commission heard the request of the Parliament to carry out an immediate revision of the European Business Committees Directive.As indicated by the report it will adopt in the coming weeks, the Commission admits that the directive presents certain shortcomings.Nevertheless, as my colleague has already pointed out, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, on various other occasions, the decision to immediately revise a directive is not easily taken.It depends on various considerations.First, a revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the parties continues to be applied.Then, an immediate revision would risk delaying the progress of other pending files in this area, such as that of the European Anonymous Company and the proposal on national information-consultation.The success of these other files could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the CEE directive and even bring some possibilities of solution to the problems identified above.This is why the Commission thinks rather that it would be better, in this context, to revise the directive on European corporate committees after having completed these two other files and after having evaluated the application of the directive.The revision does not stop at legislation alone.To encourage and support dialogue, as a cornerstone of a successful change, the Commission is putting into practice the recommendations of the Lillehammer report by preparing the creation of a European industrial change observatory.	fr
The districts in which these people live should benefit from these projects.If we succeed in three priorities with our determination, then I think that these families, these people, these European citizens will believe more in Europe, and this is ultimately crucial, because the cities play an increasing role in European life.Mr President, before my colleagues Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou have their say - after all, we had all three that we are responsible for these four community initiatives, the opportunity to pursue the debate with the same attention - I would like to devote myself to Urban and Interreg.Many of them spoke to this topic and commented on it.First of all, I would like to express the rapporteurs of the committees, all committees, but also to the speakers of the political groups and each and each of them for the quality of their contributions and the interest in these two initiatives.This applies in particular to the explanations of Ms. Arlene McCarthy to Urban, and I would like to express my thanks not only for her work and the report she presented, but also, and why should I not mention this too, for what we owe to her, as well as for what we are generally owe to her parliament.I will not forget that the European Parliament will maintain this initiative to renew the crisis -related districts and to promote permanent urban development, which at the same time comprises and desired the integrated approach to cope with the economic, social and ecological problems.There is also agreement, as Ms. Arlene McCarthy explained in her report, with regard to the effectiveness of this instrument, which results from the financial concentration and the critical mass for the interventions, with regard to the horizontal mechanism, which in our opinion is particularly suitable for the spread of the results and the intensification of the exchange of experiences and proven procedures, and finally the growing importance of local authoritiesthe program development and implementation based on a solid partnership.After I remember the matches between the commission's proposals and their parliament and pointed out the interest with which I have followed the contributions, I would like to go into some expressed reviews and suggestions and apologize in advance not to be able to mention any speaker personally.I am still convinced that everyone recognizes each other.First of all, I would like to go into the Urban program and its upper limit of 50 cities, which some of them described as arbitrary.I can understand your concerns.Therefore, I have instructed my departments to adapt to a reasonable increase in the number of cities that are eligible in the context of urban.This requires certain guarantees regarding the concentration - I think especially of 10,000 inhabitants - and the critical financial mass in exceptional areas: We have to remain at 500 euros per inhabitant so that the intervention of the European Union is also effective and visible and is not perceived as a distribution according to the watering can principle that citizens and communities can no longer be able to understand.	de
"Nonetheless, this strategy preparing a shared island of Cyprus is related to a major political challenge. In my opinion, the role of the European Union is to use all the tools and also this to provide a political solution to the island. In this context, I have to say that it is this very important review of the European Parliament. Even the speakers of the Commission and the Council representing the wishes today. I am very pleased to think about things in the same way. I think the primary option is to really connect Cyprus to a member of the European Union by signing a peace agreement. Mr President, forgive me to interfere with the debate, but the French interpretation department made a small interpretation error that is related to what a member Alyssandrakis just said of one of the most sensitive word in the whole debate. I wouldn't want it to be unclear. In France, a member of Alyssandrakis was interpreted that ""the Federation of States is the best solution"". It is clear that a member of Alyssandrakis said: ""Federal is the best solution"". Mr President, it is very important that this is made clear. Many thanks for the rectification, member Wurtz. Mr President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from the countries of continental European. Maltese, in particular, have been able to cope very well in geographically and politically hostile. Their success has been largely due to their entrepreneurship, activity and flexibility. Malta has a lively light and heavy industry, growing financial services, good agriculture, excellent tourism and surprisingly many job opportunities, all of this on an island that is practically without resources. As a result, I am convinced that the Maltese -like island with 340,000 inhabitants cannot adapt to the strict financial and legal structures of the continental population a thousand times. Thus, when I look at the proposed instrument, I did not come up with a way to bring these two people noticed. Rather, the situation resembles a black hole in space, which absorbs the masses so strongly that even the light cannot escape. We should not bribe the people of these islands to collaborate on their own destruction or give them funds to adopt laws that are as foreign to their culture as a black hole in the mother country. The EU should leave Cyprus and Malta alone. It seems to me that no one other than a political class in Malta is supported by this project, and I keep my fingers crossed for the Maltese people to be the winner again. Mr President, this is one of the few times when in Parliament, the views of all tackle colleagues show the great convergence of the views on the Cyprus issue and, of course, the procedure for coordinating Cyprus and Malta. This means that we are all aware of a political problem called Cyprus. At the same time, however, this means that the power of all European parties and peoples gives the Council and the Commission greater power and increases their political power to deal with this problem. Helsinki marked a historical turning point and a reference point. If someone for some reason considers that the balance achieved there is a starting point for new negotiations anywhere else, if some, with their own attitude, undermine this entity and balance, they will make a great mistake. The situation is ripe. The Commission, the Council, and everyone are required to continue to follow the Tempoitta accession negotiations from Cyprus and Malta - which are ultimately the most mature of all members of the members - to give this determination to any party whose views may differ from what we all agree with. Brok's report is a good tool for this purpose, and it is really a bit annoying that as there is a joint debate, political content is determined by the political position of the Council and the Commission, and we cannot say more about this good report."	fi
That's right. We cannot simply focus on the new economy. We have to pay attention to the old. I look forward to hearing more details on the European map of micro -business - it should be very interesting to present it. One of the priorities specified under the Cardiff process is to improve the sensitivity of financial markets to the value of intangible investments and investment in knowledge. This has been achieved, possibly surpassing the boldest dreams of people a few months ago. It can be found in the stunning growth of Europe's stock markets in the value of dot.com companies, and very recently in major changes in the FTSE 100 composition in London. I can't help but think that, although these values ​​have been soaked and we may expect a significant decline in them, the deeper structural change in our economies will remain. Mr President of the Council, you brought the air of renewal here to the European Parliament. All of us can only hope that the Extraordinary Summit will be able to meet the high expectations we have from it. Because, as you have already emphasized, we do not need one process again after another, one method after another, we need much more acts by which the population of the European Union will evaluate the benefit and value of the European Union's action. In this respect you justifiably linked employment, economic reform, growth and social cohesion to a single issue, which has made it a matter of paramount importance. It is very important that all governments and committee agents to gather their strength in the same direction, the direction of full -time employment. Then it will be possible to persuade all the protagonists of economic policy about the necessity of coordinated behavior, which is unfortunately not exists to date. Europe is not allowed to mourn either for the success of the US economy or the powerful dollar, but to teach it for it. Reforms in financial services, services capital and work markets are certainly beneficial and necessary. But they will not give themselves the necessary impulse to growth to plan a sustainable and effective high -level development for employment. In the '90s we had to experience this failure multiple. When we have an average growth rate of 2%, we need a 3.5% growth rate to be able to achieve full employment over ten years. Ten years it's not too long. For this reason, full employment must indeed be put in the first place on the agenda. We need to set a growth goal of at least 3%. The goal of full employment cannot be achieved only through economic policy. The Europe of Innovation and Information Society must also serve this goal. And from this we are still far from today. We must also understand that we need another form of economic and economic management. Decisions on jobs, the economy, the development of stock prices of the shares are not allowed exclusively in the hands of the various shareholders and the Board of Directors of the public limited companies.	el
"Please think about it. Mr President, I admit that I have room to become smarter. Mr Swoboda, these margins apply to both of us. Lord, you are in a key problem related to the way we set this in our regulation. When these amendments have been tabled in the deadline, in accordance with the Regulation, they are announced and treated in accordance with the procedure by the President. Mr. SPERONI on the process. Mr President, I don't know if it's a translation issue, but his colleague said ""Technical Team of Racists"": We are the technical team of independent.. Mr. colleague, this was certainly a translation problem. I am absolutely convinced. Report (A5-0055/2000) by Mr Belder, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, on the European Commission's announcement on the treatment of racism, xenophobia and anti -Semitism in the candidates for integration (COM) 256 - C5.1999/2099 (COS)) (The House approves the resolution.- C5-0063/2000 - 2000/2034 (COS)) (the body approves the resolution.) Mr President, voted against the report because I do not judge a bottle of wine based on its label, but based on its content. This exhibition, although labeling the fight against racism, but its content is an indisputable construct full of ideological confusion and is not worthy of its title. The report cannot be improved and I warn the body not to continue to be ridiculed by similar irrational reports, as the issue of combating racism is very important to offer the ground for some of the ideological alumni. Although we do not agree with much of the causal thoughts of the report on the fight against racism and xenophobia, we have voted in favor of this report because it takes a stand against discrimination and in favor of minorities. However, we do not agree with the satisfaction expressed by parliament for this report. First, because most of the proposals in favor of minorities or immigrants remain unclear and are not binding. Then, due to hypocrisy, one is presented as the defender of immigrants and minorities at a time when, in his own country, a policy is practiced against immigrants, even in the form of the pursuit of illegal immigrants. Finally, the report does not consider the deeper economic and social reasons that facilitate the incitement of people by the demagogues of racist and xenophobic farm, and especially the importance of unemployment and the deterioration of poverty for an increasing part of the population. Mr President, I take the floor on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party team, to explain our abstention from the vote, which in this case is a clear position, although abstinence normally does not represent a position. We were absent because, on the one hand, we agree with the symbolic idea and principles of fighting racism and xenophobia, because some parts of this exhibition contain important statements. To mention only two, I will mention paragraph 8, which relates to the functions of the European Observatory for racism and xenophobia or paragraph 24, which calls on the Member States in this fight for certain very specific issues."	el
If we increase consistency through a model analysis, we share the best practices and improve strategic cooperation and coordination, the EU can be an important factor in liberating new economic dynamics. Too much of the European market is still too decentralized. Too few European small and medium -sized companies get to the top of their field. There are too few entrepreneurs in Europe. There is too little entrepreneurship in Europe. Mr. Prime Minister, you yourself have pointed out that there is too little risk capital in the European capital market. We do too little research and development work at both the individual Member States and the Union. Even so little is reflected in market products and services. Lisbon's challenge is to outline policy and methods to remedy these shortcomings and to release this possible dynamics. This would indeed be a matter of enabling. Being able to give people jobs is our best weapon in combating social exclusion. This new model must also definitely be human -centered, and it must look at the concept of lifelong learning, invest in flexibility through education and vocational education, and invest in self -development and individual opportunities. Member of Barón Crespo described it as a Social Democratic project. I would rather call it an enlightened liberal project. Within the limits of budget and healthy macroeconomic policy - I emphasize them, as is the President Prodi - our European social models, in a sense, provide a safety net. However, passive dependence on social security is not enough for many marginalized and long -term unemployed, young, women and other marginalized groups. It's a trap. We need to release this new dynamics at the individual level by saying that resources exist even within a healthy monetary economy. However, they are used passively. They need to be transformed into active well -being models that encourage all nail people to act and protect those who are unable to do so. We can best ensure the fight against unemployment and to promote Europe's social cohesion through the economy and sustainable welfare models that are rich in jobs. Finally, I would say from the information society that it is quite clear that we need to change our way of thinking not only on technological but also on a social level. It is quite clear that we need to transform old social expenditure into new economic and social opportunities. We need to get rid of the policies and methods that have led to a second generation of Europeans in the world. We can do it if we allow Europe and its citizens to use their entire potential. If Lisbon reaches the goals mentioned today, it will be an important step on the way to the release of the dynamics I mentioned. Mr. Prime Minister, like you and the Presidential State Portugal, would like to believe that Europe has to be built as a civilization whose economic and social flourishing is based on raising the value of knowledge and skills, cultural diversity and belonging, and is in an active part of promoting a more balanced, peaceful and solid world order. We would also like to believe in your way that there is a clear and unanimous awareness that the extent of their changes, which should be prepared for the necessary skills, in order to meet the new technical challenges of companies, also includes the risk of new social exclusion processes, as you said. We would like to believe this, but we can't. Why not? Because we know that a new kind of economy will allow for new design and information technology jobs. We note the feverish movement in which more and more people consider the work of an investor and where the phenomenon of SMEs expands, but we also know the turnover that is characterized by telephone centers because of the terrible working conditions that prevail in these new Taylor system and hundreds of employees. We know that more than half of the jobs currently trusted in the European Union are uncertain, temporary and part-time, which is not in accordance with the wishes of those working in these workplaces, and that these jobs do not guarantee the prerequisites for personal independence for job holders and often their proper livelihood.	fi
"Nonetheless, I would like to thank the rapporteur Bertel Haarder for his warm investment and constructive cooperation I have experienced with him as a shadow presenter of the European Social Democratic Party. Discussions with him have deepened my view of the complexity of this issue, and I also want to give public value here, above all, to his open attitude. When it comes to the content of the report, I want to briefly mention a few topics. Isn't it really ironic that asylum and immigration issues, which are one of the most important priorities in Europe, have received so much positive response in this report? Shouldn't the European approach to asylum and immigration matters really should just lead to a reduction in human rights violations in this area? The questions already contain an answer. We also need alertness to respect the human rights of large -scale European minorities. People in these groups who are often in an economically vulnerable position are in great danger of being victims of discrimination. The reality is that millions of people live in our rich and privileged Europe. The report describes these problems of poverty and retardation as a human right, which I think is a step forward in the debate. The report also focuses more on the equal treatment of women and men in previous years and to the equal treatment of different relationships and lifestyles. The free choices that people make in their private life and do not harm to anyone else, should be accepted in respect of diversity and guarantee the principle of equal treatment. As shown in a few checks, the battle on this issue is nowhere near the end. Mr President, there are still many who, including in this parliament, as shown in the debate - want to give priority to marriage and family, and thus also offend and discriminate openly to anyone who makes a different choice in their private life. On the other hand, my group considers the principle of equality to be the most important. Human rights are for everyone..(DA) Mr President, I would like to thank for the support given to the main lines of this report. After all, human rights are about things that are common to us, regardless of party boundaries and the boundaries of the states, and therefore it is important that Parliament can reach a widespread agreement on human rights, because no lawsuit can be global if half of the parliament opposes it. I would especially like to thank the member of Parliament Swiebel for both today's friendly words and for the close cooperation we have done and, of course, had a significant impact. I would like to say to him that I would be happy to support his additional checks we will vote for tomorrow. However, I would also like to thank the member Pirker and the member Palacio. I would like to thank for the extensive agreement on this report. I consider it a good thing, especially this year, when human rights are so highlighted in the European Union. Finally, I would like to tell a member Krerup that he should forget the joy he expressed due to the change in paragraph 61, for it is a pure mistake. Ten words have been omitted from the Danish version. If he reads the English version, he will see how the point should be. Mr President, China is criticized for the reports under discussion. I agree to this criticism, even though I will take the risk of being the risk of being in protest letter from Beijing to ask whether the European Parliament is against China's hostile campaign. Raising the reports of the rapporteur Malmström and the rapporteur Harder, I can firmly say, ""No, we do not campaign against China, but are campaign for human rights - everywhere.""The reports will criticize about twenty non -European countries and almost all EU states and candidate states. I really think about sending reports to the People's Congress, who gathered in Beijing, their EU Committee, and suggest them to do something similar. Why would the People's Congress not produce a self -critical story of China's human rights and a story about the human rights of the world and the EU, from a Chinese perspective?"	fi
"It is also about very specific things like transport capacities.These things must be coordinated faster in the European Union.Another example: the big cattle death in Mongolia.We know that Tacis and Echo Gelder are present in the European Union.But why don't we help?Because there are too many bureaucratic obstacles.The foreign representation of the European Union must better take our needs in a stronger future European foreign policy.In short, the focus is on the operational implementation.Relationships with Russia are very important.We must not be behind the criticism of the Chechnya policy of Russia.To our extraordinary regret, we have to find out that the freedom of the press in Russia has not yet been guaranteed.We had invited the journalist Babitzki to us for next Thursday, but the Russian authorities did not leave him out.I hope that the European Commission, on the other hand, has energetic protest from the Russian authorities.President, Mr. President of the Commission, if a parliament debates priorities in the legislative process, everything becomes priority.For me there are the most important priorities in employment and thus in economic growth, as well as in quality of life and thus in environmental protection, in food safety and consumer rights.I would now like to make some explanations about the economic and social area.One of the initiatives of the Commission, which is a high priority, is the E-Europe initiative.We debated Europe's economic and social renewal yesterday about the summit in Lisbon.In doing so, I asked for common growth goals so that we can achieve full employment.Full employment does not mean the complete end of all forms of unemployment, because economic unemployment, employees who want to change the position, young people who are looking for an initial will always exist.However, full employment has been achieved if there is no longer a long -term unemployed if each young person is at least offered a training opportunity six months after entering the labor market.This is possible if we invest more in what Mr. Guterres described yesterday as ""human capital"", i.h.in basic training and then above all in the lifelong training.In this context, the E-Europe initiative is just right.In the future, the jobs will have an increasing computer science component.But in this area we lack experts, as in the USA.Therefore, the American Senate has approved a total of 500,000 visas within a period of four years for highly qualified foreign workers.We have to train our own experts and ensure that they stay in Europe.In a commission document it has been found that half of the young academics who complete a postgraduate degree in the USA will stay there.In order to keep our experts here to attract the best experts to train more, we have to invest massively in research and development.The only two countries that invest a larger part of their GDP in research and development than the USA, i.e.h.Finland and Sweden are also the only two European countries that can compete with the Americans in the area of ​​communication technologies.That would be an example to which the other European countries could follow!"	de
During the tripartite dialogue of October 6, 1999 in Strasbourg, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission approved the idea of ​​rapidly concluding that agreement. We believe that we respected that commitment, which has however made it relatively easy because of the climate of trust and mutual respect that characterized the whole negotiation with the Commission. The points dealt with by the agreement are essentially two: on the one hand, the information of the European Parliament, which is the Sine Qua Non prerequisite for the actual exercise of the right to intervene under Article 8 of the Decision. This information was made so far on paper and in a non -systematic way, which was responsible for parliament itself, and useless for our services. From now on, the information will be guaranteed by an electronic system called Circa, in which the European Parliament will have access and which is a true innovation not only for us but also for the committee, which I am sure. On the other hand, Article 8 of the Council's Decision does not specify either the method or the time -limit on the basis of which the European Parliament must sound the alarm, that is to say, to exercise its limited control power. Paragraphs 6 and 7 of the Agreement adopt that the European Parliament generally approves its reasoned resolution at a Polomelia meeting and that it has one month to use its right to intervene prior to the approval of the executive plan by the Commission. It is not always possible to expect one month before applying an executive rule, as we all know. The agreement therefore provides for an urgent procedure, which provides for the possibility of activating the committee responsible. In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that, in order to evaluate whether it is or is not a good deal, we should expect to see it work in practice. The European Parliament should acquire means that it does not currently have, in order to ensure an effective continuation of the executive process and a real control, and the Commission should accept the reorganization of some of its practices to ensure an effective control and real information to Parliament. Finally, we must remember, however, that, in any case, for the European Parliament the real solution to the problems of commissionology remains the amendment of the procedure provided for by the conditions for the implementation of the rules, as well as the progressive dismantling of the committees whose existence is an abnormality that can significantly reduce the executive and executive. Mr President, dear colleagues, Committee is a concept that says nothing to most people and only a few know what it means. It is reminiscent of secret companies and conspiracies, so it was older. But behind this word there is nothing other than the determining of the terms of the executive responsibilities assigned to the Commission. The terms of exercise of these executive responsibilities consist of a limited number of procedures through committees.	el
The fixed point remains.The fixed point is the means.Well, you stand here in front of a parliament, of which some members still live in the memory of what I would like to describe it, that is, white book syndrome, that is, the great initiative of Jacques Delors that failed on the bookholders of the Ecofin Council.We do not want them to move the same misfortune today, because the project they propose is so promising that he can do a thrust and that Europe can offer those from our colleague Goebbel's future perspective.However, they need the necessary funds that, as I fear, will be missing a little today.So your task is to get the necessary funds, but this will not be possible within the narrow framework of the Agenda 2000.So you will have to make your colleagues take care of the financing of the suggestions that you will submit to us.An example among many - and this is one of the important measures you have proposed - concerns the information and knowledge society.Without a doubt - and you have explained this clearly - the social gap is an essential problem that we have to fight.Digital gap must not be added as I would like to describe them.Who do you want to offer this information and knowledge society?An increasingly older or older population, a population that is still poor despite everything, and an unfortunately less and less well -trained population?So you have to start at the base if this knowledge society is not to be limited to the profit striving for some successful start-ups that are absolutely necessary.But that is probably not the goal they pursue.Unfortunately, an area is missing in your program, namely the public services.Public services have played an important role in the history of our European social model.Today we no longer live in the time of the monopolis, and the commission has initiated a process of liberalization in a number of public sectors to open to the competition in order to modernize them and make them more efficient.However, we must not stop.Now it has to be determined more precisely what the most important public service tasks will exist in this context of the competition and the information society, which are to be fulfilled by the state and private companies of this sector.In this regard, more sustainable measures are required, which are not yet included in the commission's work program, which they could give an impetus: In my opinion, an extremely important signal would be set.This knowledge society is finally based on research and development, and at this point I would like to welcome the initiative taken by the Commission to create a European research area.However, the Commission and Parliament need the advice so that this European research area can be equipped with the necessary means.The supporting program is not enough, it must be further equipped and changed in its most important objectives.This is an extensive work, but we rely on you.President, Mr. Council President, Mr President, Dear colleagues!President of the Council, they spoke of a political deficit.	de
Like previous years of previous years, this year's work program does not justify each of the many new proposed actions.15 Page -long overall compatibility is not a sufficient justification for 500 initiatives mentioned in the Annex. In the future, Eldr intends to adhere to clear reasoning and specialized parliamentary debate on the requirement of all the actions reported in the work program. In particular, we want evidence that each new proposal has been properly weighed on the basis of the principle of subsidiary and proportionality, and we look forward to sectoral discussions in the European Parliament's own fields. In other words, it is now time to take a thorough review of our outdated way of developing this crucial important program document and how we will discuss it in the future. Mr President, I would like to thank the chairman of the Commission for having two speeches for us within 24 hours. In his speech last night, he clearly pointed out that the economic outlook for the next two or three years is inexpensive for us in Europe, and it is clear that in the preparation of an annual legislative program, we help us to grow much faster than expected. The speech of the chairman of the Commission made me think about three things. The first one relates to secondaryity, and our group strongly believes, as the liberals recently stated that we must have a justification for each individual proposal presented, and it must be revealed that it is in the interests of the Union. It must be shown that the subsidiary applies: it must be clear that we do not adjust the laws if it is not necessary to adjust them. The other relates to budgets. As growth has been faster than predicted in financial outlook, as they are based on an increase of 2.5 %, we could in the future use slightly different actions in our budget instead of the actions we would otherwise have taken. On behalf of my group, I would like to warn the Commission not to change agricultural expenditure from expenditure to 1 expenditure at this stage to 4 expenditure to 4. Especially in the UK, the situation of agriculture is extremely bad, and some support in the industry would need some agricultural areas: if the money for agriculture would be transferred from one part to another at this stage. Finally, a reminder of the information flow. This is the relationship between the Parliament and the previous Commission: that is, the fact that, under basic agreements, we can, in principle, access to all documents and we are also entitled to it. It seems that we are getting into trouble because of our framework agreement. That is why I would emphasize that we need to find a solution to this problem as quickly as possible and not to restrict documents that citizens can get to know if we want the Commission and Parliament to work together. As Member Bonde rightly emphasized, in the European Union, information should freely flow from the administration to citizens. Mr President of the Commission, when you entered the office, you said that openness would launch the Commission's activities. So many have said here today. But what is the situation today? Why are the Commission's press events no longer broadcast live via a satellite TV to keep track of Europe as a whole? I hope the prodi listens. Commission chairman, Prodi, a letter to the Ombudsman you sent to the President Fontaine. Do you indeed believe that the Odi President is bound by a principle that he or she should set the cooperation between the institutions as the starting point for his or her work. What do you consider to be your claim as a legal basis and do you think that such a principle can defeat the right of the Ombudsman freely to the press? In addition, I would like to provide the next factual information on your audience posting in the Wall Street Journal, where you indicate that the openness seminar in April is proof that the regulation has been prepared openly. This seminar was actually organized by the European Federation of Journalists, including Members of Parliament Lööw, Thors and Hautala, but the proposal discussed there is nothing to do with this current proposal. The latter proposal has been prepared very secret.	fi
Particularly with regard to my country, Finland, where in many cases we are pre -registered in terms of networking in relation to our other European partners, the goals are overly moderate. The initiative will also increase future challenges, even for the progressed countries of information society. Dear Mr. Commissioner, I appreciate the generous efforts you have made on information society. Neither do we, MPs in the European Parliament, can simply follow Europe from the forefront of the internet world against those who create challenges worldwide. Europe's clear global superiority in wireless communication is not enough to eliminate concern about the future of the European Information Society and whether we can really watch the competition. The key to the creation of the European Information Society is being facilitated by the essential competition in telecommunications networks. Competition reduces expenditure and we should be precisely the costs of communication, so that consumers and media can take full advantage of the electronic revolution. Along with the reduction in spending, the prerequisite for the development of e -commerce is to be able to resolve any issue of safety in a satisfactory manner for consumers, as well as to fill the legislative gaps in the case. I consider particularly important measures to increase high -risk capital in the state -of -the -art technology. The € 20 billion currently available in Europe for high risk capital corresponds only to a quarter of those available in the US. The amount is too small. Fortunately, however, in this case the Commission took the initiative and drew our attention to acceleration of growth. The ever -increasing development of information society is decisively changing our environment and our working and living conditions. We, as European legislators, have to face a truly great challenge if we intend to express the spirit of the time. The legislator does not always have to intervene in growth, in some cases industry and bodies can find a quick solution to their problems with cooperation. As an example, we can mention the positive experiences we have gained by the common standardization of second -generation mobile systems, which are now directly revealed by increasing competitiveness in the third generation. Managing the new environment of activity also requires the educational systems to increase technical and pedagogical readiness. For this reason, in European educational programs we should also focus more on our attention on the training of teaching staff. Finally, I would like to point out that I support the application of benchmarking on the development of information society. Regarding the other specific proposals presented in the EEUROPE announcement, I can only wonder, because all of this had not been examined earlier in the Council, in order to ensure the commitment of the Member States..(It) Mr President, in the context of the Commission's announcement on information society, I think it is particularly important to emphasize the emphasis on the need to be new technologies accessible to all European citizens.	el
We need common, interregional and transnational organs in which all local and regional bodies as well as all economic and social actors are actively involved.Parallel projects that are developed on both sides of the border must no longer exist.We have to create a cross -border culture, and in the area of ​​administrative cooperation, innovative concepts are necessary with which the existing limits and the difficulties can be overcome due to the different regulations of responsibilities in the individual member states, regions and municipalities.It must not happen that a project cannot be carried out due to communication problems.In the discussion in the committee, we also found that there are problems to coordinate Interreg with other financing instruments such as Meda, Tacis or Phares that run over a year or two.In his draft decision, the parliament attaches great importance to the fact that these problems are solved, it submits solutions to the Commission and sets reasonable deadlines to carry out the necessary changes.Mr. President, the reason for my speech in this pronunciation can be seen in the fact that the urban initiative is quite successful, especially in Ireland.Therefore, I am very vehemently advocated that the European Union continues its contribution in this area.It is a sad fact that hundreds, if not thousands of communities in the European Union, have to suffer from extreme poverty and disadvantage.Even in very wealthy Member States and large cities, a variety of people in ghettos live under inadequate living conditions, the level of education is low, the physical infrastructure is underdeveloped, and drug addiction and everything that is related.I believe that the European Union must support the Member States to prove that it can be helpful in the support of European citizens, and also that the Union is doing something for these citizens and their families.The program was extremely successful in Ireland, and of course I also know about his success in other countries.In the beginning you only progressed with small steps, and this slowness moved that it was necessary to have the local population developed these programs yourself.It is very important that you incorporate your own initiative and your own expertise on the local conditions into the development of this initiative.It would be very easy to have these programs worked out quickly and on time by external specialists, but this approach would question the whole meaning of the urban program.Before I come to the end, I would like to address another point: We should insist that where the funds flow and where this program is worked out, everything is done in the context of a serious development policy under Urban.Unfortunately, this is not the case in Ireland.I welcome the innovative approach of the Equal program and the aim of integrating discriminated population groups into the labor market.I think the development partnerships are a very clever concept, even if they have experimental character.However, I have two important concerns about the development partnerships.They should also be made accessible to smaller groups so that they can develop, implement and monitor the programs.We need a high degree of flexibility for this program.In the past, I have repeatedly pointed out that a simple language must be used instead of technical jargon so that intelligibility is guaranteed for everyone.	de
The truth is that women's minor participation in political representatives and decision -making means an inappropriate democracy deficiency with true democracy. Therefore, it is essential to implement the various equality directives, and therefore, the Council, the Commission and each Member State must determine, in particular, the commitments he or she has adopted at the Beijing Conference. Mr President of the Council, a Member of the Commission, I represent the right, but I am working with my colleagues to help and support our citizens in their efforts to gain power and decision -making. The battle must be done not only in politics but also in all sectors of society. I would just say that significant tasks can be achieved in many different ways, and the fact that I especially oppose quotas - which I think are particularly degrading to women - is due to the fact that I have a new gender equality law. That is, it is very logical and consistent that I oppose quotas! That law should have been enacted long ago, as more than half of the members of society are women, so I think it is quite normal that at least half - if not more - women work at the top of decision -making and in politics alongside others. Thus, I do not accept discriminatory measures that require women to be involved in decision -making. Women know how to demand enough themselves because they have a sense of practicality and make sense. When women in politics are required to have vocational training, I would like to say that no, at least not. We can demand vocational training in politics for male and female candidates, but why demand it especially for women? Then we would admit that women are inferior than men. But as far as I know, we have never felt worse than men, at least not in politics. So we are doing these battles because we can help our citizens gain decision -making power and get involved in political responsibilities, but I think this can only be done through a sharp change in attitude. Together, we have to be strong enough to be able to bend our political responsible person to their own initiative to demand women involved in political decision -making..(SV) Mr President, Mr Media, Member of the Commission, Women support half heaven, once said a successful man. However, when making important decisions and priorities, women's voices are not heard. Women with more than half of the population are clearly under -represented in political, economic and social sectors. It is impossible to accept in democracy! In equality issues, the gap between the statutory statement and reality is nothing deeper than in decision-making. In order to get a level weight, a concrete action plan with a specific schedule is needed. An important part of such a plan is the model analysis system, which ensures that women have a full opportunity to participate in power structures and decision-making. I am therefore pleased that a member of the Commission is positive about such a system. I suggest that the EU objectives concerning the position of women in decision -making are based on an average, which is calculated in each field on the basis of the situation in the three most successful Member States, and that Member States draw up annual reports. After that, these stories need to be evaluated. Women are primarily victims of human rights violations, such as rape, sexual abuse, domestic violence and human trafficking, but are underdog in those legal and legislative bodies that give judgment on these crimes. It follows that these crimes are considered minor and the perpetrators are often not accused. Women are primarily victims of armed conflicts, but they do not get their voice in key decisions on peacekeeping, conflict resolution and reconstruction. Therefore, in the resolution, we urge Member States to increase the proportion of women in all activities related to conflict and peace safeguard. Equal participation in women in decision-making is not just based on the demand of social justice and democracy, it is also essential in order to fully utilize women's experiences and skills.	fi
The sixth report of the European Commission draws very precious conclusions.I will summarize two, which have already been recalled by the rapporteur, one positive, the other negative.The first is that significant progress has been made in terms of territorial and social cohesion throughout the territory of the Union and that the community funds have played an important, although not decisive role, in the reduction of regional inequalities.The negative is that the considerable effort that has been made has proven more effective with regard to bringing together the GDP and productivity of European regions than in terms of its employment levels.It is therefore necessary to better coordinate structural financing and the creation of workstations.It is, Mr. Commissioner, the first mandate for the next period.I therefore ask, Mr. President, to my illustrious colleagues to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as did other colleagues, that it does not lose sight of the conclusions of its sixth periodic report with regard to the programming of the period 2000-2006.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and also for the way in which the amendments' proposals were taken into consideration during the committee exam.The sixth periodic report provides a basis on which to assess the achievement of the European Union regional policy.The report shows that, despite all the efforts, the growth is uneven.Extremely rapid growth continues in central Europe.Likewise, the most dynamic centers are constantly growing faster than the European average, while many regions in the north and southern Europe experience significantly slower growth.An in -depth analysis of the reasons which make regional policy not give the expected results in all regions is now necessary.Is the reason for bureaucracy?Or the regional disparities - distances, too hot or too cold climate, dispersed habitat, rigorous conditions - have not taken enough taken into account?How can the European Union face the challenges of evolution on the planetary scale so that the less well developed regions can keep pace?It would also be important to analyze the effects of expansion on structural funds and the development of the most remote regions.Member States also have their share of responsibility in this area and they must not forget it.Some Member States have contravened the principle of subsidiarity and reduced regional resources to the national level, while the regional aid provided by the European Union was increasing.This had a harmful effect on the results of regional policy.It will also be necessary to think in the future of setting up indicators to target the measures at the right time and in the right place.For example, the uncontrolled migratory flow was not sufficiently taken into account.In this regard too, there is reason to emphasize the decisive role of SMEs as suppliers of jobs and engines of regional development.It is particularly important to put new technologies and know-how available to companies in developing regions.Our group is favorable to the adoption of this report.Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, the territorial policy of the European Community has so far made it possible to significantly translate the residents of income of the inhabitants.	fr
Tomorrow, when we accept the minutes of today's session, those colleagues who think that something is not well explained may request changes. I think this is a good way. Of course, the minutes of the tomorrow's session takes into account all the supplementary explanations. I believe this is a better way than to start the time -consuming voting explanations now. Member of Cox and Member Häsch, is this suitable for you? Mr President, if the minutes are correctly recorded in how my group voted, I do not intend and I can't resist it. If your decision is that I cannot give voting explanation, I accept it, but with certain reservations. So we are going to draw up the minutes very closely. That's what we really always do. If the positions do not appear properly in the minutes, we may correct this if necessary.(The order of the processing was confirmed as modified.) The following is the report on the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism (A5-0105/1999) by Koch's Dangerous Survey Safety Adviser.minimum requirements.(C5-0208/1999 1998/0106 (COD))..(De) Member of the Commission, Mr President, Dear Colleagues, I openly and without a vision of the Council's common position on the minimum requirements for a degree in the safety of dangerous materials, rail and inland transport. First of all, we were forced to formally take action to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC, which obliges Member States to appoint and provide the transportation of dangerous substances and provide teaching, training and qualification for these persons without clearly defining these activities. Secondly, with this Directive, we achieve the fact that (a) safety increases both in the transport and re -level of hazardous substances, (b) the distortion of competition from a variety of national education structures and costs, and c) we create an equal position for security advisers on the European labor market. Thirdly, we secure this Directive, as it is now presented in a common position, a low number of high levels of flexibility and the tough regulations of the European Union, and promoting the widespread deductible of the Member States, especially because the Directive only applies to minimum requirements. All of this is particularly positive in the spirit of the principle of subsidiary. In my first process, the review proposals we have made in the first process have been commendable. They were approved, their content was changed, or they were launched, as no corresponding European regulations were issued, such as the penalty system, or complicated grouping of the entities. I will consolidate the unanimously approved of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee review for the temporal implementation of the Directive. By abandoning the implementation of a certain period on the implementation of the Directive on the Member States and, on the other hand, granting them, after the entry into force of a three -month period, we will introduce a flexible statement that guarantees the delayed implementation of the Directive. I ask you to accept this check. Mr President, we cannot, and cannot be content with hearing more and more of accidents that cause major damage on roads, railways or waterways, not only, but also because the parties are not serious enough to transport hazardous substances or that a small accident has become a large disaster of different types of transport. As an Austrian and I believe, we all still have a disaster in fresh memory, which last year caused the loss of several lives in the Tauern tunnel, and then had to spend several months and huge amounts to repair what this fire had destroyed in the tunnel. Monthly renovation interrupted this important traffic route between the northern and south of Europe. Rotary traffic caused by the renovation burdened several thousand EU citizens up to the boundaries of tolerance. In some municipalities of my country, there was indeed a damn. Prevention must be our answer to such disasters, and through the proposal to be discussed, we provide an important basis for well -educated people who are responsible for safety issues to be done in time.	fi
Mr President, I am not a friend of Milosevic and his government.Nevertheless, I have great doubts about the legitimization of NATO's mission against Yugoslavia in the Kosovo conflict, on the one hand because of the lack of a decision by the UN Security Council, on the other hand, because I think that this effort could have been avoided if you had not made any unfulfilled demands with regard to the sovereignty of Serbia.Cleaning of Serbs and Roma speaks for itself. Should NATO not at least admit its mistake and take responsibility for the intentional bombing of the Belgrader television station and the death of over 20 civilian journalists, because this is still a difficult moral flaw and may now become a shameful charges against our westernLead state and government heads?Mr. MP!As far as the point of view of the European Union is concerned, there is no selective assessment, interpretation and analysis of what military goals are, in particular the measures against a certain type of infrastructures that served as a support for Mr. Milosevic's political and propaganda system.Therefore, I cannot tell you whether we agreed with a specific NATO campaign or not.They belong to an overall plan that we agree with.Some of these actions may be questionable, and some were even described by NATO as unfortunate.Others can be justified with tactical reasons, i.e.h.You should prevent Mr. Milosevic from continuing his domestic propaganda campaign.In any case, on behalf of the Council, I would not like to hand over any value judgment about a certain NATO act in military areas.Herring Council President, since I am familiar with the history of the Balkans, I would like to remind them that the peoples of Yugoslavia have lived together peacefully for decades.Destabilization began about ten years ago with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a crucial role.The crime of Yugoslavia was the only Balkanland that neither of NATO nor the European Union want to belong.What still stood after the air strikes is now destroyed by the supposedly disarmed, under the eyes of the KFOR, which is becoming increasingly clear as a crew.Every day, new crimes against people who are not Kosovoalbans come to light against the cultural heritage of Kosovo and hundreds of violations of UN Resolution 1244.In my opinion, it would be best to finish the advice of this part of Yugoslavia and looked for a solution that is acceptable for all sides, which respects the ethnic peculiarities of the region, but above all the principle of non -interference in the internal affairs of an independent country.I respect the opinion and knowledge of the MP about the Balkans region, although, to be honest, it is difficult for me to understand the extent to which the special features of the region in terms of political stability can be a solution to the problem.If we look at the democratic stability of the region, one could say that the cause of the current situation in the decay of Yugoslavia can be found.But we do not want to deal with international development here.	de
The other two amendments, namely amendment 18 in the report on self -employed and amendment 21 in the report on non -self -employed, withdraw them. I only appeal to the Presidents' Conference to reach an agreement as soon as possible on how one can correctly refer to the regulation of commissionology. This would make the life of the rapporteurs in the body much easier. De Palacio has also been submitted to both amendment for both reports. Unfortunately I have to say that I cannot support it because it changes the essence of the conclusion we had unanimously reached the Committee on Legal Issues and Internal Markets and I want to remain in the conclusion that after long discussions we came to the Committee. Finally, let me thank all the colleagues who stood by my side of the Committee on Legal Affairs when processing this not so easy exposure. I would like to specifically mention my colleague Wieland, who had the shabby role of the shadow rapporteur and, by far, has exceeded the usual limits, participated in the preparation of the exhibition with very good and constructive ideas without reaping the rapporteur's laurels. Mr President, I am glad to be given the opportunity to make some introductory observations after the rapporteur's intervention, Mr Berger. Then, I will hear the speakers' interventions with great interest and, if you allow me, Mr President, I would like at the end of the discussion to go into more detail in the various amendments. First of all, I would like to say that the Commission is very pleased that the European Parliament supports the two proposals for the free provision of services and employees from third countries, which is also the topic of discussion. I am particularly grateful to Mrs Berger for the work she did when considering these proposals, which concern fine political issues and constitute a legal challenge. I would also like to thank Mrs Palacio for her significant contribution as Chairman of the Committee on Legal Issues and Internal Markets. The Commission is particularly pleased with Parliament's recommendations to establish a more effective process for issuing a service card. The procedure will become even more flexible if it is possible to apply for the issuance of a service card for one or more or for all Member States. The Commission also agrees with the proposal for the establishment of a varying power bulletin. But I am in the opinion that a three -month period of employment is not sufficient as proof to establish an employee in a particular Member State. The Commission may also agree with the establishment of a provision in cases of termination of an employment contract between the service provider and an employee. The introduction of an effective process for issuing the bulletin implies that businesses that offer cross -border services must be able to exercise the rights they own and derive from the internal market. We consider it too much the proposal to give other Member States to carry out systematic checks for the issuance of a publication, with the reasons for public order.	el
Mr President, we will vote for the application for a resolution of the GUE/NGL fraction because he denounces the responsibility of Total-Fina for this ecological disaster, and I advocate the proposal to prohibit female flags and the use of outdated ships or to pretend a double-walled outer skin for oil tankers.Let me add that it would be the least that is totally fully to make up for the reimbursement of the immediate and indirect damage as a result of the oil spill.How do you want to prevent similar disasters in the future if you do not impose draconian measures against the large oil companies, as well as against others who take the risk of making our planet uninhabitable?How should you not outrage if a bank refuses to reveal the name of the owners of the Erika, citing banking secrecy, without the governments being reacted?Basically, the problem lies in the fact that all governments, as well as all European institutions, grant large corporations such as Total Fina and their kind, the right to maximize their profits at the expense of their employees as well as at the expense of the environment.They admit business secret to the companies and the banks, even if this really covers criminal acts.Under these circumstances, even the best resolutions remain only fundamental petitions that are unable to prevent the large corporations from causing damage.President, dear colleagues!I am in favor of tightening the regulations on port state control and the regulations on classification companies.But we also have to stay with the facts.Erika ship has been examined four times in the past two years.It cannot be due to the number of examinations;Rather, it depends on ensuring the intensity of the controls.I have heard in the discussions of the past few weeks: The Member States do not have enough money to carry out the controls!I can't accept that.If the Member States decide together with us, 25 % of the ships are checked on the basis of the port state control, then you must also provide the staff!Then the checks must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector not only goes on board and looks at whether a fire extinguisher is missing somewhere, but then material tests must be carried out, because this ship has obviously broken apart due to material obveting.This can only be determined if the controls are carried out with a large intensity.It should be our goal to ensure that the port states controls are not superficial, but involve the material.Second, I also share the commissioner's hints and would like to encourage her to continue on this way.If it turns out that one or more classification societies have given compliance report, then they should be deleted by the list of permissible classification companies!This is the only deterrent to prevent other classification societies from also submitting a complacence report.Dear colleague Roth-Behrendt, we have the TÜV for ships.The classification companies are the TÜV for the ships!There are also good companies.You know some good companies, our French colleagues know some good companies, but we have to take a close look at which companies do not meet the requirements, and these must be deleted from the list.	de
The freedom of discretion of the state that you address in point e) of your amendment 10 does not seem to me to be consistent with the entire text of your otherwise awarded report.I therefore ask the colleagues to examine my amendment and hope that we can come to a result tomorrow.To the outside world, these two proposals seem to introduce certain procedures to promote freedom of movement in Europe and to implement the recent judgments that Ms. Berger spoke in their introductory comments.In the event of the United Kingdom, however, we believe that they also go beyond and are therefore unacceptable.This applies partly to the content, but sometimes also to the legal basis in relation to the special position of the United Kingdom.According to the agreements included in the contract, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.The system proposed in these legal texts stipulates that citizens from third countries who want to come to the United Kingdom in accordance with the procedures described present the service ID issued by another Member State and thereby bypass the border controls of the United Kingdom.If there are changes to the current border control regulations of the United Kingdom, then these changes should be brought about by the government and the parliament of the United Kingdom and not a passerby about the European legal law.For this reason, we will vote against these two proposals.President, Lord, ladies and gentlemen!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the colleague Wieland for the trouble to summarize the various amendments and the various interests in this report.These two proposals significantly contribute to the implementation of one of the four core principles of the internal market for freedom of service.The new regulation for cross-border services will undoubtedly improve both the functioning of the internal market as well as the company's ability to compete and act.The strict framework for the creation of the - and here I am with colleague Wieland - EU service ID card are unavoidable because they serve to prevent abuse such as illegal immigration and apparent contracts.Why do I think the guideline is so necessary?Three reasons: because of the economic importance of the third -country workers in the EU, because of the competitiveness of the companies and because of the smooth functioning of the internal market.On the one hand, I therefore welcome the strict frame and on the other hand, that the appropriate controls carried out by the Member States are as effective and simple as possible.My question at the end, because I am repeatedly asked about it, goes to the Commission: Will the directive be prejudiced to the accession negotiations?How is Article 1 interpreted and interpreted from your point of view because this plays an important role for our country at the border on the border and in the accession negotiations?President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!So far, business people had to find that two important freedoms, namely freedom of movement and free service transactions, did not apply to them.They actually had to endure endless bureaucratic immigration procedures by Member States in which a service was to be provided.Around 13 million third -country nationals live in Europe.The number of business people among them is not well known, but it should certainly not be low.	de
"I take as proof an excellent report that our colleague Mario Soares established in international bodies on the state of the seas and the oceans.Rightly, when we talked about climate change, we refer to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.But we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will considerably destabilize the entire parts of our land.It is therefore advisable that Europe, both because it must promote a certain model of development, and because it is itself confronted with serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, whether it is its groundwater, its surface waters or its seas, must be, in a way, exemplary in its practice.Besides, our Europe has signed international conventions.I am thinking in particular of the OSPAR Convention where it has made commitments.She said: ""In a few years we will have to have stopped spills with pollution, we will have to have ceased to increase pollution and even we will have to get closer to an almost zero level, with regard to toxic substances or dangerous substances"".Europe therefore affixes its signature to international agreements, and then the directive arrives, as well as concrete policies on the ground, and there it announces that it will not be able to achieve the objectives set or it differs them on dates such as the very credibility of the signing of these international conventions is laid.This is why, engaging in the debate relating to the framework directive on water, from the first reading, the European Parliament had set out to request a coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, and in particular, concerning the respect of OSPAR, a convergence which is effective, concrete and which engages us in action.The European Union water policy does not start from anything.Many guidelines have been adopted, and it is also the will of the Commission to make them more readable, more compatible with each other, with clearer objectives.It is therefore a concern for rationality that led to the realization of this framework directive.But our Parliament, at first reading, insisted that the current directive, not only was compatible with the commitments we made, - OSPAR type - but allows us to reverse the course of things.Because despite these numerous directives, despite frequent statements on the effort that must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe, we note that the objectives have not been achieved.In many cases the situation has deteriorated and therefore, we cannot be satisfied with an effort to rationalize the texts.We must set objectives that meet the challenges that are before us and we do not have much time, because if we do, as the commission had proposed, with too long deadlines, while it and the advice have further lengthened the deadlines, we will not only have a problem of credibility with opinion, but we know it well, the efforts will be put back tomorrow, and tomorrow they will not know thattarget objectives.I insist on this point, because it would not be necessary to wait for the umpteenth time, that disasters are reported every day in our newspapers to say: ""Ah! Europe did not do, ah! Europe should have"", and then, in the precipitation, to do as if we were going to solve the problems that we did not want to take the body in use in use."	fr
"We are, in principle, opposed to this type of programs as well as to structural funds, but since the vote concerns only the way in which these resources will be used - and not their volume - we voted for the report.We believe, in fact, that it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups mentioned in the report.We have not voted against this report insofar as he announces some fair general principles: for example, the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce gender inequalities on the labor market.But we did not vote for either because all of this remains most vague, if not in terms of vux piles.On the other hand, in terms of assistance and training projects for refugees, the report marks a decline compared to the initial text, since it wishes to specify that refugees are no longer concerned as such, but ""only refugees in the sense of the Geneva Convention"".This restriction is unacceptable while, throughout Europe, many refugees are in a dramatic situation, without protection, forced to work in illegality and to hide, while the governments and police of states that are said to be democratic hunt them.The first measure which is essential in this field is to give these undocumented legal means to lead a decent existence and to be able to work without being relegated to a status of parias, victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple administrative and police bully, the main one of which is to have to live permanently in the fear of expulsion..(En) I voted in favor of Ms. Stenzel's report on the Equal initiative because I think it is essential to continue the work that was started with the previous components Now, Horizon, Youthstart and Integra of Adapt and Employment Initiatives.We have to base ourselves on the lessons we have drawn from these actions.Equal means ""equality"".He must produce results.I am delighted with the concentration proposed on the promotion of new means of combating discrimination and any other form of inequality within the job market.I also support the desire to leave a outdated format and bring together partners in the search for innovative means to stem unemployment.Flexibility is needed.I strongly regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.During the last programming period, 9 % of the structural funds were allocated to community initiatives.This figure is now 5.3 %.This means that funds must be used in order to obtain a maximum effect and information on partnerships must be widely and quickly disseminated.The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has adopted several of the amendments that I had presented concerning, for example, the emphasis on access to priming capital, the way of exploiting new commercial opportunities in cities and rural areas, and criticism that companies were insufficient during previous initiatives.This has often had the consequence that good projects have not led to real opportunities in terms of employment.The positive experience of innovative actions on the part of small promoters was weakened by the distance between them from the decision -making process."	fr
"Many of us do not support the abolition of the death penalty in principle. In addition, we are suspicious of suggestions for imposing further behavior codes on businesses. While we appreciate the role of the European Union in supporting human rights, we believe that the regulatory framework and human rights legislation, as well as so many other areas related to the relationship between citizen and state, is a matter of national governments, so we do not applaud the expansion of the EU intervention. For these reasons, the British conservatives voted against the Malmstrfm resolution. Haarder Report (A5-0050/2000) (PPE-DE).(FR) Mr President, I would like to have voted in favor of the Haarder report, rather than some excerpts and interventions, including those in plenary, which shows that there are no rights to the family and that granting special rights to the family would be an action that would constitute a discreet, discreet, discreet, discriminatory, and discreet. The advocates of this theory should agree which line they want to follow. If there are no rights in itself for the family - as the Committee on Women's Rights decided, despite my will - then there are no rights for other heterosexual or homosexual communities and the capital ""lifestyles and various forms of relationships"" has no place in this report. As for me, I was very fortunate to grow up in a family all normal, with a mother and a father who had not divorced, and I continue to believe that this model of happy and united family is one of the bases of our society;Exhibition, especially after the approval of paragraph 18. Mr. President, I am a colleague with my colleague Lulling. I would like to point out that colleague Haarder made exemplary efforts to reach consensus. As a result, its report became much better than the corresponding previous reports. Following a large portion of my team, however, I voted for this report, however, because of the points 52-56 are adopted by controversial socio-political demands, which the Left supports in the body, but have nothing to do with human rights. The German Constitution puts marriage and family under its particular protection and this has nothing to do with human rights violations. It is contrary to their guarantee. Marriage and family are the foundation of human rights such as the right to life. In this respect I believe that these points should be received in the human rights report. The report would then receive unanimous approval of the body, because otherwise the work of colleague Haarder was exemplary. Mr President, I would like, in addition to my colleague Pirker, to point out that I have agreed with point 42 of the Haarder report, although it contains a mistake, as Austria is referring to free circulation."	el
"The consequences of this policy are already reflected in the strengthening of extreme racist and fascist forces outside Austria. However, the report on the fight against racism does not indicate that the necessary conclusions are made. We thus condemn the EU company as a human rights as an excuse for strengthening its anti-folk and democratic nature and new interventions against peoples. We urge peoples to be awake and not allow people who call people who call people who call themselves to the country, but to create solutions that guarantee the development and flourishing of these rights. For all these reasons, the three MEPs of the Greek Communist Party are refrain from voting..(FR) I would like to compare the reports of Ludford and Harder and Duff and Voggenhuber. The European Parliament proposes participation in the preparation of the European Charter of Fundamental Rights. Why not? However, it is difficult to understand how this extra text promotes the battle for human rights, unless it brings a little more legal ambiguity. What in particular to think about the image that our parliament has on the rights mentioned? After reading Ludford and Haarder's reports, we have come to the first outline: an anarchist society project based on rights without obligations, without responsibility. Freedom cannot be prescribed. However, it seems that the construction of a community is not aware of this reality: in the construction of a community, they not only want to make people happy, without just taking into account their differences and wishes, but also to create a society without a pace without making a difference in what can or cannot be made, a society that supports hedonism or the culture of death. A human person cannot understand himself as an independent entity of people surrounding him who only takes care of his or her immediate well -being. It is true that he has rights that, paradoxically, most often denied the right, the right to life that must be defended and promoted;But you seem to have forgotten that a human being needs to determine the objective boundaries of all social life. Not only does a human being needs to be given ways to live, but also, and above all, the reasons to live. An extraordinary book, even if it is European, will undoubtedly not respond to this need..(NL) We have accepted the Harder report, but we want to make the following notes in the draft report 19 and 20. Paragraph 19 of the draft report asks Belgia to sign a European Convention on the Protection of National Minorities. It is not true that Flanderi prevents Belgia from ratifying this agreement on the protection of national minorities, but it must be made on the condition that the Charter is not suitable for the constitutional concept of the Belgian. In the Belgian federal state, the states are equal on the basis of the warranty of the Constitution. Neither really forms a minority. As the national minority is not clearly defined in the agreement, Flanderi does not consider that it can be applied to the border area: for Flander, the term ""national minority"" may only mean a minority who has residents in a particular area in such a context, while French-speaking people in the border have only moved there about 30 years agoVallonia and their fully integrated offspring). In addition, French-speaking people living in the border area, with their language services, enjoy protection that the actual minorities can often only dream of. That is, the one who, through this agreement, is trying to change the situation in the border region of the Brussels environment, indirectly causes the constitutional balance of the Belgian and once again illustrates that European ignorance of our federal system renders us to conclude that separate Member States Flanderi and Vallonia are a better option than Belgium. Belgian French -speaking members of the European Parliament will once again take advantage of this vote in internal Belgian political games. We do not want to participate in them and make a clear difference."	fi
EC actors are very quickly prepared to work on the Mexican market equally with other countries, especially the United States. As in all negotiations, compromises in these negotiations had to be found in certain areas, but the results are a balanced package that ensures access to the market while taking into account special issues. Last but not the least, I would like to express the Commission to appreciate the short time, the one month in which Parliament gives his opinion. It is very important because it will pave the way to the EC-Mexico Joint Council meeting in connection with the Lisbon European Council next week. This enables the rapid entry into force of these results, which is in the interests of both of us and Mexico, as you know. Much thanks, Commission member Liikanen. The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered at 12 noon. The information society for everyone on the agenda is the following by Read's Industrial, Foreign Trade, Research and Energy Committee Report (A5-0067/2000) Eeurope-Information Society for all-Commission initiative for an additional European Council in Lisbon 23 and March 24, 2000 (1999) 687-C5-0063/2000-2000/2034 (Cos))..(EN) Mr President, May I start by thanking the Commission for the well -reasoned, well -founded and well -assessed document. Of course, it has been scheduled to be simultaneously with the Lisbon next week's meeting, and Parliament has had to work very quickly, for which I thank many colleagues who have helped here, and of course the secretariat. When I was a small child, I was opened in the village where I was born and grew, the library. When the headmaster opened the library, he said that there were more than 4,000 books in the library and I thought as wisely as a 6-year-old child, that there were all the books in the world. Now I own more than 4,000 books myself, and although this is not as such a revolution in knowledge, it is some kind of reference, transferred from personal to political level, the speed of change in information, distribution, application and refining. However, we have to put this in some kind of perspective and remind ourselves that most people in the world have never played on the phone and probably never plays. The Commission's proposals and the Parliament's reply clearly recognize that the market may be and should be an engine for much of this change, but not in every case. The challenge is to solve because the European Union should allow the market to perform driving and because it should be addressed and regulated - when we should deal with, in accordance with the interests and for how long. We must remember - and this is also emphasized in the Commission's proposal and in the Parliament's reply - that third -generation mobile phones, which our future depends largely, are an area where the European Union is in an important lead, and this leadership is partly explained by the intervention. Approval of the GSM standard has meant that the European Union has a strong advantage. Our report mentions issues related to social security and the impact of this change in society, and I am grateful to the Employment and Social Committee, and especially to the member Cercas, the Committee's statement to the draftsman, - the only committee that has completed his statement in such a short time - for his great job. If I can explain the procedures and very briefly, the Social Affairs Committee voted on Monday afternoon at the same time as the Committee on Industrial, Foreign Trade, Research and Energy, and with the consent of the preparatory, I have taken some of his suggestions and presented them in the name of my political group. I hope they have support because they have a lot of important details. Other reviews look at matters relating to the rights of people with disabilities. I have negotiated with many different parties to ensure that certain basic principles of certain users of disabled users and people in the workplace are included in this report, and to hope for the upcoming 1999 legislation at an early stage.	fi
With the determination of a sector reserved for the public postal operators based on weight and price limits, the mail directive enabled a gradual and controlled liberalization.The sudden reduction in these limit values ​​questions the balance between the common good obligation and the economic viability of the postal services.In view of a globalization process, in which profit and profit thinking is more and more opposed to the effort for regional balance and the goal of social cohesion, it is reaffirmed at this point that we are taking on the service in the European Union subject to the common good, whether it is now about the railway or the day after tomorrow.President!Like other Scottish members of this high house, i.e. representatives of Scotland, I also raise my voice to protest against everything that leads to a decline of quality rural life in remote areas.The postal service and the post office are a characteristic of life in rural communities all over Europe and not least in Scotland.It would be a disaster if they were taken intentionally or even unintentionally measures that would be destroyed.I don't think anyone wants that.I don't think the Commission wants to explain the war to the Scottish or Greek islands.But I think she could accidentally do great damage.It is about determining the speed and which methods the gradual liberalization of postal services should take.If the goals are set too low for the continued existence of the postal service monopoly, it would be uneconomical to maintain the universality of the service in remote areas at an affordable price.The balance between universality and affordability is crucial.The very clear message, which is now going to the Commission from all sides of the house, is that the commission should act carefully.For example, the commission should not suddenly do a jump of 350 grams, as some MPs suggested, only do 50 grams.On the contrary, it should be careful.I can imagine that everything under 150 grams would be extremely unclear under these circumstances.The solidarity and cohesion of people across Europe depends on the idea that you can send a letter anywhere and that this letter is delivered everywhere to an affordable stamp fee.Stay with universality and affordability!President!In order to guarantee a high -quality postal universal service, it must definitely be preserved as a public service.The universal service, which includes an offer of high -quality postal services at affordable prices that are provided at every place in the area, forms the basis of the way of working in the entire postal system and must lead to a unit tariff throughout the national territory.But he must be preserved as a public service.This is the only way to guarantee that the network is all -encompassing from collecting to delivery, which is not fragmented or only partially and as used as the postal service operator fits.However, as is well known, the Commission has commissioned studies to be informed of the Community of the Community of the Community of the Community of the Community, of which it did not inform the European Parliament, and that's why there is no know about the consequences of their application, be it in the service for the citizens, be it for today's European postal operators, whether under economic aspects or in terms of employment.	de
"With deep sadness we reject a resolution that destroys its positive points with the divergences we have denounced and, anxious, we are addressing a warning: ""This road you took will destroy the European Union and remove it from the common sense of overwhelming majority."", in writing.(FR) I would like to explain the reasons why I voted against the annual report on respect for human rights in the European Union. Two of the provisions of this text call on some countries, including France, to ratify the European Convention on the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. First of all I have to dismantle the misunderstanding that staining any discussion about regional languages: there is no question in any way to ban anyone from talking, teaching or promoting a minority or regional language, whatever it is. Since their learning and use remain a personal choice, I, personally, am in favor of any measure that favors the preservation and dissemination of these languages, which are part of the cultural heritage of nations. Distribution against this report because, through the call for ratification of the European Convention on the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter on Regional and Minority Languages ​​I mentioned earlier, the Haarder report aims to promote a perception of the European construction based on a ""visual building"". According to this perception, the individual has individual rights because he belongs to a territorial, ethnic or religious entity, and the community is the inevitable mediator between the individual and the right he claims. However, although community recognition may appear, at first glance, as a protective factor for the integration of minorities, it is, in fact, a powerful factor in division and backwarding society (consider the situation of girls from Turkey or the Magreb countries.marginalized in a primitive regime for women). Similarly, although recognizing a particular regime in communities gives the impression that it protects the most weak and disadvantaged, on the contrary, it is a division of society from which liberalism, the winner, derives benefits. Moreover, although it is true that the expansion of the European Union requires us to take into account the particular fate of certain national minorities, however, the solution of communities is not a future perspective for the populations threatened or oppressed. On the contrary, recent history has shown how much people's sense of people belong to a community can be a catalyst for the awakening of ethnic ethics dating back to millennia and bringing conflicts with them. Instead of this perception, I prefer the holistic view of a democratic Europe in which every individual as a person is a fully active subject of his rights and freedoms. I prefer a Europe that gives opportunities to integrate to all those who subscribe to its common values, whether they claim their participation in a religious community or have no religion, speak the language of their ancestors or have chosen to overcome their roots."	el
I believe it is a clear gesture and a first step to solving this problem. However, I would like to ask Parliament's presidency to consider that it would be advisable to invite all Members to do the same. Mr President, let me first say that I fully support the assistants regime. Yesterday, when I arrived in Parliament, I was given a document on the proposed gathering of the assistants outside the doors of parliament. As all colleagues will know - and many of you have approached me during the last six months - all reports and events are first examined by the Committee of Parliament. To give a painless example, it is not possible to carry out commercial reports in parliament for obvious reasons. After a letter I received yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would suggest that they be allowed to hold a meeting or concentration, probably in the near future and possibly next month. However, all reports must be made to prevent the smooth operation of the parliament. Yesterday afternoon during the Bureau meeting I signed a letter informing the assistants. However, I also learned that they had been informed orally about this decision by the Committee of the Presidents of the Political Groups last Thursday, therefore, they were fully aware of the decision. There is no objection to expressing our views, there is no objection to meeting possibly during the next period of Parliament. But there was some misunderstanding because they received a letter from someone else who thought he was given the permission. However, all reports are first examined by the so -called Comart Committee. As you can see, there are many events around Parliament, either for various countries or other character. In this case, this is not an attempt to prohibit or oppose the very real and justified principle that we must have a status for assistants. Thank you, Mrs. Banotti. I believe that your intervention has clarified various issues raised. We are now moving on to votes. Voting Madam President, I take the floor on behalf of the Spanish delegation of the European People's Party, the delegation of the Spanish People's Party, regarding Mrs Terrsn I Cusi's resolution on the area of ​​freedom, security and justice. Indeed, in some votes we did not follow the guidelines of the European People's Party team and voted in favor of the Terron I Cusn resolution, which we consider as a whole. We have voted down, in fact, paragraphs 2 and 6, because in our view they are not legally correct. On the contrary, we voted in favor of causal thought I, which actually agrees with what I myself as an opinionist of the opinion I proposed to the Committee on Freedoms and Rights of the Citizens for the Intergovernmental Conference. We have also voted in favor of paragraph 13. An appropriate regime and the right to movement and establishment for third -country nationals is something that the Spanish People's Party has long advocated. For similar reasons, we voted in favor of paragraph 14, where the oral amendment has lifted specific and absolutely justified concerns about a supplementary problem, to the extent that political rights, no longer voting in the municipal elections, but political rights in general, are part of the sovereignty.	el
"Due to the beginning of the votes, we are now interrupting a joint debate, which will continue at 3pm. Votes.(FR) Mr President, I just would like to express clearly and precisely the following issues of the reviews we discuss: there are 29 reviews and one proposal for a joint statement. It is self -evident that I am a rapporteur in favor of reviews of the Committee on Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Policy. In addition, I would like to say that I also support all the checks that are designed to restore the position adopted by the European Parliament's first process. But I want to make it clear that I can't and say this as a presenter in favor of checks that are too far from the first handling of the position. This applies in particular to checks 17, 16 and 19. After the vote: Mr President, can the Commission confirm that it has approved the revision 1 of the Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Policy Committee? This would mean that the Directive could be approved by a qualified majority, and then we could leave it alone. Then the Belgian and the French could enjoy British chocolate as much as the British have enjoyed French and Belgian chocolate.(The President declared a common position as approved in this way.) The recommendation of the Committee on Environmental Health, the Public Health and Consumer Policy (A5-0054/2000) from the joint position of the Council to adopt a European Parliament and Council decree on a revised community-based system of the Community (10656/2/1999 C5-0223/1996/032)(Rapporteur: Schnellhardt) (The President declared a common position as approved by this.1998/0289 (COD)) (Rapporteur: Blokland) (President declared a common position as approved by Davies, Davies' Report on Environmental Affairs, Public and Consumer Policy (A5-0062/2000) by proposal for the European Parliament and the Council as a Directive of Otsone (Kom (1999) 125 --001999/0068 (COD)) (Parliament approved the legislative decision statement.) The report of the Environmental Affairs, Public Health and Consumer Policy Committee (A5-0063/2000) by the European Parliament and the Council as a Directive for National Emission Limits (Kom (19999) 125 C5-00471999/0067 (COD)). Mr President, I would like to point out a translation error concerning the checks 18 and 30. Yeah, Member Myller, I just found out that these mistakes are already known to language services. We can really bring them up soon. Prior to 18 votes in both reviews, 18 and 30, should read ""Critical loads are not exceeded"". The word over the word is said to be achieved, which makes it the opposite. Well, it certainly became clear to everyone.(Parliament approved the legislative decision statement.) A joint proposal for resolution of an extraordinary meeting of the European Council in Lisbon on 23 and 24 March 2000 (Parliament accepted the resolution. It would take three or four minutes. I would be very grateful if we could do it now. In my opinion, we should not sacrifice any more time on this subject. I'll give the matter to Parliament to decide. Mr President, I would ask you to take into account that French socialists in the hall do not participate in the vote. In their opinion, the resolution presented to us is not fair. Namely, they hope that the Environmental Directives will be included in EU policies and that they will be applied as part of these policies, but it must be affected by all Directives and not just the Natura 2000 Directive and Migration Birds Directive. They also believe that the application of directives is the right of the Commission and the Court and are within their competence."	fi
"If we continue to bother in the proposals that have so far given mediocre results, I do not see how we will advance, or what the Commission can do.The same remark applies to the enlargement which represents its own end without a much more effective reform of the European Union and its structures, and proposals that the Commission could also have made during the CIG.Mr. President, I would like to end with a positive note, perhaps contrary to the advice of certain colleagues, with regard to the telegram you have sent to the Austrian government.Your position has convinced us, you were right not to isolate this country even more.However, we will see in practice what will be the concrete gestures.I repeat, Mr. President, it is a vision in our opinion a little myopic.He especially lacks an impulse in the sectors I have cited, for example the Balkans.Can we continue to exclude the Balkans from enlargement, without thinking that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to be part of our Europe?Madam President, Mr. Prodi, I applaud your proposal to make a radical decentralization of Union activities, but I ask you: Why do you then present a collection of centralizing laws?I remember the speech held five years ago by your predecessor.Mr. Santer had made the same promises as you - ""less and better"" but what we had in the end was ""much more and much worse"".I don't think you are able to keep your commitments.You talk about decentralization, but you act in centralizing.This collection of laws is only a monotonous list of questions about which citizens will lose all influence;It is yourself, Mr. Prodi, who remove this influence from citizens, even for social issues.You talk about increasing transparency, but you present proposals to hide documents that are today accessible.Your committee is made up of 20 people who are the only ones, within the EU, to be able to propose a reduction in the legislative volume.No local politician has this power from the moment a law was adopted in Brussels.This is why the collection of laws published by the Commission should at least be accompanied by an equally large collection of skills which are returned to the Member States and to the democratic power of citizens, failing which the volume of the legislation adopted in Brussels will not cease to grow.We have adopted 10,000 laws and as many legislative changes;The candidate countries have received 26,000 documents, which represent, for the Polish parliament, for example, 140,000 pages to examine.Already today, this figure is a lot, much too high.Brussels must make fewer decisions and grant more powers in this area to citizens, regions and member states;Only decisions concerning cross -border problems about which national parliaments can no longer legislate effectively must be the responsibility of Brussels."	fr
"On the other hand, it obliges the ships to deliver all the waste to ports, unless they have sufficient storage capacity to allow them to reach their next destination in the next port. In addition, it obliges the ships to announce the delivery of waste they are going to make before they sail to the port, and to pay the costs for the reception facilities. That's where the problem lies. As various speakers have already pointed out, there are radically diverging the positions of Parliament and the Commission. I would like to ask you, ladies and gentlemen, in this regard, even taking into account that the Commission is going to support the amendment no.16 by Mr. Sterckx - I will refer to the other amendments then - to accept the original proposal. It is true that we do not specify precisely what percentage to be taken by all the ships that coach in a port. It is true that we leave a margin of flexibility in the states, but it is also a fact that, theoretically, 0.01%, although it is a contribution, is not necessarily a substantial contribution. We could perhaps incorporate the word ""noun"" into the text, instead of specifying a certain percentage. I would suggest a solution of this type, incorporating amendment no.16 of Mr. Sterckx, which helps to have a revision that may allow us to determine a stable rate if we find that states do not go ahead when the time comes to make this distribution and that this excessive flexibility makes the directive empty. I would, however, attempt to take a step in a first phase, making this position flexible with the possibility of reviewing it. In addition, I would like to point out that we consider very positive the proposals made and that in this sense we could integrate them into the text of the Directive with some final corrective interventions on syntax, in a way that ensures compatibility with applicable international and community,13, 14 and 15. That is, we are essentially talking about all the amendments and really the one we cannot accept - and I am sorry, but I have already explained the reasons that dictate it to us - is the amendment no.6. I could expand, but the two reasons were already exposed. The goal we all seek is the same. The only thing we differentiate is in the way we will do it better. I would ask for support in a position that would give us more opportunities, supplemented - I insist - with amendment no.16 by Mr. Sterckx, who would provide us with the necessary guarantees. In this sense, I would suggest, instead of ""in percentage"", to possibly incorporate the word ""noun"", which obviously means that we are not talking about 1%, or 5%or 10%, but about an important number. Thank you very much, Mr President. I want to re -re -re -thanks to the rapporteur and to the rest of the committee."	el
"I do not expect waving or giving away all of this with which they will be confronted in the next few years.I rather count that the European Parliament is not only a critical observer, as it was in this case, but also actively participates in the fact that the Union in the fight against crime.Voting Mr. Goebbels, I apologize, I have the impression that there is a bit of a change, since there was an oral change to change, in which it was suggested that the words ""with a high credit check on the basis of a recognized creditworthiness scale"" and they had wished for such a change.Mrs. President!I apologize, I first had a change of change 36 in the eye, which logically comes before the application for change 37.We are now talking about amendment 37, and here we have a similar problem.A high credit check is not required for the facilities, but for the instruments.So the text reads: ""Instruments with a high rating base on a recogified scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation"".I ask you to excuse this error again.Are there any objections to this oral amendment?(The parliament agrees to the oral application application.) (In successive votes, the parliament accepts the two designs of the legislative resolution.) Mrs. President!I asked for the word right before the start of the session to say something solely for you as President of this plenary, a plenary of everyone present here.For the second time in two weeks, visits to this parliament, which served to charges conditions - what I respect and with which I completely agree, since I am for the freedom of expression of all - attacks against people, parties, such as those I represent and institutions.I keep such a procedure, especially if you are present, Ms. President, to be dishonest, and I decide to decide it, all the more than we are about to make an election campaign.Therefore, especially because of the respect you deserve, I cannot accept such procedures and emphatically reject them.That was a personal remark, as I am told.We will note this in the protocol.Mrs. President!Above all out of respect for you, a respect that I think is worthy of, and out of respect for this plenary, I did not explicitly go into the specific topic that I spoke about, but now I do it as a member of this parliament, as a general secretary of a party of the Basque Country and as a normal citizen of this country, due to the particularly difficult allegations against people and parties like that, with a long democratic tradition and withConscientious respect and defense of human rights for many years.Mrs. President!I would like to express my concern that this louder defense of human rights, which was just presented by Mr. Gorka Knörr, apparently does not prevent his government from counting on the parliamentary cooperation of a faction that not only does not condemn violence against citizens and real assets, but also supports them and encourages them to do so.As I see, Mr. Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso on the same topic is asking for the word.We will not open any pronunciation now."	de
"Mr President, dear colleagues, we are not discussing for the first time about the media in Serbia. We've been talking about it for years. Let us remember that in October 1998, after NATO abandoned its first plan of attack on Serbia to help the Kosovars, because Milosevic had receded by allowing OSCE observers to enter the country, it was exactly the case at that time. Problems, and now the results. In the last two years we have found that the media has been more and more displaced. But this was already here. Seeing the way the media is facing, one wonders how weak the Milosevic system should really feel. Obviously, he is a great fear that the majority of citizens could finally be revealed to the majority of citizens the terrible truth about his long -standing behavior towards all Serbian citizens, and especially to the Serbs. He is afraid that the people could therefore soon face Milosevic and his accomplices as the Romanians treated Ceausescu. I believe that he is very scared this and we should help the media so that they can disclose the truth about Milosevic and his regime. Mr President, as it seems, the Milosevic regime is not tired of fighting. It has recently taken systematic action against local stations. In this context, it does not hesitate to use violence. At the same time, do the high -profile mass media not hesitate to undertake an immediate defamatory campaign against the country's independent media outlets called ""NATO agents""?or ""traitors of the homeland""?. There are reasons that the powerful Serbian police have taken special action today, and especially in cities where the opposition won the municipal elections in November 1996. In view of the forthcoming municipal and parliamentary elections, many people in Serbia assume that the Milosevic regime has already begun its campaign. In terms of Milosevic, regional radio and television stations are an obvious goal. Anyone who wants to hear something other than those that the state media is retired from Belgrade has as their only refuge. By the way, it is almost impossible to find in the province of the few independent newspapers in circulation. This once again emphasizes the importance of the political opposition in the Serbian ether! As expected, the Serbian monocator contradicts the non -directed mass media in a sneaky way. Various duties on lack of leave or delayed payments to the state cover the real political objective that is to silence the population. On the other hand, the politically correct radio stations of the children of Milocevic Marko and Marija were deemed appropriate. Given this sad situation, I believe that everyone trying in Serbia to defend freedom of the press deserve our help. And not only in words but, as defined in the common resolution submitted in paragraph 3, our specific assistance with the provision of, after consultations, new equipment at the hit stations."	el
I would therefore like to reiterate my congratulations to the Langen rapporteur for the work accomplished, to thank all the speakers and, of course, to greet the action of the Provan vice-president during the conciliation procedure, which has effectively contributed to obtaining a positive result.I also salute the reasonable and flexible action of the council.Save The agenda calls for the report (A5-0010/2000) of Ms. Ahern, on behalf of the delegation of the Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the Common Decision Project, approved by the Conciliation Committee, the European Parliament and the Council arresting a multi -year program for the encouragement of energy efficiency -Save (C5-0334/1999 -1997/0371 (COD)).Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for this useful and in -depth conciliation procedure which has completely gone in a good climate, which is not always the case.I am delighted to say that I can consider the final result of this conciliation as satisfactory for the Parliament since the common project has integrated all its amendments, whether it is entirely or after reformulation.The sum finally allocated to the program also constitutes a considerable improvement in the council proposal at second reading, a proposal that we had estimated completely unacceptable and we have made great progress in this regard.I therefore propose that this assembly accepts to adopt the proposals relating to Save and the conclusions drawn during the third reading conciliation.I would like to remind the Assembly that Parliament adopted, at the second reading, this report which contains 8 amendments, including a restoration of the original budget of the Commission.The Commission accepted 5 of the proposed amendments, including the budgetary allowance, and I thank the Commission for its constant support for the budget during the conciliation procedure, since the council proposal was unacceptable.During the procedure, we reached an agreement on studies and actions to be carried out to design, implement, supplement and assess community measures.Compromise formulations have been agreed for 5 other amendments, including legislative and non -legislative measures, and the inclusion of local energy centers, and, very important, audit systems in terms of energy in examining the progress made in terms of energy efficiency.I hope you all agree that this is significant progress.Parliament firmly defended the question of the financial envelope in the face of the very thin opening offer made by the Council.Finally, we had to come together several times before the council increased the sum and made a substantial offer.We have obtained an increase of 2 million compared to the sum proposed at the start, which constituted a decisive increase that I recommend to you and which will be able to allow, the Commission confirmed, the implementation of the program.This was important to us.However, I want to say that this budget is and has always been modest and that, therefore, the financing of this program is more symbolic than real.It is mainly Member States that finance energy savings.We have to keep this in mind when we will approve this program.It would be regrettable that our community achievements be more symbolism than reality because enthusiasm exists, at the local level, in favor of actions, including community actions, intended to promote energy savings.	fr
I am satisfied with the rapporteur's approach to state aid and I congratulate it.There is too often tendency to castigate state aid as measures distorting competition.Certainly an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market and the economic and monetary union.However, as the rapporteur points out, such aid is sometimes essential and can allow, beyond the survival of such or such a company, to contribute to sustainable development (article 6 of the treaty), services of general interest (article 16) and economic and social cohesion (article 158).However, it is obvious that they must be controlled, a mission that returns to the European Commission.Aid devoted each year by the Union's member states to the sectors considered reached a total of 95 billion euros during the period 1995-1997, 40 % of which are for the manufacturing sector.These aids decreased considerably compared to the previous period, 1993-1995 (drop by 13 % in the total amount and 3.8 % to 2.6 % of the amount of aid in the manufacturing sector).This decline in aid is mainly explained by the decrease in aid granted to the new German Länder.I deplore, like the rapporteur, that the figures presented in the report do not cover all state aid.The European Commission must compensate for these deficiencies as quickly as possible.It must also cooperate with the Member States to improve the quality of the data in good time, that is to say, for the ninth report.It would be good for the Commission to publish a register which makes the amount of state aid by Member State.I also regret that the European Parliament is completely excluded from the advisory committee on state aid.To compensate for this situation, the European Commission must make, to make us, regular reports.I will finish on one aspect of the use of state aid which seems particularly dangerous to me: these are aid that leads to the relocation of companies from one Member State to another, with the risk of a grant hunt that brings nothing to the common objectives of the EU.This is why I hope that the next report on state aid includes an assessment of the effect of these employment aids, as well as on the industry and craft sectors in beneficiary countries.Langen report (A5-0073/1999) In the important debate on competition, I expressed myself this morning on the text of Mr. Langen, relating to the application in 1998 of the 6th code of aid to the steel industry.As the Court of Justice recognized it in its order of May 3, 1996, the steel sector is particularly sensitive to competitive disturbances.This is why it was legitimate to establish an aid regime in this sector aimed at guaranteeing the survival of efficient companies, although article 4, point C, of ​​the CECA treaty for all state aid to the steel industry.This is, in fact, the object of the 6th code of aid to the steel industry.	fr
I would like to express my gratitude to the Commission for the efforts she made in this area and for cooperating with her excellent employees. Finally, I would like to express my gratitude to the plenary as well because it was a friendly mood to hear these things at this advanced time. Mr President, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur, Mr. CederschiFLD for the very serious work he did. Clearly identified the problems created by the approval of the conditions of the world's intellectual property. Their approval is a questionable historical fact that the European Union for the first time participates as a Contracting Party in an international treaty governing the field of intellectual property. It is a fact that the road was long, mainly because of the legal problem that arose on whether the community could be fully responsible for intellectual property issues. The problem has been overcome. Today we are called upon to give our assent to the essence of two conditions: the Treaty on intellectual property and the treaty on interpretations and executions and phonographs. As for the former, it seems to resolve in a way effectively fixed to the creators of artistic and literary works, while creating the framework for protection in distribution, leasing, presentation of their works to the public. Regarding the second treaty on executions and phonographs, it should be emphasized that, for the first time, they are recognized by an international treaty, signed by the Community, exclusive rights to performers, interpreters, artists, reproduction, distribution, leasing to the public, as well as a right to fair. In this context, it is noteworthy the important step of progress the treaty is taking on the issue of reproduction. Although, as the Commission states, there are no specific provisions in the texts of the circumstances that regulate all the individual issues that arise with technological evolution, one may argue that within this legislative framework created, performers or interpreters are enjoying broader protection from the existing direction. The interpretation of Article 7 of the Treaty leads us to the conclusion that the implementation of reproduction protection does not only mean protecting the reproduction of the interpretations or executions themselves that are integrated into phonographs, but also to the protection of copying, partial or total, permanent or ephemeral, as well as protection. But it is also advisable to refer to some places that should be the focus of the future work of the foot or other diplomatic conferences. First, this is the right to distribute as stated in Article 8, paragraph 1. The possibility given to the states by the next paragraph of the same article to regulate the issue of the consumption of the above right is dangerous and is one of the most negative points in the treaty, since nothing prevents states from establishing their rights.	el
"I would only like to deal with some of the specific observations made during the discussion. First of all, with regard to the observations of Mr Graefe Zu Baringdorf, I would like to assure him that we will amend the process of approval of GMO additives in the Directive No.70/524 and not in the Directive on new feed. It is a directive that deals more specifically with raw raw materials than with additional materials. The text of Parliament is by the Directive approved in 1998. However, the vertical legislation in Directive 90/220 on how to assess the environmental risk by the GMOs has been amended since then and is still changing. Examined by parliament at a second reading. I believe we must expect the final results of Directive 90/220, and in particular Article 11. The question was also raised whether this proposal could increase the risk of monopolies. Mr Kindermann and Mrs Auroi referred to it. I would like to make just a few observations on this subject. First of all, this issue has been processed since 1993, so it is not really a surprise to any other raw material producer. Indeed, anyone who applies to such products can still do so for their particular product. I would also like to note that the Commission has never approved an application for approval to include GMOs in additional materials. Mrs Roth-Behrendt referred to the issue of the appropriate legal basis, whether it is Article 37 or Article 152. I will again refer to what I said earlier on the subject and assure it, as I will assure the body, that it would be completely inappropriate for the committee to try to try to justify it,the provision of any reference to public health. It is a matter examined in at least two separate cases by the Court of Justice of the European Communities, which set the legal criteria for situations such as the present, where the appropriate legal basis must be taken duly in the promotion of legislation. The case law of the court seems quite clear about it. As a general comment on the amendments proposed here, in particular in relation to the issue of the legal basis, it would be inappropriate in my opinion to amend the legal basis in Article 152 under these circumstances, as it would be very likely to clash with the objective criteria set out by the Court. Some of you - Mr. Nicholson in particular - referred to the issue of marking. Directive 70/524 provides for the issue of marking on genetic modifications of additives. It has already been included now ""reporting of the particular features due to processing products"". Thus, this issue will be examined. This wording allowed us to oblige applicants to indicate that genetically modified techniques have been used in the product for which the application is submitted.- (de) Mr President, let me another question to the commissioner."	el
However, the point was withdrawn from the agenda of the budget commission last night without a debate or a vote took place.Therefore, it must be removed from today's agenda.It's logical, Mr. Wynn.The report is therefore removed from the agenda.Mr. President, I presume that the comments that Ms. Lynne made yesterday on health and security in this building concerned the pipes because he reigns on the fifth floor of the tower a pestilential odor.It is advisable to take care of this problem because it clearly indicates a serious failure.I do not constantly want to put the problems of this building on the carpet but that is a serious concern.Madame Ahern, we took note.I would ask you to submit this specific case, which concerns the fans of a precise floor, to the quaestors, who are in fact responsible for this type of problem.However, we will also share with our services.Thank you so much.(The minutes are adopted) Reform of European Competition Policy The agenda calls in common the following reports: A5-0069/1999 of Mr. Von Wogau, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the White Paper of the Commission on the modernization of rules for applying articles 85 and 86 of the CE Treaty (COM (1999) 101-C5-0105/1999-1999/2108 (COS));A5-0078/1999 by Mr. Rapkay, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the XXVIIIth Commission Report on Competition Policy (1998) (Sec (1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124 (COS) (COS);A5-0087/1999 by Mr. Jonckheer, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the seventh report on state aid in the manufactured products sector and certain other sectors of the European Union (COM (1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110 (COS));A5-0073/1999 by Mr. Langen, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the Commission report on the application in 1998 of its decision No 2496/96/CECA of December 18, 1996 establishing community rules for the steel aid (Code of Aids to the steel) (COM (1999) 094 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107 (COSS)).Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, today, we are carrying out an important debate on the competition policy of the European Union.We debate a very controversial modernization project of European law in terms of understanding, namely the Von Wogau report, a subject much more controversial than the vote within the Economic Commission seems to show.From the outset, I mean that, for my part, and in this concrete case, I believe that the commission's proposal is wrong and that we still have to determine whether the concept of modernization is really justified with regard to the content of the white paper on articles 81 and 82 or if, in this case, a step back would not rather be the appropriate concept.However, today we are discussing the report on state aid and the general report on competition policy for 1998, my contribution to this common discussion affecting the last report.	fr
However, in this case, I do not consider that there is room for soft laws and therefore the current asset management regulation is fully valid during the transition period until this law has been amended through the appropriate democratic process in this Parliament and the Council. The White Book includes absolute assurance and provisions for this. However, I would add it very important because it is a transition that the education, advice, support and confirmation will be taken care of, and the new supervisor of the audit unit will take office by May 1, and due to this and many other confirmations, I believe that we can be as confident as the system. I have to raise two more things, as this is an essential and central issue for reforms. The first one concerns that people consider to be quite understandable, that the transition is either a risk of liability or disability. The disappearance of responsibility is because some people consider that control and discipline are not sufficient. I completely reject this concept, and simply because I know the norms of the Commission officials, the responsibility of the CEOs of the Directors and the confirmation of our system. Inability could only be the result of anxiety, and we do everything we can provide to provide support and education to reduce the possibility of doing so. Finally, I would say that our current system is currently unsustainable, which the independent expert group strongly emphasized. Indeed, the Court has called it fictitious. In any case, the change must take place, and it requires a transition phase, as it is not possible to invent a system that allows us to move from one system to another overnight. For the time being, if it is possible on the basis of everything we have and our ability to design, I am confident that we have started or intend to start a system that guarantees the Union, taxpayers and Parliament full certainty on the basis of our proposals. Mr President, the appreciation of the reform process was certainly, perhaps a little prematurely, very large, which must be recognized. My question is: the reform is needed, in particular, due to the joining of new states and thus the expansion of the Union. How can we meet the Parliament of the Commission, Parliament and States applying for membership even more effectively, taking into account the thoughts and opinions of the applicant states? The delegations are also active in my own Czech Republic's delegation, but it must be said that our interaction often resembles a lot of relationship between the teacher and the student. How can the reform contribute to enhance the relationship and cooperation between the European Parliament, the National Parliament and the Commission? I am grateful to the Member of the Parliament for emphasizing the necessity of reforms due to joining, enlargements, and especially the expansions that our Union intends to take soon, not to mention the benefits of reforms as such. In the coming years, I will continue, of course, in collaboration with several of my colleagues in the Commission, the in -depth discussions we have already launched with the new Member States' administration. This is how we try to explain to the applicant states as comprehensively as possible what kind of system they are joining. I would also like to have the efforts of existing Member States and the generally launched of the Union in the field of education to become more diversified, which would ensure that the change would be as seamless as new officials commenced in the Commission and the administration of Member States and the administrative staff to adapt to the new reality, union membership and uniform markets. I would love to see that our management and actions would be at this level. Now I can only promise that we are trying hard. You can start by wishing the Commission member very good for St. David's Day. Thanks for your presentation. It is important that the Commission will never disappear from the fact that the reform process is merely a waste of time unless it has a connection with European citizens.	fi
"As for energy, the issue has been of particular importance lately, because I think that the voice of Europe should sound more and more in energy problems. In terms of transport, we will be zealous to create a single European airspace. This is a major issue related to the problematic of ecology. Finally, we have consumer rights and the health issue. Consumer rights are the safety of products and services. It takes a clearer legislation for citizens to protect them from traps such as misleading advertising. In 2000 the proposal for the European Food Authority will be specified. We have already acquired the White Bible and in the fall we will have the legislative text that will promote this new initiative. We must add other proposals, currently undergoing the protection of animal rights, a matter discussed strongly in recent months. This is in some ways our daily ""turnover"", the tradition of our products, for which we have committed to European citizens. These things really affect the lives of all of us directly, and that is why parliament has a completely decisive role. You perform the important role of the intermediary for European citizens and our duty is to work together to give citizens a clear, specific and immediate answer. The other day we closed the discussion by asserting that our success will be judged on the basis of citizens' participation in the next European elections. I personally believe that we are preparing confidence and relationship with citizens with the specific measures I have mentioned today.(Applause) Mr President, my team wishes to welcome the annual legislative program. However, the process worries us a bit. I went into this process as a relatively new member of the Parliament and I am distrustful of the different resolution plans of all groups, which all resemble lists of shopping lists of different size and materials. Indeed, in order to pull the transfer again and give the English expression, if we are going to use them to make meal, it will probably last a long time and will be difficult. I realize that tradition requires that we obey these lists. Personally, of course, I am not particularly radical or revolutionary, but my colleagues believe that something is missing from this process, especially at a time when we are trying to connect Europe again with its citizens, at a time when we want to give them a clear picture of what we do. Much has been said about our focus on basic tasks and to achieve better quality and no greater quantity in European law. All of this does not particularly match the endless lists. With these in mind, we wrote a resolution of a page that focuses on key points. But that did not reach the compromise resolution, so we now want to present a clear example of how we need to move on to this process in the future. Because it is a very important process and a moment in our legislative circle, and in order to enable the European Community and the parliament to approach it in a constructive manner, we would like to propose that the Union's annual report be combined with a resolution of the Parliament on key political priorities."	el
Mr. Swoboda's balanced and praise -worthy report joins this surprising and pleasing conclusion very concretely.The European Union knows what it has to do in Macedonia.Help this recent regional haven for thousands of war refugees to correctly play its role as stimulator of the desired stability pact for the Balkans.Mr. President, I have been concerning myself for eight years with the fate of Macedonia and I would like to contradict Mr. Dupuis.What we do here is in no way a masterpiece of hypocrisy.We intervened at the right time and I think the Macedonians are very happy.So stop being so detestable and pour a little water into your wine.I think we should approach the thing more positively.Macedonia did not participate in the war.On the other hand, she greatly suffered from the war that her neighbors were engaged and the sanctions which were precisely inflicted on them.She still suffers from it.She also suffered from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo War.This is why it should also be said that the development of Macedonia has, in a rather surprising way, continued to evolve on a democratic basis.It is a country which must overcome in the interior level of serious interethnic problems and which achieves it more and more conclusive.I would clearly like to specify that we can congratulate Macedonia for having designed and applying exemplary legislation today on respect for minorities.Taking into account the 30 % of Albanophones in government action, in government policy and in society represents the essential condition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.I am happy that the wish expressed by Mr. Swoboda in his report can be realized at the beginning of March, namely that a delegation of the EU ends up seeing the light of day and that we can finally restore the coat of arms of the European Union.The launch of negotiations relating to the stability and association process is in my opinion the logical conclusion of favorable development which has been carried out in this country.As part of our political commitment, Macedonia must finally be able to observe concretely that its own very meritorious regional cooperation is rewarded by the effective start of regional projects.I will quote just two of the low magnitude: the rapid resolution of the border post problem towards Kosovo in Blace and the development of corridor 8, which goes from Albania to Bulgaria via Macedonia.I find the report of my colleague Swoboda remarkable and I can only join it entirely.Mr. President, I too want to congratulate our Swoboda colleague for his report.I think it is good that many of us support the approach he chooses.This is a structural approach to stability in the region and it is also the content of the agreement provided for with the Republic of Macedonia which we debate today.If the concrete execution of the stability pact must still be set up, the commission has quickly taken care of developing the new instrument called stabilization and association agreement.	fr
The European Union must exercise its entire power over all of its instances so that these and other disputes are included.President!At the beginning of the week, President President announced that full employment will be one of the strategic goals of the Commission for the next five years.He admitted that there are currently 15 million job seeking Europeans and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.Even more, the Portuguese presidency sees the fight against unemployment as a top priority.But all too often, these political priorities are not visible in everyday politics.A typical case is the decision of the Commission to approve the association of ABB-Alstom.The new company has explained its intention to develop a restructuring plan with the aim of savings.This global restructuring plan could lead to loss of up to 12,000 jobs.Especially in my region of the United Kingdom, the consequences of the merger for employment as a result of the announcement of ABB-Alstom to save 270 jobs in Great Britain, of which 95 in Stafford and 112 in Rugby are lost.The company's failure to inform the works council about the merger proposals is particularly worrying.This is particularly important in the case of large international companies, where decisions are made far from the employee.Point 17 of the community's community chart of the social rights of the employees emphasizes the need for consultations, and it is added that this is particularly true in two or more member states.In my opinion, this is not just a community chart.EU law could not be more clear on this question.In such a situation, the Commission would really be good not to simply make its decision based on whether a merger will distort the competition, but also taking into account the social and economic consequences.We need a better coordinated policy in these questions.What we also urgently need is a study to evaluate the impact of mergers in every situation.This is the only way to respected Article 127 of the contract.I welcome the explanation of Commissioner Liikanians, but I also expect the support of this parliament to ensure that the laws we have adopted are strictly implemented on employee rights and that assessments on the effects of intended merger are a matter of course.I have received seven decision -making applications that were earned in accordance with Article 37 paragraph 2 of the rules of procedure.The vote takes place this evening.The pronunciation is closed.(The session is interrupted at 3:50 p.m. and re -accepted at 4:05 p.m.Racist and xenophobic riots in El Ejido (Spain) According to the agenda, the common pronunciation follows the following proposals: B5-0149/201 2000 by Mr. Galeote Quecedo and others on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats on the racist and xenophobic outbreaks in the area of ​​El Ejido (Spain);B5-0159/2000 of Messrs, Gasòliba I Böhm and Sánchez García on behalf of the faction of the liberal and democratic party of Europe about the racist and xenophobic riots in El Ejido (Spain);B5-0162/2000 by Ms. Díez González and others on behalf of the Group of the Social Democratic Party of Europe about the outbreak of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Almería);	de
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has already advanced in its orientations and the position of the Parliament does not weigh heavily in the programs of the period 2000-2006.However, it is necessary to emphasize the need for these funds to aim for priority to the development of countries and regions that encounter the most difficulties and ultraperipheral regions, such as the regions of Azores and Madeira in Portugal, with a view to reaching economic and social cohesion.The truth is that the orientations of the Commission do not fully fulfill these objectives.Furthermore, it is important that there are specific indications and sufficient funds in the fields of quality job creation and with rights, as well as the effective promotion of equal rights and opportunities, in support for the social and solidarity economy, rural development, small and medium -sized enterprises, improving the quality of the life of the urban populations of disadvantaged areas, especially in the social housing sector,sustainable urban development.If the contents of article 158 of the treaty are intended to promote the harmonious development of all communities, it must be said that the total deletion of disparities is still distant.In some cases, as for the Italian regions entering the objective 1, these disparities even increase paradoxically, especially because of the still low approach to community procedures on the part of the structural apparatus and because of the persistent endangered of procedures.Despite normative interventions, the relaxation of community structures must still be carried out.If we do not first carry out an administrative simplification, it is difficult to achieve the community objectives of reforms characterized by efficiency and concentration.In this sense, the Commission's document is incomplete, devoid of any recommendation to the Member States in order to simplify national procedures and legislation in matters of presentation and instruction of projects on the part of the national authorities, as well as in matters of financing, application and control.SMEs, micro-enterprises and craftsmen in particular are still ""weak subjects"", because for them, the legislative and administrative constraints imposed by certain Member States, including Italy, constitute large obstacles to access to structural funds.A large handicap lies in the inability and impossibility of regions and other subjects to program in time.This is why, the Commission, which should have consulted in time the Parliament, under the decision on guidelines 97/99 (Howitt report), in fact found a sort of easy alibi in the constitution of the reduced programming phase within the Member States and published the guidelines in July 1999, long before the newly elected parliament ends its legislative activities, thus preventing it from acting on the current fansDirectors.The intermediate assessment of article 42 of regulation 1260/99 will therefore take on significant importance.Current guidelines generally do not have the merit of being clear and transparent.They only touch up an important question, however: the possibility of measuring the progress made according to verifiable objectives and in total harmony with the strategies of community policies, and do not properly attach to the implications of enlargement, especially since they do not contain specific provisions or clarification in the matter, nor for the regional and national authorities, or for candidate countries."	fr
"We all agree on the conviction of intolerance, but also in the fact that one has to look ahead, and the guilty ones do not have to be sought here, in this parliament or in many other parliaments: the culprits of the events in El Ejido are this minority who wanted to satisfy their vengeance against some immigrants.But one has to take into account that solutions never arise from revenge.The solutions must arise from a functional, social integration and respect for all working there between all authorities and from a determined fight against illegal immigration and a comprehensive respect for the rights of foreign workers who work legally in El Ejido and throughout Europe.President!The present resolution is about solidarity with democratic forces in Spain that fight for the respect of human rights.All Spanish Democrats who feel violated by the events in their country will find our full, unrestricted support.Not only the immigrants were victims of worse riots, but also the democratic system in Spain has been kicked with feet, despite the enormous ability to develop that it has demonstrated in the past 20 years.Immigrants are essential for employers.Their working conditions are so hard and so inhumane that they are not accepted by any Spaniard.Extremely low wages, housing shortages - some live in cardboard huts - lack of opportunities for access to the social institutions, an effective existing apartheid situation - all of this is shameful, unacceptable and incompatible with the necessary respect for every human being.The events in El Ejido are nothing more than racist and xenophobic practices that are no longer permitted in today's Europe.The hunt for immigrants took four days.Women and children were beaten.Hundreds of immigrants who had fled from everywhere have fled to a hill on the edge of the city.It is correct that we put Haider's Austria on the index, but we can not tolerate that small, local ""Haiders"" pursue a policy of racist exclusion and the merciless economic dominance.What has happened in Spain can occur in all of our Union countries if we are not vigilant.We all have the duty to sweep on our own doorstep.I support the present request for resolution, in particular the digits relating to Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, as well as Section 11 of this resolution, in which a connection between the structural funds and the fight against exclusion is established.The European Parliament would be honored to judge these events and to support all proposals for respect for hiking workers in Spain and the entire Union.President, dear colleagues!In the heart of Europe, the flame of racist and xenophobic violence blows up today.This violence is fueled everywhere by extremist movements that gain in influence.We now have to take concrete measures in order to put an end to such violations of physical integrity.None of our societies in Europe can develop fully if it exists in the risk of hatred of hatred of a part of its population against the other part."	de
I can only call the Conference of Presidents to achieve an agreement as quickly as possible as to the right comitological procedure in terms of quotation.This would considerably facilitate the future work of the rapporteurs of this assembly.An amendment proposal was also advanced to the two reports of our colleague from Palacio.Unfortunately, I must say that I will not be able to support this proposal because it affects the substance of the result to which we have unanimously reached in legal committee and the internal market and that I would like to stick to this result from long discussions.To conclude, I thank all the colleagues who supported me, within the Legal Commission, during the development of these reports which were not really easy.I would particularly like to evoke Mr. Wieland, who assumed the ungrateful role of a ghost rapporteur and who took a much more important part than we used to do so to the development of this report by bringing excellent and constructive ideas, without being able to style the rapporteur's laurels.This is why I wanted to focus on this point in this enclosure.Mr. President, I am happy to have the possibility, after the rapporteur's intervention, Ms. Berger, to issue some preliminary remarks before listening, with all the attention required, the following speakers and, if you allow me, Mr. President, to lean more detailed on the various amendments at the end of the debate.Do you allow me to say that the Commission is delighted with the support manifested by the European Parliament with regard to the two proposals in the area of ​​free service for workers from third-party countries, a subject of which we are currently debating?I particularly thank Ms. Berger for the work which she devoted to the treatment of these two proposals which are politically sensitive and constitute a legal challenge.I also sincerely want to thank Ms. Palacio for the important contribution that she made as president of the Legal Commission and the internal market.The Commission is particularly delighted with the suggestions of the Parliament with a view to a more effective procedure for the delivery of the service provision.If the possibility is offered to request this card for one, several or all the Member States, the procedure becomes only more flexible.The Commission also agrees with the proposal to relax the validity duration of the card.However, I believe that a period of three months of work is insufficient to prove that a worker is established in a Member State.The Commission may also approve the determination of cases in which an employment contract concluded between a service provider and its employee is suddenly terminated.The effectiveness of the procedure for issuing this card implies that companies carrying out cross -border services can truly exercise their rights in the domestic territory.It seems exaggerated to give to other Member States, for reasons of public order, the systematic possibility of carrying out checks for the issuance of a card.	fr
"In order to enable further strengthening the role of the European Union as part of international development policy, we consider it necessary to develop three types of measures.The first thing is to increase the efficiency of your development policy.As is known, a overall assessment of development policy took place in 1995, and a conclusion of this overall assessment could be presented during the German Council Presidency.In the most important conclusions, the need for a more closed policy of the European Union and a general strategic perspective of the European Union is emphasized on developmental problems.A special accent is the need for closer coordination and stronger complementarity of the measures, a harmonization and simplification of the organizational framework, in which the Union's cooperation policy takes place today, an effective design of the management for the help and review of its intervention mechanisms, as well as the need to explain the evaluation system and explain it more openly, like this as a helpbecomes.A second aspect would be the need for a greater complementarity between the European Union and the politics of the individual Member States.As is well known, a significant part of the help of the measures of the Member States is used today, which do not always take place and coordinated.And it is precisely this inability to coordinate and complementarity between the projects of the Member States and the planned and carried out measures of the organs of the European Union is largely responsible for the fact that help from the space of the European Union is wasted or not effectively used.In our view, it is also imperative that we are able to do everything in the near future in order to expand mechanisms of complementarity and coordination of the politics and the politics of the European Union pursued by the Member States.A third -party aspect: strengthening and coherence in your policy, the central topic of the pronunciation provided today.First of all, it is clear to all of us that it is not sufficient to create cheaper conditions for the help, and that it is important to better link them with other measures of the European Union, so that the development goals can be achieved not only through help and support, but above all by an integrated view of the individual measures to be contributed to them.As is well known, a council decision was accepted in June 1997, the commission gave the promise to submit evaluation reports.The first report was sent to the Council in May 1999, and some aspects of the coordination of measures have already been determined, especially in the areas of peace insurance, food safety, fishing and migrations.However, as is also known, a communication from the Commission about the coherence together with the notification of ""development policy"" is expected.Of course, in the coming months, even during the Portuguese council chair, the contributions that the Commission on on this topic will also be presented with in the coming months can also be included.It is clear that the coherence of the policies will always remain limited, and of course a certain contradiction between the policies also represents an element of balance and weighing contradictory and contradictory interests that are only possible in the area of ​​the Union, and that it is only possible in this way to also affect a certain contradiction between the policies."	de
"This was never our intention.The fact that we take the negotiations first and before all others with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows that we can differentiate and do so.With regard to the regional aid mentioned in the report, we also believe that our technical and financial support should also benefit projects with cross -border or regional dimension.We advocate that an evolutionary clause for the access perspective should be included in the stabilization and association agreement.Such a clause reflects the position of the European Union defined in the conclusions of the European Council of Cologne with regard to its relationships with the countries of the western Balkans.We also consider the greatest possible decentralization of our aid programs to be necessary.As the MPs are known, we are currently developing a new regulation in relation to the support of the European Union for the countries of the western Balkans in order to simplify and rationalize the management of the programs and to summarize all measures in a regulation.I know that in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere, you are concerned about the end of the Phare program in these countries, in particular also about the task of the name Phare.I take note of the statements of the members on this topic with considerable concern.I will take a look at this problem again, although I would like to point out that there can really be a confusion with two Phare programs.However, I would like to emphasize that our support for the integration of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and its neighboring countries to the European family, regardless of the name of the program, is greater than ever.The members of this house certainly share my joy that Macedonia has reached this stage in a relatively short time.I hope that the other countries in the region will strengthen their efforts in order to be able to achieve similar progress.I am looking forward to the other debates that we will lead to this topic in the next few years, and I hope that the focus will be on the success of our efforts in the Balkans, because for me the Balkans is a test stone for what Europe can do in front of its own door.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Patten.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Agreement on the committee proceedings according to the agenda follows the report (A5-0021/2000) by Ms. Frassoni on behalf of the committee for constitutional questions about the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the modalities of the application of the new decision of the Council of June 28, 1999 - ""Comitology"" (1999/468/EG).Mr President, with the assumption of this agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the modalities of the application of the decision regarding the Council, we bring a matter of under roof and subject, which have been scattered by the various institutions of the European Union and are referred to by some of them as a masochist.Since 1993, the modalities for the exercise of the implementation powers transferred to the Commission and in particular the unfathomable and even dubious committee system have sown discord and suspect between the institutions, which threatened to have a serious impact on the legislative process."	de
Question 45 (H-20208/00): Subject: China's joining the World Trade Organization in accordance with the Commission's Commission's Commission on Conference Isn't the Commission's accession agreement to the world trade organization so important that it should be justified by the current Parliament? Does the Commission accept that China's joining the world trade organization will be subjected to the current Parliament for approval, even though the inter -governmental conference has not yet been completed?.(FR) Member Clegg, Commission admits that an agreement on China's joining WTO is an extremely important decision. Moreover, it is a type of type of agreement that would be subject to the approval procedure if the proposals made by the Commission for the inter -governmental conference were obtained by the approval of the Member States. Now, however, it is so that at this stage is only proposals, and the Commission cannot violate existing rules, which are provided for in the agreement of the Communities, nor can it anticipate decisions that Member States make in the inter -governmental conference. However, if it is necessary to take into account the considerations related to the services of the Chinese accession agreement, the contract would, in principle, would in principle be subject to the consultation procedure in Article 300. As a result, Parliament should have the opportunity to comment on this agreement under Article 300. Of course, hearing the European Parliament is, as usual, the council's mission. Member Clegg, this is the legal and institutions answer to your question. As for more practical aspects, I recall my efforts to find the way it makes its voice heard in these negotiations with the European Parliament. I have said this several times, and this is important to me for the relationship between the Commission and the Parliament, and it is also important for the negotiator's efficiency and influence in this type of matter. So I am completely ready, as always, to discuss this topic a little more thoroughly in the competent committee of Parliament. Many thanks for your answer. You allow me to repeat my satisfaction with the fact that the Commission and Parliament first unanimously speak to the role of Parliament about changes in important trade agreements. I would just like to ask you a non-legal and institutional question: If we look at the decision, for example, the decision to submit the Uruguay negotiating round to the parliamentary approval procedure, there were a few legal issues of the contract's institutionTo the words, stretches to get the contract subordinate to the approval procedure of the Parliament. My own view is that China's joining the world's trade organization, although it may not be as striking as a multilateral agreement, is just as important for future world trade, and that both Parliament and the Commission could adopt a similar political position. I would advise you to do so. I would ask you what you think we could do together to promote such actions..(Fr) Member Clegg, I agree with you that China's joining WTO would and is, no matter what the time of joining at any time, is extremely important. After saying this, I think it is not fully justified to compare the issue with the Uruguay round. The Uruguay tour, and especially the establishment of a dispute solution system, meant an institutional leap in international law, which, in accordance with the basic agreement, provided an undeniable basis for the application of the approval procedure. For China, it is a legally procedure in which one country relates to WTO, a procedure that progresses relatively balanced and known and has not so far caused objects. So I assume that the Council will hesitate to ask for a favorable statement, as it is not the case of the Council to go beyond the requirements of the Treaties in the hearing of the Parliament. For both of us, it is important that we can discuss when the opportunity arises, either in the Committee or in the plenary session, hopefully the same ones we have agreed with the People's Republic of China, and that we can do so openly.	fi
I would like to know what Europe and you, Mr. Solana, are currently doing it or commemorating in the near future to ban this danger of war: today you can still prevent her - tomorrow it could be too late for it.I would also like to know whether something could not be done in this context to move the Iraqi government into a humanitarian gesture, i.h.that she gives up the whereabouts of the 615 people missing from Kuwait or expenses them if they are in their violence.As we are sitting here, hundreds of thousands of people are in great danger because of the floods in Mozambique.This has not suddenly happened.The floods have been ongoing for weeks, and only now seems to have emerged.The practical support from the community and the Member States has so far been more than modest.For a long time, many have warned that the European Union spends too much time with its potentially dangerous and essentially political project of creating military decision -making structures instead of concentrating their efforts to improve their civilian instruments, especially for humanitarian aid.I recognize the efforts of Mr. Patten in this direction, but it is very unfortunate that the governments of the Member States have not invested as much time to analyze their capacities for disaster relief and humanitarian aid, as they did in the dangerous business of creating military capacity, with which ultimately only parallel structures are created and thus undermined.Of course, there is a connection between the availability of the device and teams and humanitarian aid, but in the armed forces of many European countries there are serious defects in the military area, and for a long time.In NATO, they have started to fix them.So far I have not heard a convincing declaration on security policy, which is why the European Union has to set up autonomous, decision-making capacities for the use of armed forces outside the NATO structures if it does not want to create committees that NATO should compete with.After all, the EU member states are either full-fledged members of NATO, or they are sitting at the table of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.NATO mostly bears European character.At the end, I would like to ask you, Mr. Solana, the question of what the sense is to have the frequently announced strategy planning and early warning unit in the Council Secretariat, if we still react completely surprised when another humanitarian disaster breaks out?President, Mr. Hoher representative, Mr. Commissioner, we have taken note of the particularly reserved and almost compliant attitude of the international community in general and the European Union in particular about the war in Chechnya.What happened in Chechnya and is still happening, but is comparable to genocide.How different should one denote the complete annihilation of a regional capital with 400,000 inhabitants, the incessant and excessive shelling of towns, villages, where - perhaps mixed with some Chechen fighters - the entire civilian population was called?How should one describe the shameful cz -like filtration camps in which the population is exposed to worst humiliations and from which healthy men between the ages of 15 and 65 rarely come out alive?	de
I share its impatience with regard to guaranteeing the total implementation of reform mechanisms and change practices.I would like to be able to honestly tell him that we will write and that we will present communication proposals before 2001 and that we will certainly implement them before 2002, but he must know that consultation procedures and deadlines are legally required and that we must respect them.I don't use it as an excuse.The very positive and constructive answer resulting from the consultation, last month, strongly encourages us, and I believe, therefore, that although the compilation and application of reforms are a slight delay, these reforms will nevertheless be reinforced by the extent of the understanding and commitment which will result from this consultation, consultation that we will assiduously lead.I would like everything to take place much faster.It is better to do it absolutely adequately.Madam President, we admire the vision and realism of Mr. Kinnock because, if he makes us mirroy an efficient and working administration, he does not fail to emphasize the difficulties that will arise and which we must already expect.Mr. Prodi noted that he wanted to disengage from certain tasks.Policy priorities must therefore be defined.I think it is more important to determine what you want to do before you disengage, to avoid putting a large number of people on the back.This is my opinion.In addition, the enlargement of the Union is one of the major challenges.I would also like to point out that peacekeeping will require greater efforts so that a number of people are committed to this ground.The fairly bureaucratic approach that we currently know, in particular in terms of all of our development cooperation, will have to resolutely give way to peacekeeping for peace.Can Kinnock explain what he expects from the Council and the Parliament about the timing of such priorities?I thank Ms. Maes not only for the declaration she has just made, but also for the continuous commitment to which she has shown in favor of the change, since she was part of this assembly.I would like to assure him that our behavior is not guided by any desire to get rid of certain tasks.We focus on essential tasks, on priorities, not in order to elude any obligation, but to guarantee absolutely that we can fully fulfill the central obligations that we have.One of these obligations is very clear - and I agree with Ms. Maes here - it is the preparation for an effective, serene and gentle enlargement, a widening which will serve mutual interests both of the peoples of the adherent countries and the citizens of the current union.Being able to guarantee that we are able to fulfill this absolutely critical role of agents responsible for the widest enlargement which is one of the reasons why we must ensure that we focus very strongly and very intensely on our priorities.	fr
There is no equivocal silence from the council on this subject, Mr. Wurtz.The Council assumes on this subject all the responsibility for the reading he makes of the situation in Cyprus.It was this situation and this reading that decided it, in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, to start the membership process of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union.I would like you to understand that, regardless of decision -making of a more or less emotional nature on this type of question, the daily life of international negotiations normally obliges governments when I say governments I mean all governments to have a slightly more flexible reading.We indeed need positions of a more emotional nature to maintain the scenario in which all these questions projection on the human level.But we must also keep in mind that it is thanks to the rational character of political positions and the flexibility of negotiation that we can find solutions to overcome the big disputes, ultimately originally from certain great tragedies of history.Regardless of the culprits - we are not here to list the culprits, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear - I believe that we must enjoy, without emotions and with more rationality, opportunities offered by the new situation.The Helsinki European Council has had the courage to make certain decisions and I believe that different parts of these decisions already take up these opportunities duly in that they can, as I said at the start of my introductory intervention, constitute a window of ooportity.It is not by exploiting the tensions, in this negotiation phase, which is a delicate phase, a sensitive phase, that we can obtain concrete results.It is precisely through discreet work, support work of the mission of the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General that we must continue.The position of the European Union in the matter is unequivocal, ladies and gentlemen, and I believe that it is not worth engaging in second readings on possible sentences which could be in the discourse of the council or in another position.We do not play, within this parliament, in politically correct, we play for international level and for what the concrete positions are, defined by the Council, for a long time and consistently, and which the European Commission has also followed with prudence, attention and pragmatism.When we are currently talking about the need to involve the community of the northern part of Cyprus in an exchange of information, in particular on the way to a future membership of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we must know that we are trying to find formulas of a practical nature allowing us to overcome obstacles on the path of a political solution.We are not looking for subterfuges and we do not seek to create, through practical solutions, any models presenting recognition of a political nature.	fr
However, technical assistance remains necessary.It will also be necessary to pay particular attention to the dissemination of results and mutual learning through best practices and mainstreaming.I made sure that the present report meets the widest possible adhesion.This objective has led to the reduction of a number of amendments - from 100 to committee to 22 for the plenary -, which has given rise to numerous compromise possibilities.We even managed to reach a compromise on the issue of asylum seekers.On this subject, however, I ask the president to vote on the equal report on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, so that we can still work on certain points of detail.It seems important to me that this community initiative can start in time and that this report has a large support within this assembly, so that the Commission is also required to take the constructive proposals of the Parliament in consideration.The means intended for Equal have indeed been put in reserve by the European Parliament, so that the expectations of parliamentarians can also affect the community initiative.On this subject, the insistence shown by the European Parliament for a modification of the essential points can only take place after a new hearing of the Assembly is also justified.Equal must deserve his name, this is my firm intention.He must guarantee equal opportunities for all disadvantaged persons from the European Union.He must prevent the dislocation of our society.He must prevent marginalization from being part of everyday life.He must offer anyone the possibility of enjoying a common initiative, regardless of their age, sex and origin.It is my intention and I ask this assembly to provide the widest support to this report.Madam President, the fact that we were taking this debate on the new Urban initiative is a feat in itself, just like my presence among you this evening since Iir France canceled my flight at 2:10 p.m., but I am there!Just a year ago, when the Commission presented its proposals relating to the 2000 agenda, it suppressed the Urban initiative.However, we knew, as men and politicians, that there was a deep support in favor of the continuation of this initiative in the year 2000. Consequently, the Parliament may claim to have carried out a productive pressure campaign aimed at the reintegration of Urban in the order of the day and to have succeeded in changing the commission and the Council to change.Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a white paper and a Government Task force on urban development examines the problems of urban communities.Eight out of ten people in Europe live in urban areas, so it is just to help our most disadvantaged communities to solve the problems that are far too familiar such as deficiencies, social exclusion, unemployment, crime, drug addiction, and all the problems resulting from it.For example, in my region, in Manchester, the Urban community initiative was fruitful.	fr
"Above all, integration mechanisms should be created.The most important thing is perhaps the development of an infrastructure that is such that the non-expansive industries and peripheral population groups can also participate.That is why, in my opinion, the computer equipment of the primary schools, a broadband network for the thin -populated areas, public technical libraries and a public sector should be invested, which must not be reduced, but on the contrary must be strengthened.President!You can only become dizzy on the agenda of the European Council in Lisbon, which takes place on March 23 and 24 March.This only applies to the chapter headings in which the Europe of innovation and knowledge, structural reforms, competitiveness, the European social model, employment, social cohesion, macroeconomic politics and sustainable economic growth are called.It is therefore not surprising that the numerous contributions of the chair, the Commission and the Member States are tend to get bogged down in all directions at the moment.This procedure can lead to two completely different results: Either a comprehensive exchange of very stimulating thoughts is made possible, which everyone then tries to implement, whereby in the new area of ​​electronic business transactions could be taken, - and this possibility would ultimately not be so bad - or the Council wants to show the results of the species that further responsibilities are transferred to Europe, i.e. that is, more centralization and bureaucracydignity what would actually be necessary.When we read the preparatory documents, some fears come to us.From this we-sorry for this gibberish, which does not come from me-that it is a better convergence of the Cologne process regarding the coordination of the macroeconomic policies, the cardiff process regarding structural reforms and the Luxembourg process with regard to the coordination of the employment policies, while also the employment pact and multilateral monitoring of theHousehold policies with a substance in content.How can such a better convergence of all of these different processes be ensured?In the conclusion of the document of the Council Presidency on January 12, the key is delivered.The basics of economic policy - which currently only have the status of annual recommendations to the council to the Member States - would have to be reformed in order to expand their scope and, above all, I quote: ""To form their character as a framework even more"".The word ""frame"" should obviously be understood in its double meaning, namely as a summary and obligation.Are we not with these total documents to reinvent the GOSPLAN?This question is justified, especially if you read the French contribution, which goes a little further towards Dirigism, by proposing to coordinate a whole series of national policies, for example in the areas of employment, social security and SME, in Brussels and to present a wealth of quantified indicators, which then be monitored.Such a central control would lead to renewed violations of the principle of subsidiarity, to re -standardization of details, to other coordination, which, despite their different situations, ultimately lead to new rigid rules that would still be added to those in the area of ​​uniform currency."	de
"Italy, for example, in recent years, has encountered difficulties in the use of structural funds, especially due to excessive bureaucracy, a lack of information and the almost absent involvement of economic and social operators at the local level.There are therefore two points to which I would like to attract the attention of the Commission: first of all, it is necessary to use the consultation as best as an instrument of coordination and participation in the decisions of local and regional operators, precisely in order to avoid imbalances and inequalities.Second, it is really necessary to simplify and make administrative processes more transparent, which too often present an unnecessary length and complexity to the point of prejudice access to funds, something of which small and medium -sized European enterprises complain.I conclude, Mr. President, claiming that it is quite serious that the Commission, in his communication, has only paid little attention to territorial pacts and especially to the methods of combating unemployment among women and young people.Mr. President, like my colleague, Mr. Evans, I am delighted that the first speech that I come to pronounce before this assembly relates to such an important subject, in particular because I represent part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has so far benefited from the funds of lens 2. But the report presented this evening in the Parliament is an excellent example of what, if we do not see,Lack of the substance necessary to be relevant for people by benefiting directly.The report itself starts from a good intention, but, as often happens when we deal with these subjects, lacks clarity as to its objective and a solid base for its operation.This is why my group and I offer three key amendments and additions to the text.It is not a question of removing anything from the proposal but of making it more relevant for those which it intends to guide.I would like to explain our thought.First, we care about the proper use of structural funds and the cohesion fund.The experience of the past shows that we should and we must, as elected deputies of European taxpayers, demand financial probity and transparency in the payment and control of the sums allocated.Our amendments and adds therefore aim to establish indicators of what we know under the expression ""to have it for your money"" in the process of granting credits.Then, we see far too often that we spend huge sums in projects whose outcome is inevitably uncertain at the start of the program period.But halfway through or at the end of this period, there is no effective way to put an end to the project if it has not been fruitful.Our additions therefore require that practical and applicable exit strategies are provided, so that not only can we have the necessary insurance against continuous costs that taxpayers must often bear, but also that we can avoid the syndrome which consists in a bad deal.Finally, we ask for a change in balance and the method of payment of funds."	fr
I would also like to praise the reasonable and flexible attitude of the council.Save according to the agenda is followed by Ms. Ahern (A5-0010/2000) on behalf of the delegation of the parliament in the mediation committee about the joint draft for a decision by the European Parliament and the Council on a multi -year program for the promotion of energy efficiency - Save (C5-0334/1997/0371 (COD)).Ms. President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the successful and thorough implementation of the mediation procedure, in which there was a good atmosphere all the time, which is not always the case.I am pleased to be able to say that I consider the end result to be very satisfactory for the parliament, since all of its amendments have been included in the common text in full or in revised form.The funds ultimately estimated for the program represent a significant improvement compared to the council's proposal in the second reading, which we considered completely unacceptable;We made some progress there.I therefore propose to this house to agree to the suggestions for Save and the conclusion from the mediation in the third reading.I would like to remind the house that we had accepted this report with eight amendments to the second reading, including the reinstatement of the amount originally mentioned by the Commission.The Commission had accepted five of the proposed amendments, including the middle equipment, and I would like to thank the Commission for their continued support in the budget during the mediation procedure, since the council's proposal was unacceptable.In the course of the placement, an agreement on the studies and actions for elaboration, implementation, supplement and evaluation of the measures of the community could be achieved.Furthermore, compromise formulations were found for five further change applications, including the legislative and non -legislative measures, the inclusion of local energy centers and - very important - from energy balance systems in monitoring progress in the area of ​​energy efficiency.I hope you all agree that this is enormous progress.In the question of financial resources, the Parliament steadfastly defended its position in view of the extremely lean initial offer of the Council.To do this, we had to hold several sessions until the Council finally increased the funds on a noteworthy amount.We enforced an increase by two million compared to the initial amount, which is equivalent to a significant increase in the middle equipment.I can recommend this central equipment and the Commission has promised to follow the program afterwards.This played an important role in our considerations.However, I would like to make it clear that this is a very modest financial framework and has always been and that the financing is more symbolic than corresponds to the real requirements.The financing of the energy savings still comes from the Member States for the most part.We have to keep that in mind when we say goodbye to this program.If what we can achieve at community level is more symbolic than real, it is unfortunate because there is a lot of enthusiasm for measures, including community measures, for energy saving at the local level.However, the community can do one thing, namely to bring the local actors into contact with each other so that the wheel is not reinvented in every region.	de
We warn that this coalition, if formed today, legitimizes the far right, which is in direct confrontation with the principles of peace and reconciliation that unite us within the European Union. These are the values ​​we ask from those who wish to unite with us. This European Parliament calls for the European Commission's vigilance of any racist action in Austria and threatens to suspend Austria as a member of the European Union if this happens. I proudly support such a resolution. Although our proposal has not yet been accepted to revoke political invitations to any Austrian government's representative in this European Parliament, I note that we will insist on this proposal in order to ensure that any kind of action can and will be taken within the context of the European Parliament. I intervene very soon, Mrs. President. I respect the will of Parliament as it was, but I must add that the self -determination of the peoples cannot be disputed either by the European Parliament. The text is unfair to Austrian colleagues, Members both national and European, and stinks from afar jealousy, political interests, and commercial deals. I do not think that citizens' indifference to Europe is treated with these actions. We made an unjustified gift to the far right of Austria. I very much appreciated the position of the Italian radicals. And I say this by clearly proclaiming the historical and meaningful difference between the Italians and the Austrian radicals. For many years I have been, both in words and by actions, actively in the anti -fascist struggle, as well as in the struggle for equal rights and against racism. But I do not agree with what is happening lately, first with what was actually threats on the part of the Council of Ministers, then with Mr Prodi's threats and finally with this resolution. It was impossible for me to vote in favor of this resolution, despite all I agree with many of the principles on which it is based. First of all, it is an unthinkable and extremely bad blend of power, arrogance and embarrassment on the part of the European Union. Not only do these decisions come to conflict with the treaty and give the union institutions more power than properly, but the worst thing is that they will have exactly the opposite effect of the desired. They are not going to weaken Mr Haider and Austria's liberal party. On the contrary, they will strengthen them. We will do just the opposite. This is not the case with racism and the turn to the right. Members of the European Parliament's left emphasize that in today's resolution, Parliament does not support the diplomatic sanctions of the 14 prime ministers against Austria. Consequently, Members of Parliament in Parliament have supported the liberal resolution that clearly separates our position from any form of racism in Austria and elsewhere. We emphasize the enormous importance for the need to use the new provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam, if necessary, so that a country that violates the fundamental rights of the citizen, such as:With discrimination and so on, the right to vote to the EU Ministers' Council (Article 7).	el
But what will happen to an extremely expanded Europe, where the differences will be even more intense than they are today both socially and budget? That is why we propose an extremely clear, I would say almost clinical, examining these issues based on the interest of the internal market. Finally, I thank Professor Tsatsos, who reminded us of the existing relationship between these proposals and the role of the European Parliament. Since I am given the opportunity, I would like to confirm that one of the committee's proposals consists of directly correlating the co -fascination with all measures taken by a special majority, in the case of legislative measures. We are clearly seeing through these issues related to the internal market - social security and taxation - and its good operation that there is a legitimate field to express and take the European Parliament. In the coming months we will have other opportunities, Mr. Professors, to see it again and try to convince other negotiators. Mr President, Mr Barnier Commissioner, I am particularly welcomed by this Commission's initiative. It is clear that for the internal market and the monetary union requires the coordination of tax policy. Anyone who refuses to dispute the inner market in the long run. Now mention special information on VAT. I believe that there are two other taxes being discussed for a long time: the tax on interest rates and the tax on businesses. These are, of course, basic taxes, but which needs to be found to be harmonized. I don't know if you included them in tax evasion. In your document at least there is no such thing. Can you say something about? Mr President, I must say that I have been very impressed by the principles that the Commissioner has exposed. If we can limit the specific amendments to the rules for a special majority in cases related to the functioning of the internal market, in accordance with the practice created by the court and in accordance with the minimum requirements, then I really think that these amendments will be possible to approve all states, which is extremely important. At the same time, I should point out that if it retains these three good principles, then at some point in the future it will be in contradiction with the memorandum submitted by the Presidency. The presidency, of course, made a proposal, which will apply to a special majority in the areas covered by Article 137 (3), Part Two (point 2?), Which relates to the termination of a contract of employment (in the text the article refers to two times. I find it difficult to see what the justification is based on the three submitted authorities pointed out by the Commissioner. Can I conclude on all of this that the Commissioner does not want to follow the Presidency Memorandum on these proposals? Mr Commissioner, go very carefully and so I support your effort. Regarding the argument of supplementary, I would just like to tell you that in my opinion it is equally important to highlight the argument of citizenship on these tax issues.	el
"Due to the size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets, it is becoming increasingly difficult to master the economy at national and regional level.Computer -controlled sales programs were sufficient to turn a random flashing into an avalanche on the screen, under which jobs, life and entire industry were buried in all parts of the world.The only arguments that speak against them are: First, the efficiency of the foreign exchange markets would be affected - one can hardly imagine in view of the enormous pace with which capital is moved back and forth and the annihilation of jobs all over the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.Mr. Chirac has once referred to those who are involved in this business as the AIDS virus of the global economy.We have to sprinkle a little sand in the gearbox of currency speculators, stock exchange brokers and option dealers.Of course, this cannot achieve a single country nor the currency union, but it is possible at an international level and through worldwide cooperation.In my view, Europe, Japan and the United States, the euro, the Yen and the dollar would be such a block.I am disappointed with the PPE.I thought the members would at least read the applications for the resolution they want to vote on.Yes, I support such a tax, but we won't vote on that tomorrow.Tomorrow we will only decide whether the Commission should be commissioned to examine this area and check which steps and requirements would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.As far as I heard, the commission member also rejects such a tax.However, I cannot understand why he does not welcome a study of this topic, because after all, the result could underpin his position.There is nothing worse than a prefabricated opinion.According to a survey by ""War on Want"", 47 % of all citizens in the United Kingdom support this tax.In France, this proposal has come across an overwhelming response, especially in connection with the claim to use the income to reduce debts and to relieve poverty in the Third World.This topic can no longer be ignored by Parliament, Council and the Commission.A large part of the public now requires a better answer than: ""There has never been such a tax."" In the new millennium with its new problems, which require global solutions, the citizens demand good arguments, which is why such a tax cannot be introduced, and they do not want to hear what reasons so far.Ms. President, Commissioner, Varier colleagues, a political compromise from the benefits of taxation of international financial transactions would be a first step towards the indispensable redesign of numerous international regulations.One of the most important demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was exactly the introduction of this type of tax, and this is no coincidence.Proposing them now would be a strong signal of the rich European countries that show that they want to give up their selfish attitude, Mr. Commissioner.According to everyone, such a solidarity tax represents a commendable measure that does not hinder trade, but primarily aims at speculation transactions and their bad effects, revered colleagues from the right -wing parties."	de
My contact with very large European and multinational companies in Europe has shown tragic results. There are businesses at European level that employ thousands of workers, many times hundreds of thousands of workers worldwide, and at the management and management level, women's participation is less than 2%! We should not underestimate women's participation in financial decision -making centers. And, of course, there will also be a specific effort, which of course cannot be legislated, but can work on the basis of the exchange of the best practices and in any case my first contact with the presidents and directors of these very large businesses had a positive result. As you know, the committee makes an effort to deal with the problem inside. There is already a decision to participate 40% of each sex in all groups and in all programs related to research and technological development. It is something that has been approved by your own institution in May 1999, where the need for women in research and technology was emphasized. We are obliged by the Commission to give a specific and clear example and there is a cooperation with all fellow commissioners, as it is shown in the Commission's reform, so that women's participation can reach 40% in all European Commission Committees. Ladies and gentlemen, there are often objections, and these objections have a progressive cloak, whether there should be binding obligations for women's involvement in power. No one ever wonders in a federal state if all the states of the federation should be expressed. And at the European Union level, the question would never be asked if the 15 Member States could not be represented in each committee. So it is strange and why we have reservations about whether there should be a legislative commitment to represent half of the population. I would like to be absolutely categorical here. There should be no reservation, no reservation for the legislative commitment to women's participation in the centers of power.(Applause) Women are half the population, half of the power of the planet. The exclusion of women from power means, first of all, a democratic deficit and, secondly, the underlying human resources. We have a unique challenge ahead of us and the times are mature: to combine economic and political utility with the observance of basic democratic principles. I am optimistic that we will succeed. The bet we have in front of us is the bet with time. There should be no other generations of women on the sidelines. If necessary, we must in every way rush the situations.(Applause) (ppe-de).(Es) Mr President, I would like to start my speech by expressing my gratitude to the Mrs. Minister, chairman of the Council, for her participation in this discussion and for her interesting intervention on the subject. I would also like to express my gratitude to the Mrs. Commissioner who was with us and for the words she addressed. The various political groups are generally agreeing on the fact that it is easily found, of the under -representation of women in decision -making processes, both in the field of politics and in the economy and society. No one denying today that women are involved in political life, parties and institutions, but it is not easy to agree on the way this participation must be achieved.	el
"Things being clear, it is now necessary to hope that the improvement in the climate of relations between the European Union and Turkey and Greco-Turkish relations will favorably influence the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will raise its refusal to send representatives to the membership negotiations.The presence of such representatives would in no way prejudge the final political solution.On the contrary.It would enable the interests of all at a time when Cyprus, inserting itself into the European Union, is about to take a decisive turning point in its history.Mr. President, I would also like to associate myself with the joy expressed by the other speakers with regard to the best possibilities available in the continuation of the development of Cyprus as relations between Turkey and the EU as well as between Turkey and Greece.In my opinion, the EU must constructively contribute to this evolution.I also consider it - and this point has already been mentioned - that certain problems related to the financial regulations should be resolved.I mean here pre -prédhesion credits, which in my opinion, in my opinion, section 7. The assembly had exceptionally accepted last year to place the credits intended for these expenses in section 4 so that Cyprus and Malta are not treated as an equal with the candidates from Central and Eastern Europe when they should be in accordance with the declarations made at the Helsinki summit.Resources must therefore be assigned to section 7 for which financial prospects must be revised.This is the salient point.It is essential that the credits allocated as a help of pre -pricing for Cyprus and Malta come from section 7 and that financial prospects are the subject of a revision, because if the council refuses this principle, it will act in contradiction with its own decisions taken in Helsinki in December.As for the amount which appears in the Brok report - 130 million euros - I would like to declare, on behalf of the Liberal group, that we must first negotiate the volume of this amount.The main thing, in this regard, is to guarantee a multi -year program, which is part of the adequate section in order to start the preparations for membership of Cyprus and Malta.Mr. President, the Greens of Greens/European Free Alliance supports the decision adopted by the European Council of Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot constitute a preliminary condition for the membership of Cyprus.It is necessary to maintain a strong pressure on the Cypriot government, but the will of the majority of the population cannot be the subject of a blackmail of another part of it, even if we emit great doubts about the representativeness of the government of this part of the island.It is obvious that the opportunity window - the ""Janela de Oportunidades"", of which the presidency spoke - must be exploited to the maximum.However, we are also convinced that, although Greco-Turkish relationships have improved, this cannot be sufficient."	fr
Berger report (A5-0007/2000) This proposal for a directive aims to establish the conditions for the detachment of salaried workers nationals of a third state as part of a delivery of cross-border services.Indeed, nationals of third countries legally staying in a Member State do not enjoy the right to free movement within the European Union.Until now, extracommunications workers have been seriously faced with obstacles to their free movement within the European Union.It is therefore positive that we facilitate the circulation of workers in the European Union, even if they are nationals of third countries.However, the proposal for a directive targets only their displacement in another Member State if they are in detachment regime on behalf of an employer established in a country where he has his usual residence, so that the possibility of circulating is limited to the detachment period, and only in the Member State where it was detached.This means that the fundamental concern for this proposal is not to solve the problem of circulation of these workers but only to create better conditions for companies providing services.On the other hand, the Berger report introduces, in the name of the simplification of procedures, questionable profound changes, in particular the creation of a common information system giving access to the cards issued by the authorities of all the Member States Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger (A5-0012/2000).It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives which aim to facilitate the free movement of working -class workers from third countries while facilitating the free movement of services.Essentially, these proposals introduce the service service/which will allow, in the future, nearly 5 million third -party nationals legally residing in a Member State of the European Union, to provide services in other Member States, something to which problems are today, such as obtaining visas and work permit.The first proposal for a directive will authorize companies established in a Member State who employ third -party working -class workers to temporarily detach these employees in another Member State to provide services.Under the provisions provided, the employer would simply be required to apply for a service provision for each worker concerned.Logically, to be able to hold such a card, the worker must reside legally in a member state and be covered by a social security scheme.The second proposal gives the same rights to the self -employed workers from third countries.If, on the merits, I adhere to the proposals of the European Commission, it is true that certain provisions could be confusing.This is why, I vote in favor of the amendments deposited by the rapporteur.This will clarify the provisions and thus prevent any abuse!Other amendments aim to simplify administrative procedures, for example by authorizing the Member States to appoint a single authority responsible for the issuance of cards.Such a modification seemed essential to me to avoid administrative heaviness which too often slow down the right application of new provisions.	fr
That is our job for the Balkans.The Union must prove its ability to expand the space of security, peace and freedom and to play a major role on the world stage to the Balkans and the rest of the world.Of course, we come back to the expansion again, which must be realized by expanding the space of security, peace and freedom at the same time.We promised a lot in this direction, but I think that we can keep our promises, although there is an extremely difficult way to get ahead.The expansion that will accompany us for the entire five years and beyond - I think of the hopes of the accession candidates - must take place on the basis of secure and objective criteria, although we also have to offer guarantees to the citizens in these countries and more.The expansion will be characterized by friendship, impartiality and opening, but also by compromise.I say it again: We have to offer the citizens in the countries willing to join, but even more public in our countries.Our responsibility does not end during the expansion, it does not end in the Balkans.There are some other problems of essential importance: the relationship to Ukraine, the relationship with Russia, our neighboring countries, or the big problem of the relationship to the southern Mediterranean area, which will be decisive for the history of Europe, for peace and security for future European generations.In this sense, we are responsible for the entire African continent.Africa has recently hoped that Africa has been submitted, but nothing concrete has been accomplished there;In Africa, no transition from totalitarian to democratic regimes, but vice versa from democracy to totalitarianism in recent years;For us, Africa is a worrying conflict stove.That is why we have to perform another task at an international level that has already been addressed by the responsible commissioner for trade: We have to work for the resumption of the millennium round, with a comprehensive willingness, as we had already adopted and suggested it before Seattle, which we were unable to put into practice - the willingness to take on some problems for the poorest countries, whichNot only affect debt, but also the one -sided opening for trading with the poorest countries in the world.We have to find a different solution, otherwise events like those in Seattle will repeat themselves and prevent the Union from playing a positive role in history.The Union has to be guided by respect to the principles of freedom, respect for human rights and the rights of minorities in the world.Let us remember that we, the European Union, are a Union of minorities: we are all minorities in Europe.Benefits are also noticeable among us fifteen, which can also be repeated in the coming decade.I speak of Austria, where the Commission lived up to its role, which consists of acting for the cohesion of the Union, but this is uncompromising and as a guardian of the contracts, ready to punish every little violation of the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for minorities.	de
The Parliamentary Committee rejected this proposal for discrimination and decided to join the Equal program on equal terms. However, some in the parliamentary committee have been solidarity with Mrs Stenzel's proposals and wording. In my view, this means that Haider policy is already beginning to find foundations in this parliament. For this reason, it is crucial for the plenary to make the plenary clear with the greatest possible emphasis that the Equal program will include all refugees. Finally, I would like to state that, last week, when we were discussing the formation of the government in Austria, I had some doubts, but I have no hesitation when we are going to discuss and criticize Austria's policy for refugees. I hope that active plenary participation will be just as intense this time. Mr President, during the EU's previous fiscal prospects from 1994 to 1999, when 13 different initiatives had been activated, the Interreg II cross -border program was an important initiative. The fact that the next round of structural funds, from 2000 to 2006, includes the Interreg initiative, I consider to be a very clear indication of the importance of EU Member States at national level. The Interreg I program, from 1989 to 1993, and the Interreg II program, from 1994 to 1999, proved to be absolutely successful in the approach of social and economic development between the border Member States. Coming from the border counties in the northwest of Ireland, I have seen all these years the important role played by INTERREG I and II, and I am pleased with Interreg III. The Commission will grant £ 67m for the Interreg III program, which will be allocated to continue the development of cross -border economic plans between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland. The European Union has played a key role in the development of the Irish District Border County over the years. The European Union is the largest single pounds, with £ 80m, of the International Fund for Ireland. The European Union contributes 75% to the peace and reconciliation program. Overall, the Interreg, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation program have all played an important role in the evolving peace process. Mr President, I will talk about the interreg limited to some critical aspects, to obviously respect the time limits of my intervention. We have all expressed a positive evaluation of the confirmation of this program and the expansion of the fields of action, not only in cross -border cooperation but also in transnational and interregional cooperation. This does not mean, however, that we are not aware of the fact that most of the resources - 50-80% - will be allocated for cross -border cooperation, for chapter A of the Interreg III program; also the option that was preferred, to rely on this chapter today's cooperation fields, in terms of the choice of eligible areas. We hope and hope that the Commission will want to insist on this matter and to substantially recognize, and not as a formal indication of respect, the position of Parliament.	el
"By the way, we apologize for the same text in paragraph 5 of Ludford's racism and xenophobia. From the same perspective, Flander states that the European Charter of Regional Languages ​​or Minority Languages ​​mentioned in paragraph 20 of the Haarder's report does not apply to the position of French in the border, but for example the Limburg dialect (in the Netherlands it has been recognized for this Charter) or in Luxemburg, the Arrel German..(IT) is truly disgusting - without taking a stand on accepted or abandoned checks and deleted or modified points that, as a sensitive and urgent defense of human rights, we have to read the annual report of the European Parliament, which proposes not to ""capture children as""Permitted age limit for homosexual relationships. ""We should fight against pornography, against the ever -spreading pedophilia, against trafficking in human beings, and against sex tourism, for it is always practiced to the detriment of minors. We should fight discrimination and violence, including mental violence, against working life, in the field of information, politics and family;The family returns to the center of the conversation as children are becoming a tool that meets their egoism that all other values, after losing their ""technological"" motherhood or paternity, endeavors to satisfy their own ego and desire for ownersEmergency cry: ""The road you choose will destroy the European Union and to be opened by the normal thinking of the overwhelming majority of its citizens."".(Fr) I want to explain the reasons for which I have voted for annual reports on human rights in the European Union. The two provisions of this text urging certain countries, including France, to rapidly ratify the European Framework Agreement on the protection of national minorities and the European Charter for Regional Languages ​​and Languages. Before all other things, I have to find out the misunderstanding that marks the whole debate on regional languages: it is by no means a matter of denying, teaching or promoting a minority language or a regional language, no matter what. If studying and practicing them is a personal choice, for my part, I support all of these languages ​​that are part of the measures to promote the cultural heritage, preservation and mediation of peoples. I was opposed to this report because the Haarder's report aims to promote the concept of European construction based on the community -based construction of the European Framework Convention on the Protection of National Minorities and the European Charter of Languages ​​or the European Charter. According to this concept, the individual has special rights because he or she belongs to a specific regional, ethnic or religious entity, with the community being an inevitable broker between the individual and the right he or she is required. Although the Community recognition may at first look like a protective factor that protects the integration of minorities, it is, on the contrary, a powerful factor that enhances breed separation and social recession (only think about the situation of young Turks and North African girls, which are excluded from the impact of education and well -being). Similarly, although the recognition of the special status of minorities seems to protect the most weakest and poor, on the contrary, it means the social compartmentalization used by the liberal liberalism. In addition, although it is true that we have to take into account the fate of certain national minorities due to the expansion of the European Union, but a communal solution does not represent the future for threatened or oppressed nations. On the contrary, the recent past has shown how the intensity of communal feeling can act as an acidity of ethnic disputes that have lasted thousands of years, which may lead to the Civil War. I prefer this concept of a universal view of a republican Europe, where each individual itself is a completely active legal entity with rights and freedoms."	fi
But to enlighten those who are going to make decisions, let's be honest, without hysteria so that the European Union can fund pretexts for destroying our fishing boats. Because, if we have to keep the flocks of Pisces, we must also maintain ports and fishermen. The Brussels Europe, instead of always being a United States, as it was in Seattle, Kosovo, Iraq, could support, in addition to international fishing organizations in the North Atlantic, in the Pacific, beyond the Tonoidal regulation, or by the Pacific Regulation,Fisheries between Peruvians, Japanese, Canadians, Russians, Europeans, a kind of Montego Bay for fishing resources between, and so we could scientifically manage the fishing resources, which are a common heritage of mankind. It would be a good globalization as opposed to a poor globalization, such as the one applied to the Free Trade Zones and other supposed OECD friends. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, if the European Commission wishes to carry out a reliable fishing policy, it must have as reliable and complete data on fishing stocks and fishing fleet. For the gathering of such elements, the Commission depends on the Member States. A Community framework for collecting these data can put order in these efforts and increase their scientific evaluation potential. The question, however, is whether the Member States are able to put the Commission to be subject to the new status. After all, can we have full confidence in this information? How reliable the data on the volume of catch can be, at the time of the market, more and more illegal quantities are available on the market, as recently admitted by David Cox of the British Fisheries Union in Fishing News. And what about the data on the fleet potential? Following the reviews of the Court of Auditors, the parliament accepted my amendment to the Cunha report in January with a large majority. This amendment requests an independent verification of the fleet's potential data. I would very much like the Commission to tell me what he did with this recommendation, which the Advisory Committee is supported. Finally, important decisions are once based on biologists' opinions. It therefore needs to increase the accuracy of biological predictions. I am referring to the certification for the preparation of opinions. Furthermore, the Commission must ensure adequate resources for the investigation of fishing stocks. It would also be useful to utilize the knowledge and experience of fishermen in the preparation of biological opinions.) Northern Ireland's fishing industry has suffered a lot of serious blows from this European Union. The waters where the fishermen fish are fishing are looted by others, and were forced to tie their own fishing boats and to abstain from fishing activities. Recent decisions on the quota of the Ireland's sea are another serious blow that may well be a deadly for the Northern Ireland fishing industry.	el
It is about aligning the examination regulations, but actually also about minimum standards.In a sense, I regret this. Of course, traffic safety is very important on road, rail or inland waterways, and in view of the international character of this transport, it is necessary to harmonize the training courses for security consultants and the requirements, for example in the upcoming new ADR.I think that is important as the implementation.Of course there are good reasons why we have to pay special attention to this problem.Think of the accidents that have occurred in road traffic in recent years.In Belgium, the Netherlands and other countries, dangerous goods transporters continued to drive on the side of the road despite the fog and, as it would have been necessary in view of the circumstances.Or think of shipers of Eastern European ships that anchor and from which are obviously dangerous.In addition, controls in Belgian, Finnish as well as in Japanese ports show that 50 % of the containers with sometimes dangerous load are not delivered properly.In short, a serious problem.As for the security advisors, such a consultant has been prescribed in the company in some countries since January 1 of this year.The implementation is currently associated with difficulties, especially in small companies, because they cannot afford such a place.Either you sell your cargo or mix with a different load, which leads to a number of problems.The recording of these activities in the form of annual reports or operating analyzes and possibly the inclusion in the certification according to ISO 9002 is also required. The actual work is done, now it is about implementation.Allow me a last hint.With regard to this implementation, we also have to make appropriate agreements with the Eastern European countries, since they will only join the corresponding agreement from July 1, 2001, i.e. in a year and a half.This gives them temporary competitive advantages.Although I do not find this bad, in particular, we should give priority to the safety aspects of the dangerous goods transport on the street, rail and inland waterways, pick up this part of the acquis as soon as possible and present the states willing to join.President, the Parliament rightly deals with traffic safety.The constantly increasing amount of goods promoted by Europe is open or hidden a danger to personnel and society. People who are faced with this danger must therefore meet high requirements.With the standards anchored in a different guideline, 95/35/EC, people should be able to advise against the transportation of dangerous goods.To my delight, the Council also consists of minimum requirements for their examination, although I would have preferred uniform binding standards and regulations with the aim of the aim of internationally equivalent.However, this does not seem to be feasible.Summa Summarum I think the amendment submitted by the rapporteur in every respect and can therefore fully support it.President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues!First I would like to congratulate the colleague Koch on his reports, which may be technical reports, but are very important for the security.	de
We have not heard anything from Mr Solana about some diplomatic intervention, which he or the European Union is serious - we are talking about serious diplomatic interventions - in order to stop the slaughter in Chechnya. We present large deviations from what we support human rights in principle. We have gathered forces to intervene in relation to Kosovo, and now we have caused chaos there, failing to send sufficient resources, staff and people on the spot to face a given situation, demonstrating our inability to deal seriously. Therefore, I would like to ask Mr Solana to explain to this body the position of the European Union on Chechnya. What are we going to do seriously to cease this heinous situation? We have means that we can use in relation to Russia if we choose to use them, but we choose to leave them untouched. Mr President, High Representatives and Mr. Commissioner, I have two questions for you, Mr Solana: How will you be able to continue to develop closer defensive and military cooperation, if Member States are not prepared to meet their joint commitments? With all due respect for the body, what counts is the result. I also wonder how you intend to persuade governments to ensure the actual establishment of the power of sixty thousand men so that there is not just one paper exercise left. If we look around, we will see that this is the reality and that the KEPPA is in danger of being left alone in words. Take, for example, the cuts of German defense spending - which are not only concerned for Defense Minister Scharping, but also concern the whole of Europe. In my country, Sweden, the 2,500 men involved in EU actions are a target and solidarity commitment. Under the present circumstances, the Armed Forces can only provide almost 1,500 men due to the reduction of credit. If we extend this example to other EU countries, which is not unreasonable unless the issue is re-examined, we do not reach 60,000 men, but at best we will have 35-40,000 in 2003. My second question is as follows: a few weeks ago the German media have apparently transmitted. However, I would like to know the details of this fact, that is, if you, as a High Representative, have considered the possibility of a special treatment of Austria in the context of your duties and, if so, at the command of what and with what field of action? This was a very long -term questions. I tend to believe that maybe Mr Van der Bos is right that I will need Angel to answer so many questions in such a short time, but I will try. I will try to do so and answer one by one all the questions you asked me, even if the MP who asked the question is no longer here, either because he was tired of the long meeting or because he had more important things to do than to hear.	el
I really believe, and with this I conclude, that social Europe cannot suffice in reasons and pious wishes. The situation is extremely serious for millions of people. Mr President, Mrs Commissioner, Honorable colleagues, the goal of drawing up a coordinated strategy to modernize social protection in the European Union is certainly something positive, as was the launch of the Luxembourg Summit, European Strategy and European Strategy. The labor market and social protection are indeed two aspects of the same coin, which require compulsory synchronized policies and laws. If the labor market works in terms of employment levels, flexibility and wage effectiveness, the welfare state and social protection, and vice versa. Until yesterday, European countries set the rules of operation and funding of the two markets in their own way. Financial and foreign exchange policies have taken care of internal and external balance. With Maastricht and the single currency, budgetary policies have been significantly reduced and it is no longer possible to appeal to depreciation, to seek outstanding competitiveness. Structural and contemporary differences between countries will therefore cannot be balanced through deficit and foreign exchange. Under these circumstances, in the absence of complete mobility of labor within the Union and distributed tax policy at the federal level, the only degree of flexibility is left to labor and welfare markets to restore both structural and co -existing inequalities. And here is the paradox. The convergence of politics and monetary Europe inevitably brings with it the convergence of the rules of the game in the labor market and welfare, but at the same time the single currency and lack of labor mobility, as well as a distributed tax policy, necessarily lead us to non -conveninglevel. These contradictions are not fought with hypocrisy and fine words such as convergence, reference points, modernization, coordination. Or the European Union will become a real federal state with a real distributed budget, actual mobility of labor, and therefore, only in this area, common rules for market and welfare, or it would be better not to create or nourish illusions for impossible paths that sound, but in fact. It would be good to all realize this. Mr President, in contrast to the attitude of some of my colleagues in today's debate, I tend to agree with the Andersson report, among other things because I see clear differences in relation to the Commission's announcements. In particular, I believe that this report - and referring to it, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur - defends the solidarity approach of the European social model. I would like to emphasize the clear positions against social dumping as well as the emphasis on basic social security, the goal of social convergence and to what is very specific about the equality of women's opportunities as guidelines of social policy.	el
"During the past year, the Member States of the Union thus naturally decided to implement the concrete measures intended to strengthen the capacity of action of their armed forces, and the informal summit of Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main orientations.On this subject, I would have two questions to which your knowledge of files and actors must make it possible to provide enlightening answers for the continuation of our debates and our work.The first question concerns the formation of this rapid intervention force of sixty thousand men, likely, you said, to be implemented for the execution of peacekeeping and strengthening missions, and capable of maintaining them permanently if necessary.For the intelligence of our colleagues, I must indicate here that the corresponding contingents must then be shared by third parties: a third party to prepare the mission, a third party to execute it and a third party to recover, after tests often difficult for staff and equipment.This explains that the first figures indicated in the press, fixing at around 200,000 men the volume of the forces to be constituted, that is to be close to reality, which did not fail to surprise the uninitiated.My first question will be simple and more direct, perhaps, Mr. High Representative, than that of colleagues who preceded me.You know the French proverb ""no money, no Swiss"".Do you really think that union governments are ready to pay the corresponding price when many of them remain at least decided to continue to collect what was called ten years ago ""peace dividends"".My second question will be more technical, but it is important for a most harmonious transfer to the European Union, the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Union of Western Europe.You have indicated, in this area, the establishment of three committees, a political and security committee which started today, the military committee.Then, you mentioned its relations with third countries members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of Western Europe, but which are not members of the European Union.In the functioning of interim institutions whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr. High Representative, what status do you imagine to confer on the members of the Alliance and the States associated with the UEO, I repeat, which are not yet members of the European Union?Could they, for example, have a place, at least observers, within the various political and security committees or the military committee?You know they are concerned about this risk of being isolated and I mean that I understand their desire to participate with you in the completion of this construction.Mr. Chairman, Mr. Secretary General of the Council, as you will understand, we have followed with great interest in this assembly the information that you transmitted to us on the result of the informal meeting of the Defense Ministers which took place in Sintra and its importance in the process of European integration in terms of security and defense."	fr
"In a world village the big differences in the world will no longer be tolerated by the poorest part of the village. At some point there will be an uprising and will be justified. So I would like to invite the Council's presidency to begin the announcement of the announcement as soon as possible, and especially to complete it, so that we all understand, especially EU citizens, what are the impact of globalization and therefore to realize that there is a key element. In terms of growth and its level, we are much lower than the promising 0.7% of the EU on average. Most likely others are worse than us, but that doesn't help us at all. Above all, however, we must give countries the opportunity to negotiate with us. From what I heard - but maybe I did something - the word trade did not mention the speech of the Council's chairman at all. To the Commissioner I just want to say that I hope he will succeed in passing his proposal to the Commission and the Member States. I would also like to ask the Commissioner to give us some specific examples of interests of various sectors that pursue a derogatory policy not only to the Commission but also to the Member States. Also, I would like to say that I believe that the most effective policy would be for parliament to demand a recommendation from the Development Council and the Commissioner responsible for the development respectively, so that we may have a basis on which we can discuss instead of demanding suggestions from all governments and from all of the Commission. I will close in a nutshell for the internet revolution. As Commissioner Liikanen says and says to all, in Europe, we have a lead in the field of mobile telephony. Let us use it not only for the benefit of our own peoples but also for the benefit of developing countries. This technique will make it possible for the necessary quantum jump, and in this regard the EU could regulate the agenda, give weight to growth and stand up to its worldwide responsibilities. Mr President, ""The situation is hopeless in terms of the development cooperation of the European Union"". I quote a newspaper title, which appeared last week about Union development policy. This is not a new finding. Whenever we try to do something in Europe for development cooperation, its effectiveness and quality are challenged. There is a risk that any hope of improvement will disappear as long as the Commission continues to refuse to look at the mirror. Why isn't the public report on the inconsistency of development policy? An important conclusion of this report concerns the internal contradiction of European policy. Specifically in the areas of trade and agriculture, European policy contradicts development policy. We fail to have a serious contribution to the development of less developed countries."	el
"To the extent that the product that is abusively called chocolate will not even be cheaper, the consumer does not earn from the purchasing price what it loses in terms of transparency in relation to the nature of the product. Since we also do not share the protective concerns behind the defense of ""genuine chocolate"", we see no reason why we vote in favor of the Brussels directive..(FR) After two years of postponement, the Council approved, in October 1999, a joint position on the cocoa and chocolate products directive. This text, as it is, does not allow the protection of consumer interests, craftsmen who make chocolate products and cocoa producers, nor guaranteeing the quality of chocolate. In fact, it establishes the use of vegetable fats other than the cocoa butter, does not provide for strict consumer information and does not particularly refer to the lack of reliable method of analyzing and measuring the chocolate fats. In this way, this proposal does not respond by any concerns expressed by MEPs during the first reading on October 23, 1998. This text opens the gates for industrial production substitutes of the cocoa butter from the cocoa but by the cocoa. Its approval may cause a dramatic reduction in income, both for the eleven millions of people living from cocoa, western Africa and all of cocoa -producing areas. To make us better swallow this bitter medicine, we were forced to give the text a social taste with the pretext that it allows the interests of the poorest countries producing Kariti butter, such as Mali or Burkina Faso. In any case, there is no guarantee on the part of the chocolate industry that they will use the Kariti coconut butter, which cannot, however, replace cocoa butter to more than 50%. In this case, this is a largely artificial conflict between cocoa producers and Kariti producers, between the poor and the poorer countries. In fact, this Directive proposal mainly expresses the position of its multinationals of chocolate and ultimately defends only their own interests. Therefore, it could not satisfy me. For this reason, I fully support the amendments that share the concerns of craftsmen making chocolate products, consumer interests and the future of millions of peasants who produce cocoa..(FR) I would like to congratulate the rapporteur from the outset on the persistence he has shown on the ""chocolate"" case. I will briefly remind the key pillars of this case. In 1996, the European Commission suggested that we amend the 1973 directive that allowed the United Kingdom, Ireland and Denmark to deviate from the current rule, replacing a part of butter cocoa with other vegetable fats to a maximum of 5%. In fact, with the integration of new Member States, the number of countries that have approved the use of other vegetable fats outside the cocoa butter is seven together with Finland (which allows 10%content), Austria, Portugal and Sweden. The other eight countries prohibit it (Germany, Belgium, Spain, France, Greece, Italy, Luxembourg, Netherlands)."	el
"We work so effectively and competently "". So, dear Member States, we believe that it is time that the common foreign and security policy between the conclusions of the council, between meter-long communiqués and what we can really do in this field can build a bridge.Thank you very much for the fact that you also have a little more interesting for us in the decision -making process for this.Participation in this debate and your interesting explanations on the topic.I would also like to thank the woman for her presence and for the words she addressed to us.In general, the various factions about the easily determined fact of the underrepresentation of women in the decision -making processes, both in the political and in the economic and social sector.Nobody today denies that women have to participate in political life, in the parties and institutions, but it is not easy for us to achieve agreement on the form in which this participation is to be achieved.Equality between men and women who affect the lives of women and thus society in general means equality in work, both when accessing the employment - which requires equality in training - as well as in the remuneration for the same work, which has been challenged so often and is so far away from reality.We are convinced that the participation of women at the decision -making process for society will be useful as a whole.The woman always brings a different view than the men who contribute to the enrichment and perfection of the overall vision with regard to the best solutions to the problems of daily life, to whose solution to the solution that, like us, are committed.But the difficulty is to find the right solution that allows women to be present in the responsible positions and thus in the decision -making processes.In some countries of the European Union, an mandatory quota regulation has been decided by law, which immediately achieved a more balanced presence of women.However, this should not be the best solution, because there is not always a sufficient number of women who are willing to join a problematic world that is essentially considered masculine because they were traditionally reserved for men.The proportion of women in the political parties does not reach 50 %, not even in the world of work and in the social field.It is much lower, and it is precisely this participation of the base that should promote the presence of women.In addition, there must be a clear and real will so that there are more women who are able and willing to take responsibility and duties in political life, that is, to take over in the decision -making process."	de
High representative Solana's words ensure that we also have a leading position in the militarized European Union. In addition, this is probably the reason why a high representative of the NATO, the Secretary General of NATO, who is also guilty of a crime against Yugoslavia, a suitable place who is in danger of being convicted of a war crime, was appointed to this position. Mr A Commission Member, a Mr A high representative, is undoubtedly true that you have taken some questions promptly, persistently and to a great extent. I have been considering the positive interpretations that some of the organizations representing the press and some colleagues have made from the direction we are going today and I do not quite agree with them. I believe that, unlike a large -scale financial and monetary union - which was incorporated as part of the community structures - unfortunately, common foreign and security policy today is part of inter -government cooperation alone. Mr. High Representative, Dear Member of the Commission, my first question is whether you have, together with others, have developed strategies in order to even gradually create a process where a common foreign and security policy can be developed within the community. It took us 15 years to create a financial and monetary union. It can also take 15 years to develop defense and security policy and foreign policy, but the process must be consistent. In addition, I believe that we do not need to downplay the influence and contribution of lobbying groups formed by the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, and this is related to my other question. Foreign Ministries have made a significant contribution to the 40 -year -old construction of the community, as we know. Now, however, they all have to lose if foreign policy was communal, and I think they are working in this direction. Finally, I would talk about Kosovo's question. Member Cohn-Binds did the right thing when he emphasized this issue, because I think we must get my European Union urgently to consider the final position of Kosovo. If Kosovo is not awarded any position, it will be subjected to the mercy of Belgrade's volatility, murders dictated from Belgrade, and provocation, so the European Union must urgently express its position on the matter. In the end, I would like to thank the member Poettering, for the initiatives of Belgian - to which they are called vaguely - I think they begin to bring results. I also think that there are other 14 Member States who have several grounds not to attend, for example, the European Union meetings, for example. Although it has been four years since the arrest of Dutroux and partners, the trial has still not been organized, and we still do not know about today's events. There will certainly be those in those 15 Member States who are wondering if it makes sense to curb joint holidays between parents and children, for example in Belgium. So it is time for a high representative of Solan and Commission member Patten to say - what I call them - to Michel Barnier, a member of the Commission, that he exaggerates and that his thoughts may eventually turn against himself, which I really hope. Mr President, at first I would like to thank the heart of the heart of March 1, which has introduced certain structures related to Europe's security and defense policy. However, I wonder how he himself is. The documents talk about good cooperation with a high representative. You just said that you had discussed new structures at lunch, and it would still be missing that you would not have discussed them and that there would be no good cooperation between you and the new structures. However, do you not suffer from the fact that you do not lead it yourself, but actually you form the core of it? I would, as I believe, many others in this Parliament that you would act as a power that moves on this issue and that there would be no risk that you would be left out in some way.	fi
"President, it cannot go on, something has to be done against these conditions.President!Amsterdam's contract has marked an important goal of the Union, a task that all parliamentarians, the council and the Commission have to take on during this parliamentary term: As already said, creating a space of freedom, security and right.The Council of Tampere, motor and author of this goal has proposed a few target points, but five years as a period of time intended for the realization of the title IV of the contract is too long to wait for the solution that urgently require some problems.My first consideration is that the parliament is not on the side of the important resolutions that are made in this area and that its participation in the process of decision -making must be guaranteed, especially if it is about a project of the citizens, as the Commissioner correctly said.My second consideration is that progress in the adoption of a common asylum system must quickly be made, with which joint procedural standards are accepted and, above all, the currently prevailing confusion between immigration is put to an end for political and economic reasons.The immigration laws that have recently been adopted in my country, Spain, or in Belgium warn us to tackle the communication of immigration policy urgently.My third and last reflection is related to the Union's foreign policy in the area of ​​immigration and asylum.We are allowed to and we cannot give the impression that the Union strives to defend itself against an avalanche of refugees and economic immigrants.We have to stand up for a policy of development cooperation with our eastern and Mediterranean neighboring countries, but we have to do it conscientiously, with economic means and in close cooperation with the public institutions that work together in the protection of citizens who want to see or emigrate their most fundamental rights because it is about their most elementary needs.After all, as far as the Charter of Fundamental Rights is concerned, it is necessary that European citizens identify their citizenship.It is not enough to have the euro or employment, not even security is everything.You need the ""European soul"", as a well -known Spanish professor said.President, in contrast to some previous speakers, I would like to come back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and the statements by Mr. Vitorino.As Mr. Ceyhun said, the explanations of this gentlemen were music in our ears.As in music, fine -tuning and coordination are also necessary here.Many of us look very optimistic about the six months ahead of us.The citizens of Europe will listen to our melody and they will want to hear the right melody.As mentioned this afternoon, it will take a while before we can remove the missions that we have heard during the European elections and over the past few months.The project of Amsterdam and the council meeting of Tampere continued the project to create a space of freedom, security and law in the European Union.However, one area is of enormous importance, and Parliament must be included in this area: control."	de
That is, it is possible for the Commission to submit new initiatives so that we can see a cliff like a drop of water, can we, through the Commission and the constant effort of Parliament, to convince the Council that one has to start in this field? Mr President, a Member of the Commission, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur, Viceconte, a member of the Parliament, who spoke extensively about the concrete opportunities offered to the 15 states of the Union by increasing jobs in this field by presenting wise European Union initiatives in this field. Just this afternoon, we suddenly discussed the problem of workers who have become unemployed, and now we have hopes to find solutions to these problems. Tourism is a sector that, due to its nature and nature, is covered by the competence of the European Union. All European states all over the world are known as jealous tourist destinations for everyone, even the United States, and we spoke of the United States this afternoon in the conversation of Indians. I would like to emphasize a single thing in the Viceconte report that I especially appreciate and agree, and which I would like the Parliament and the Commission to consider and then express a positive view of it. This is related to retirement travel. Usually I see a Commission member DiamantoPoulou to tear their hair as unhappy because the elderly live too long, causing problems to pay for pensions. In this case, however, the fact that we live longer leads to a larger number of elderly people. Many of them, though unfortunately not all, circulate the world to see the miracles of the world and to learn, to know new things: Italians travel to see how they live in England, to see the Greeks to live in Turkey, to greet their Italian cousins. Tourism approximates the peoples of 15 Member States, as well as all the peoples of the world and will certainly increase peace and mutual understanding. This large -scale tourism, in particular by the elderly, is equally significant. This kind of tourism must be favored, it must be promoted as it allows you to work in tourism -focused areas, not only in the summer, when you go to the sea shore, for example, but also in winter, when it is good to breathe clean air. The elderly are always on vacation, from 1 January 1 to the year until December 31, because they do not work, they do not have only one annual holiday month. Unfortunately, not everyone, but for this reason I ask the Commission to take action in accordance with the proposal of the Viceconte report. Mr President, I would like to first thank the rapporteur Viceconte and congratulate him for his report. I believe that we all recognize the economic, social and environmental importance of tourism in current advanced Europe and good growth and employment potential for tourism. I think it is a pleasure to see that the Commission and Parliament are aiming for the same goal in this area. Employment aspects are currently attractive in tourism. An essential prerequisite for moving forward in this area is as fruitful as possible with the Member States, the tourism and other partners. It determines the results of our work. Of course, the Commission aims to coordinate with national employment policies. It is also important for the Special Peak Meeting in March, where tourism is certainly highlighted as a significant employment industry. Member States and the tourism themselves must be closely involved in coordinating the community's tourism activities with other important areas, such as regional, transport, employment, environmental, cultural and competition policy. Of the specialist policies, I would only highlight one that focuses on regional policy. The Commission document for the new Structural Fund's programming period already mentions tourism as one of the fields that have good employment opportunities thanks to competitive companies. The Commission hopes that Member States will emphasize more and more travel in their plans and programs. Quality, sustainability and innovation are keywords in the Commission's own policy and priorities recognized by the Council of Ministers. High -quality products are needed to improve competitiveness, sustainability to protect resources and innovation, especially to utilize information technology.	fi
In theory, a common fishing policy is very demanding and very disciplined, perhaps much more disciplined than many Europeans and many non -European believers. As a result, I have requested a publication of the European Commission to map all the actions aimed at the storage and protection of fishing resources covered by a common fishing policy and could be used to disseminate information on our protection measures. We have also asked the Parliament's Main Union 4 to prepare a systematic report for us members of the Fisheries Committee on these activities. Reviewing a common fisheries policy in 2002 is currently our most important goal, the purpose of which is to thoroughly review, renew or update a common fishing policy as a whole. I emphasize the holisticness of the reform and, consequently, that common fishing policy must take into account the protection of fish resources. This is what I have requested from the European Commission and the units of our parliament. In my opinion, the current state of fish resources and gross fish back into the sea do not indicate the functionality of this system, which I think has to be significantly improved. Dear President, I can't and I don't want to talk too long, we all know that there is not much time and that interpreters have their own schedules. Therefore, I remind you that Bergen is a really good example of how real marine policy needs to be created. As the chairman of the Council stated in our committee, when stating that the current Presidium Portuguese aims to seek to maintain fishing policy at a sustainable level, this must be our goal in Europe and worldwide. In this regard, Bergen took important community initiatives that our committee has always supported to renew spawning position, reduce fishing efforts and adapt them to fish resources, protect young fish, species and habitats, and introduce selection and responsible fishing techniques. These aspects, as well as effective control systems, are very important for the future of fishing. However, it is not advisable to go to extremes, as Katiforis had originally suggested in its draft report. I'm talking about this now, because later I no longer have time to make a speech. So I would like to say that due to several reviews and the flexibility shown by Katifiis in our committee, we were able to accept his report in our committee. Coincidence and fate contributing to this same session deals with the report on fishing and environmental issues in my and Katifiisis, while also discussing the oral question asked by our committee tomorrow, the very serious consequences of the Erika accident to the fishing industry. Maritime, as well as the pollution and waste produced by industry and cities, affect the fishing sector in a negative way. Problems in the industry are not only due to overfishing. Much thanks, Mr Fischler, a member of the Commission. The discussion has ended. The vote will be made tomorrow at 11am. The management of fish resources and the marine environment on the agenda is the following is the report by the Katphoris Fisheries Committee (A5-0017/2000) about the Commission Commission to the Council and the European Parliament: Fisheries Care and Marine Environment Nature Conservation (Kom (1999) 363 - C5-0176/1999 - 1999/2155). Many times before, Parliament has dealt with problems with the management of fisheries and environmental protection. This special Commission Communication is part of the Commission's overall strategy, which aims to include environmental aspects into community policies. The overall strategy of the Commission is to direct fishing in a more economically and environmentally sustainable direction, in order to prevent scarce fish resources in order to prevent the funding of overfishing and/or environmental pollution. Another option for successful care is the financial shutdown of the fishing industry, as fish stocks are dwindling, and more and more, imports are responding to the demand for fish products. I understand that I have been described in Spanish newspapers as an enemy of fisheries because I have said that. Of course, I am the enemy of the fisheries in the sense that my recommendation is that the branch should not be cut across to sit.	fi
Then oil comes to the beaches, and then the politicians appear, the ministers and strive for disposal with a small bucket, but if a tough guideline is up for debate 14 days later, you have forgotten the good words from yesterday.We will not be able to rule out 100 % accidents, but we can make the provision as optimally as possible.This consistent guideline is an important step.I also hope that the liberal colleagues may consider it until tomorrow whether they cannot - for reasons of parliamentary identity - as in the first reading in the second reading, because we will then go to the mediation process anyway, and you have to see how far the advice can move.I believe that for environmental and competitive reasons as well as what was decided two months ago, in January, we should say goodbye tomorrow with a large majority, as we have debated them in the committee.President, Ms. Commissioner!Mr. rapporteur, my congratulations on your report.You have just said it: This guideline is urgently needed.It is a reasonable guideline.The ports need collecting facilities.Checks are finally carried out.Member States must also impose sanctions if the regulations are not complied with.This is extremely important and serves environmental protection.Investments are already being made in anticipation of the guideline.In Antwerp, for example, a large system is currently being built near my residential area, which has so far been missing.In a sense, the present directive is already effective.In a point that Mr. Jarzembowski also addressed, we disagree.How do you load the disposal costs to the ship?We agree on the principle, namely the cause of the polluter pays.Should the pollution automatically pay the port fees in full or make a significant contribution, or do we choose a flexible regulation, as proposed by the Council now,?Which solution offers the most effective economic incentive, as you said?I spoke to several people about that.The viewpoints differ, and obviously it is also very different in practice.Even between the ports and the same region, there are differences and apply different percentages.Some ports literally change their percentage at the last moment.We as a parliament should therefore not commit ourselves to a certain percentage.A flexible system, as you said, must include a significant contribution to the costs.0.01 % are really not a major contribution.Due to a flexible part that is kept open, those who behave environmentally friendly must be offered incentives.The prerequisite is that the commission carefully monitors and checked the whole thing whether the system works.If the goals of the guideline are not achieved, you should intervene at the Commission, take steps, suggest changes and make sure that the system actually applies.We definitely have to save this guideline, maintain and get it.Hopefully we will not endanger them by taking too fundamental attitude in a single point.President!It was not yet possible to believe that waste was completely disposed of when folding on the high seas when folded.	de
Especially in the past few months it has been talked about which position the development council can take in the field of Union policy.As is known, there is a clear difference between development policy and other political fields at the Union level - just think of the difficult conditions under which the EFE's recording or non -recording in the budget - and it is difficult to assume that we can achieve a greater coherence of the European Union's policies without a more active and stronger role in the advisory board for political decisionsArea of ​​development and which are felled in other councils, in other decision -making centers - whether in the councils for agriculture and fishing or in those for the environment - in which the development council has so far had no way of being heard or intervening.As a result, it will certainly be difficult without a more active role in the overall coordination of the political decisions, which are directly affected by the development policy of the European Union and are on the sidelines of its decision -making center, to realize a more coherent policy of the European Union in the field of development goals.Here, too, the word and considerations of the European Parliament will be relevant and welcome.At the beginning I would like to go into the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the EU and the AKP countries.Participation in these negotiations was an extremely positive experience.I saw how the Member States worked together as a team, and that was very gratifying.In the end, both sides were very satisfied, not only because the negotiations were completed, but because we were all aware that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 AKP countries.The world needs such experiences, and this is a very positive signal with regard to the discussion about the question of globalization.I would like to explain some of the most important innovations in the new agreement.Corruption is openly addressed, and for the first time we create a framework in which the problem of immigration can be treated.We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society among reforms and politics that are to be funded by the EU.At the center of development policy, we are increasingly putting poverty control.The basis for assigning funds is not only the evaluation of the needs of a country, but also its politics.To promote the development of the private sector, we set up an investment facility.We rationalize the instruments and introduce a new system of dynamic program planning so that the community and the recipient countries can regularly attach corrections to the cooperation programs.We settle the administrative and, in some cases, the financial responsibilities at the local level are decentralized in order to enable more effective cooperation.We improve the political framework for commercial and investment development.We expand cooperation in all areas that are important for trade, including new areas such as work standards and the connection between the environment and trade.I am sure that against the background of the events in Seattle you will welcome the importance of these agreements.Let me go into some of the most important points.First, the agreement on political questions.	de
This is the meaning of an amendment that we have deposited, which favors all the languages ​​of the community and which will condition our agreement on the second directive.It is quite different from the first proposal.The original text could have received our assent insofar as it proceeded from a legitimate concern which was to update the existing legislation.The text text - and I salute the work of our colleague Schmidt - however, cannot have our agreement for several reasons.First, it favors far too much from indices that have no more relationship with the real economy, derivative products that will help increase the financial bubble of which our colleague Lipietz spoke at the moment.Second, like him, I think we don't have to promote excessive concentration in funds that would ultimately prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.So, of course, no reciprocity is planned for European UCITS.We will also oppose the ability of the faculty left to the States to bring to 35 % ... (the president withdraws the floor to the speaker) Mr. President, this is a vital question for Europe.A Europe that lives with a time bomb ready to explode from an instant to the other, I have appointed pensions, must take all measures to encourage savings and maximize the yields that European citizens can obtain from their savings.I welcome Mr. Schmidt's report, which brings many interesting developments.UCITS are a success in the European Union.These are safe products marketed at the cross -border level.But it is time to update the legislation.Mr. Schmidt did an excellent job in this direction.I will not surprise anyone saying that I would have preferred by far that Mr. Schmidt's report has not undergone as many modifications during his visit to Parliament.But I urgently ask this assembly to adopt a balanced and good approach to this question.The radical advance of this report is to allow UCITS to invest in over -the -counter derivatives.I challenge anyone here to assess the products that will be used by UCITS.We are not talking about speculation, but of the means of reducing risks and increasing the yields of investments made by the ordinary European citizen.Mr. Schmidt deserves applause for having received the support of the Parliament in the issue of over -the -counter derivatives.We must not fear going from before, to react to changes in the market.Yes, we must continue to ensure that UCITS remain a balanced and safe product for consumers.The report protects consumers in a completely adequate way.But a series of amendments go too far in the restriction of the use of over -the -counter derivatives.I have the feeling that they will be an interesting complement to Sicav's wallets, and that they can only help everyone, everywhere in Europe, to obtain a high return from their savings.I salute Mr. Schmidt.Thank you Mr. Kuckelkorn.Dear colleagues, I want to give you the information I have just received about the curtain and the window.	fr
"Both countries are also entitled to financial aid from the Meda program (B7-4012).In the first and second reading on the budget 2000, the European Parliament emphasized that the new title ""Strategy to prepare the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe"" (B7-0), which was proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft of the budget plan, should not only refer to the associated states of Middle and Eastern European, but also extended to other third countries such as Malta and Cyprus.However, since the council refused to negotiate the necessary revision of the upper limit in section 7 (introductory) of the financial foresight, the parliament exceptionally accepted this - I expressly accept this - the financing of these expenses under rubric 4 (external policy areas) of the financial foresight in 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament ""Cooperation with the third -party countries""(B7-04).Within this chapter, two new articles were created for the approach strategy for Malta and Cyprus and given a ""P.M."" note until the Commission - in the implementation of the resolutions of Helsinki - presented the necessary legal bases and the revision of the upper limit of section 7 of the financial foresight has taken place.This proposal for a regulation should be one of these legal bases!- (en) I welcome Mr. Brok's report, in which the commission's proposals to prepare Cyprus and Malta are supported for EU membership with amendments.As part of this package, the two countries will be granted a total of around 15 million euros in the current year.However, it is regrettable that the Commission deals with several years of financing and instead decided to provide funds on an annual basis.This must inevitably affect Malta and Cyprus planning.Technical and financial support is given with the central equipment so that the two islands can take the necessary takeover of the ""Aquis"" of the community.In view of the status of these two countries, which has already been advanced compared to other candidates, it should not be difficult for them to be equipped for membership at the end of the five -year program ""technically and administratively"".Report Cederschiöld (A5-0020/2000) as a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Currency During the previous election period, I welcome the assumption of the present framework decision to increase the protection of our uniform currency.The Union must use all the funds available to it in order to be able to ensure efficient protection of the euro from fake.Consumers, the business people are not really familiar with the euro yet.Correct money can therefore be relatively easy to circulate in supermarkets, in exchange offices and in banks without this being noticed immediately.The fact that the coins will have a national side also makes their identification more difficult.The Euro-Info centers, which already perform an extremely important function for the uniform currency, must lead an increased campaign to draw the public at the risk of falsification of money.At another level, the cooperation between communal and national institutions is to be guaranteed and an information system that serves to collect and exchange data regarding money counterfeits is to be created.Criminal measures must also be taken so that the protection of the euro is secured from the first minute.In this context, the European Parliament has submitted the draft framework decision to reinforce criminal protection against falsification of money."	de
For Germany this means that the initial 148000 hectoliters can be increased to 468000 hectatra. This is the total volume for which contracts were made with Germany. The amended Rules for Preventive Distillation will be published soon in the Official Journal of the European Communities and will have a retroactive effect from 24 February. Mr. Commissioner, there are some more thoughts on the committee, in view of the huge 140m -hector wine -maker and the wine market organization that will be valid in 2000 to exploit the compulsory distillation to relieve the market in the last year? Mr President, Mr Member, first, I believe that if we can accept all the applications submitted by the German side and almost all the applications of the other Member States without it, the balance of the wine market is largely restored. I believe that - especially if you keep in mind that we intend to significantly limit the compulsory distillation in the reform of wine market policy - we must not create the impression that we are now reversing once again. Question No.61 (H-0156/00): Subject: Railway Railway Reopening the Commission The Commission told the Spanish press (9 February 2000, EFE Agency) that it perceived the necessity of a railway line in the heart of the Pyrenees and the Government(mud valley) on the French side. The Commission also testified that if the states agreed with each other, it would strengthen the registration of this line on the trans -European network in the forthcoming revision of the objectives of this network. But is it not a committee's duty to invite the two interested states to implement the railway preference policy and persuade them to reach an agreement on the reopening of this line? What actions does the committee intend to take to accelerate this agreement? Es) With regard to your question in relation to the reopening of the Railway Railway, there is a need to examine ground or maritime alternatives that will help reduce traffic congestion at the two ends of the Pyrenees, east and west. Indeed, at these two ends of the Pyrenees we face a state of congestion, as they constitute the unique real terrestrial connections with some capacity between the Iberian peninsula and the rest of the European continent. From the committee side we have favored the analysis of a new railway line in the central part of the Pyrenees and supported various initiatives in the area through the grant of various studies to analyze the possibilities. Apart from them - as you know very well - Spain and France recommended an Observatory for Pyrenees in order to find a more appropriate solution to the problem they are facing. In any case, the final decision on the issue is up to the Member States. In trans -European networks we cannot include anything not supported by the Member States. In the meantime, I would like to tell you that the Commission will take into account the results of the work of the Pyrenees Observatory in the Pyrenees when it is time to revise the trans -European networks, a review we expect to be ready before August.	el
"There are postal businesses that hold a monopoly position and do their job pretty well. We need to protect these things and the others to complain. Mr President, Mr Commissioner, this morning I have heard on French state radio that the liberation of postal services is now practical a matter of hours or days and that it is irrevocable, such as in the case of our Swedish, Dutch and German friends. This is particularly concerned about us and is why we asked for this debate today. The Commission has, in fact, committed to the universal postal service and the European Parliament has repeatedly demonstrated that the postal service is indeed a fundamental factor of social and regional cohesion, as some colleagues have already pointed out. In this respect, I would probably like to address our Swedish colleague to ask him what he thinks about the study that was done, which shows that in the most secluded areas of Sweden, the postal service at distribution level is rather bad. Therefore, we do not want such a service. The financial benefit of the postal service was recognized in the Amsterdam Treaty, and we estimate that it goes far beyond distribution. It is the service that remains the most accessible to citizens and which we call ""public service"" is the one that allows all residents of European territory to be served and this acquis must remain a community acquis. The recognition by the European Union of a high quality postal service and for all is no longer the case today, which is increasingly concerned. For this reason, today, we demand that we not find ourselves on Monday before unpleasant surprises under the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee. Recall that Parliament's positions have been clearly determined and that the Greens team supported them. This resolution on January 14, 1999, requested the Commission, before any further liberation of this key sector, which concerns, however, 1.7 million employees, to conduct impact studies of this release. But we are not convinced that the studies we have today are enough to proceed with this liberation and we are worried about why we know very well that this release without an impact study would cause the abolition of thousands of jobs, which we do not want at all. We care about our Public Service, the Catholic Postal Service, because we know that citizens are interested in this service - and we are citizens' representatives and in this regard - and the Commission pledged, at the hearing of Mr Bolkestein, to maintain this universal service in the European Union. I will not repeat the various suggestions he has made during his hearing, I think we are all still remembering them. We insist on our position awaiting this actual evaluation before any final decision, as noted in both the Directive and the revision of the 1997 Directive. We will not accept any date of liberation of all postal activities, as long as the Commission does not guarantee that the Catholic Service will be integrated into this DirectiveCitizen."	el
"I, too, dare to mention the peat. The list of renewable energy sources does not mention peat. However, at least in Finland, it is an important, sustainable, slowly renewable source of energy. I hope it can be included in the list of renewable energy sources in the future. Mr. Member of the Commission, Good Colleagues, Verts/Ale Group, rejoices in agreement and thanks to anyone who has succeeded in negotiating a review that is almost in line with the Greens. As a new member of the Parliament, I find it interesting that hundreds of millions of euros every year for tobacco cultivation are reserved in the budget. It is a marginal economy that does not create jobs hardly and is not internationally competitive. I also know how many budgets in relation to tobacco cultivation will receive renewable energy sources, which are of ecological importance and are expected to significantly increase the economy. The fact that some small countries, such as Denmark, have been able to achieve a significant market share in that field, because they have joined the industry among the first, I think the reason for thinking and justification is that in the long run, we have to raise the budget for renewable energy sources. I would say a few more words about the program. In my opinion, it is very important that renewable energy sources are introduced in areas where they can be constantly developed and that they can promote economic growth and job creation. If we want 50 % or more of the ""mixed energy"" come from renewable energy sources, we cannot settle for any quick solutions that are only profitable in the short term. Mr President, I would like to start by congratulationing the rapporteur Langen for his work. The actions of the Altener program promotes renewable energy sources, and I think such programs deserve financial support during the development phase, as they have enormous commercial potential for the future. For this reason, I am particularly pleased that the budget is concentrated in projects for small and medium -sized enterprises. Internationally agreed emissions reduction goals cannot be achieved exclusively through these programs. In this respect, it should be remembered that energy policy is still covered by Member States. It is important that national governments provide full support for improving energy efficiency and developing renewable energy sources. I am pleased that Ireland recently announced that it would use £ 125 million to develop the environment for sustainable energy. I would like the Altener program to lead to new initiatives. As stated correctly in the final text, such actions may contribute to reduced regional differences. I can guarantee that interest in the Altener program is already significant in my constituency Leinster, a significant part of which is part of the Irish target 1 area. I am in favor of all efforts to remedy infrastructures such as energy, such as energy development. In short, we have a major challenge ahead of us, as we need to fulfill our commitments in accordance with the Kyoto minutes, which are about restricting the emissions of greenhouse gases in the energy industry, while contributing to the growth of our economies. The Altener program is a valuable addition to the common aspirations of Member States. Mr President, a good rapporteur, good colleagues, as our rapporteur reminded, are now with the Council at the end of the long and difficult mediation procedure for the Altener program. Our rapporteur reminded that the amount of the council proposed by the Council was originally 74 million francs, compared with 81.1 million, which corresponds to the amount supported by the European Parliament. The first mediation negotiations failed because the Council agreed to increase only EUR 1.9 million at that time. We cannot accept such a proposal that would be questionable to the European Parliament's powers. In the second phase of mediation, we managed to raise funding by EUR 1.1 million, so we reached the compromise of EUR 77 million. Although the funding was raised by EUR 3 million compared to the original proposal, I am once again sorry that the funding does not match the endeavors and that the desire to save the Council is in great contradiction with the declarations it has given energy, job creation and environmental protection."	fi
"We have to protect this kind of thing and denounce other practices.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, I heard this morning on French national waves, that the liberalization of La Poste would be practically only a matter of hours or days and that it was irremediable, like what happened to our Swedish, Dutch and German friends.This is very worried about and this is the reason why we asked for this debate today.The Commission has, in fact, engaged in a universal postal service, and the European Parliament has shown it several times, the postal service indeed constitutes, as certain colleagues have already said, an essential factor of social and territorial cohesion.In this regard, I would like to address our Swedish colleague in this regard to ask him what he thinks of the study that has been carried out and which shows that indeed, in more remote sectors of Sweden, postal service would be rather bad, in terms of distribution.So we don't want this postal service.The economic interest of the postal service has been recognized by the Amsterdam Treaty and we believe that it goes far beyond the distribution.It is the service that remains closest to citizens and that we call ""public service"", which allows each resident on European territory to be served and this achievement must remain a community acquired.The European Union recognition of a high quality postal service, and for everyone, remains of it today, and we are more and more concerned.This is why, today we are asking not to have unpleasant surprises on Monday in the regional policy, transport and tourism committee.We recall that the positions of the Parliament were clearly defined and that the group of Greens supported them.This resolution of January 14, 1999, asked that before any continuation of the liberalization of this key sector which still concerns 1.7 million employees, the Commission provides studies of the impact of this liberalization.However, we are not convinced that the available studies can today set up this liberalization, and we are worried because we know very well that this liberalization without impact study would lead to thousands of job cuts, which we absolutely do not want.We hold at our public service, to our universal service of postal services, because we know, and we are the representatives of citizens here too, that citizens are due to this service and the commission has committed, during the hearing of Mr. Bolkestein, to preserve this universal service in the European Union.I will not resume the different words he made during his hearing, I believe that we still have them in memory.We also maintain that we await this real evaluation before any final decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive. We will not accept a date of liberalization of all postal activities until the Commission has given us the guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the postal public service will be maintained in the states which consider this service essential."	fr
The parliament always saw an important potential provider of employment opportunities in the social economy.The amendments mentioned coincide with the view represented by the parliament that the social exclusion is a serious problem that requires constructive measures.We hope that those who consider rejection of these amendments can give both the parliament and their work seeking citizens for their decision.In her report, Ms. Flautre also referred to an area that lacks coordination, although there is a need for considerable coordination.The Commission's proposals relate to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five areas of the European Social Fund.However, the lack of concrete guidelines is all the more regrettable than the idea of ​​linking the ESF interventions with the employment strategy are implemented for the first time in the planning period 2000-2006.In any case, this failure gives the impression that the Commission does not know how comprehensive coordination between the ESF interventions that are subject to an exam after three and a half years and the annual national action plans for the employment of the Member States.We hope that the Commission can convince us that this is only an accident that is immediately corrected.President, Lord, ladies and gentlemen!The proposal submitted by the Commission in fulfilling its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.However, I would like to emphasize at this point that this starting point shows us the challenges before us: given the changes in the economic activities of all kinds as a result of the dwindling importance of the agricultural sector within the various sources of income in rural society.Together with the inadequacies in the infrastructure and in the service sector and a generally very sparse, strongly seasonal and less diversified employment offer, they strengthen the emigration from rural areas.The consequences are not a long time coming.It is the young people who migrate, those who find training and employment outside of rural areas, which has a very unfavorable effect in these regions.This lack of infrastructure is in turn an obstacle to the settlement of companies and the creation of jobs.One has to keep in mind that the rural area is almost four fifths of the European Union territory.Agriculture only provides 5.5 % of the Union's jobs.In addition, three quarters of our farmers are dependent on sideline farmers and additional sources of income.For this reason, it is one of the most important and far -reaching goals that we should face in the European Union, to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside the agricultural sector, including in the areas of rural tourism, sport, culture, renovation of resources, changeover of companies, new technologies, services, etc.Only to prevent the economic and social decline of rural areas and the emergence of other ghost cities, but also because the farmers have a fundamental role in the management of the territory, the preservation of biodiversity and environmental protection.That is why we stand up for an agricultural policy and a rural development that is in line with our goals, as well as that rural areas on the threshold of the 21st century must be competitive and multifunctional, both with regard to the agricultural aspect and with regard to the opening for the variety of agricultural activities.	de
Cooperation in legal and internal matters was significantly influenced by the changes caused by the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, and in particular the inclusion of the Schengen Code in the Union. It must be admitted that the German presidency was an important task in this sense, as it was during this that moved from the Maastricht system to the Amsterdam system. At the beginning of the Finnish Presidency, the activities of Europoli began on July 1. The third significant event was the Tampere Summit, where the European Council dealt solely on legal and internal matters. The Tampere Summit was characterized by a new spirit, and at that meeting confirmed that the area based on freedom, security and justice will be at the forefront of the political agenda. Here, the Presidential State Portugal also confirms in its own part that issues related to freedom, security and justice will continue to remain at the forefront of our will. When answering the questions that Parliament Member Anna Terrón I Cusí, for his part, I try to deal with the aspects of internal issues, and then my colleague examines the aspects of the legal matters. As is known, Schengen's rule is fully applied in ten countries, and we strive to make a decision to bring the Schengen Code in Denmark, Finland and Sweden and Iceland and Norway during 2000. The Secretary -General of the Council has drawn up a series of publications, which includes the entire Schengen Code and will be published in the official magazine after the completion of all language versions. Currently, it is available in six languages ​​and other language versions are currently being finished. One of the issues is related to programs on immigration and asylum rights and their application in the Country countries. In March 1998, the Council approved the Odysseys program aimed at promoting education, exchange and cooperation in the field of policies concerning the right of asylum, immigration and crossing outside borders. The program has been introduced in each of the 15 Member States and may include the applicant states and possibly some third countries. The program covers the period between 1998 and 2002 and the guideline funding for its implementation is EUR 12 million. The countries applying for membership may be included in projects selected by the Administrative Committee where their involvement is appropriate for the program's objectives. The financial framework for 2000 is EUR 3 million. In 1999, the Commission received 80 applications for a total of EUR 7.5 million in funding, and the available financial framework for 1999 is EUR 3 million. The Commission will submit 35 projects with less than EUR 50,000 for 12 projects and more than EUR 50,000 for the projects for 12 projects. During the Framework of the Oisin program, projects related to seminars, training, exchange of officials, research and operational activities were approved during the 97 financial year. There were a total of 62 projects and seven of them concerned the applicant states. In this context, it should be noted on the operation of the Schengen Information System that all Member States have been very positive about its operations and use. The system has produced more results, and the number of reporting is also growing. In order to develop the customs information system, a special method has been agreed with the Commission units that can ensure the functionality of the system already in connection with its temporary use as soon as the customs information system has been ratified in many countries. A Member of the Parliament also discussed the agreement between the institutions in his speech. I should really talk about this only after my colleague in charge of the lawsuit has been able to use the speech, but of course the aspects that bring out in this context are the result of a change in opinions in the Council, and especially between my colleagues and me. In addition to what I previously mentioned about the new and more close contact between the Commission and Parliament and the possibility of Parliament in good time to obtain information in the Council in good time, I would like to promise that the European Parliament will be consulted and that it will be given the necessary information otherWe consider it appropriate to hear Parliament in other things, and Parliament will also be in direct contact with the Commission on matters where Parliament's statement is necessary.	fi
Anyone who, and unfortunately exist women among them, leave men carefree climbing on the career scale, only taking place for posts in kindergartens, without fighting the unequal distribution of reproductive work, they have not realized what mainstreaming means! Mr President, Honorable Ladies and Gentlemen, at its final meeting, the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee approved this opinion on the Equal report without opposing votes and with one abstention. I consciously put it at the beginning of my speech to make it clear that there is indeed a opposition to the substantive employment committee. This approval of the opinion by all groups is based on the conclusions related to the link between Regional and Transport Policy issues as well as tourism with the aspects of the fight against all kinds of discrimination and inequalities in relation to the labor market. Members of the Regional Policy Committee, of course, also see a number of critical points in the committee's proposal, such as, for example, the inadequate defining thematic orientations for activities of the development partnerships, secondly, the strict selection criteria, which must still be processed byfor the management of the Commission programs as well as the competent authorities of the technical assistance. For this reason, a ceiling for administrative content duties must be set. The Commission convened conclusions from these critical observations. We have given particular importance to the connection of the creation of new jobs for disadvantaged and marginalized individuals in the social and tourism sectors, as well as in the area of ​​small and medium -sized enterprises, promoting the establishment of new small and medium -sized enterprises, taking into account the necessary economic structural change. The assembly of activities in the context of the Community initiative with European employment initiatives is an essential requirement and a basic prerequisite for achieving the Equal program objectives. We explicitly support the innovative approach to the creation of international development partnerships and the organization of the exchange of experiences at European level as an integral part of the Equal program. The special direction of the goals, the achievement of a European benefit, elevates regional cooperation at the European level, maintaining the cooperation of the various regional bodies. This is good, and it is the reason why we supported it. Dear Mr President, dear main rapporteurs, dear listeners, thank you to the rapporteurs, who prepared specialized reports in a short period of time. In my team, however, the timetable of the preparation of the committee of the committee was adversely commented on. The reports were delayed, and in addition, the processing, at least in the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee, has been very hurried. So we missed a good opportunity to discuss the results, good practices and also the shortcomings of the previous programs. As far as the Interreg program is concerned, our team emphasizes cross -border action and in particular the cooperation that is directed beyond the Union's external borders. Important areas are, among other things, the areas of the Balkans and the Adriatic, but in my opinion it is not necessary to forget about the cooperation we can have with Russia.	el
What is characteristic of this plan-framework plan is, of course, that the obligations of the Member States are determined in detail, that there is no freedom of choice in terms of application. In my opinion, this contradicts the context of the legal basis. I would like to have an answer from the Commission and the Council, because I find it self -evident that Article 31 does not provide a legal basis. Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, I would like to start congratulating the rapporteur, thank her, and emphasize that in her report not only the plan of the framework decision, but also suggested some amendments, which were also mentioned in the various interventions and interventions. The point is to continue the success of the euro and we must do everything in order for this success to not be inflicted or challenged by the taking of insufficient anti -counterfeit measures - we know that first attempts have been made. We all pointed out that this phase of adaptation also means insecurities and dangers. Consequently, in addition to the work to combat counterfeiting and the normal implementation of the provisions, the scheduled information campaign must of course play an important role, with which we need to deal intensively in the future. But these are also cooperation issues. We need a precise definition of the ECB's responsibilities, national central banks, the Commission and Europol on all issues related to the counterfeiting of the euro. I am also wondering if it would be necessary to create an organic or community council that would be responsible for coordinating cooperation. This is also related to the creation of a early warning system that will work on a 24 -hour basis, as well as the creation of a joint system of information on the rapid exchange of data between the competent authorities. Along with the report, which we welcome, many questions have emerged that need to be clarified. I hope that the discussion we hold here will bring some more clarifications. Mr President, Honorable Rapporteur, Honorable MPs, how safe is the euro? This question is very often asked by the population. It is natural that this question will be increasingly pressing as January 1, 2002, the date on which the euro will be released. Because the question of how safe the euro is not only concerns the stability of the coin and its external value, but also the issue of the protection of the euro from counterfeiting. And this is concerned with the population, because, as it was justified, this currency is something new to citizens, both in its appearance and its use. Of course, for the citizens of the Member States, it will also be something new that their currency applies to such a large area and will be a top currency even beyond Europe's borders. People should first get used to it. Thus, it is obvious that the EU will ask what the EU will ask to ensure that the euro is not for countering.	el
Mr. President, Commissioner, Ladies and Lords, after I have noted the Commission on the Community Initiative Interreg III and remember that I was at the level of the report on the report of Mr. Decourière at the level of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, it is not only my heart to underline our basic consent with the initiative in its current form,But also in particular in connection with Interreg III B to urge the recognition of activities by the Commission, which lead to a renewal of the landscapes damaged by agricultural prices and in which numerous associations and, above all, hunting associations participate with great commitment.I would also like to expressly support the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, especially what the disappointment about the non -recording of the regions in the extreme outer layer in the orientation A of the program and the regret in the face of inaccurate selection criteria for the implementation modalities of orientation III C and finally the question of the participation of the MPs in the work of the observation center for cross -border, transregional cooperation and inter -regional cooperationregards.Furthermore, I have great reservations about the tendency to be observed in the Commission to Interreg III and III B, to assign environmental protection exclusively to the development of Natura 2000.This often seems to me to be excluded or severely restricted as an abstract means of protecting the ecosystems, the users of which face danger.Finally, I would like to emphasize and appeal to the understanding of the Commission and the ministerial councils in advance that it would be appropriate to better inform the European representatives about the procedures associated with the implementation of the dossiers of Interreg and also from comparable initiatives.It would be even better to integrate them more strongly in the draft and implementation process of the relevant programs, otherwise they are difficult to perceive their role in the local authorities, the national authorities and even the guarantors.President!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the Equal report, Ms. Stenzel, to make this difficult matter understandable to all of us.Equal is an extremely complicated program because it is trying to put together various old programs and still assume a new approach, and were available with fewer means than with the forerunner funds.It's not that easy.Only the number of people reached by these programs has not really decreased.That is why it is difficult to find a balance, not only between the individual countries, between the individual sub -areas, but in particular also between the target groups listed in the program.And that is exactly what we have basically dealt with.Some said that one group had to get more than the other.I myself have primarily dealt with the position of the disabled and older people in the program, which I mean, I would have been forgotten occasionally if the European Parliament had not accepted it intensively.Although other groups are listed, the Member States in particular are in wait.A Member State I know, for example, wants to use a considerable part of the entire program for a single sub -area, namely for the refugees.	de
We can take initiatives with you. Finally, I find it very positive that you are so often talking about civil society, but unfortunately this is one internal contradiction. You should also draw conclusions at the inter -governmental conference. It is necessary to take initiatives that citizens can really influence decision -making. It is quite true what you just said to us: People want more participatory democracy. I think this is the only opportunity if we want to make people accept Europe and get interested in Europe. Mr President, the reform and democratization of the European Union's institutions is essential for the historical and moral challenge of the expansion process. This was the first statement of the Commission chairman, Prod, when he presented the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years. We are looking forward to a white book on the European Union's administration, dealing with the balance between Member States and the institutions of the European Union and will be published this summer. It is for this point that I think it is important that we renew the internal decision -making procedures of the Commission. The Commission has stated in its proposals for the future inter -governmental conference that it is in favor of the fact that small Member States lose their automatic right to appoint a member to the European Commission. This is related to a scenario in which there are more than 25 Member States in the European Union. I do not want to be born on the two floors of the European Union. In my opinion, this would war against the spirit and goal of the Rome Agreement and all subsequent basic agreements. National representation must be equal in the Commission and in all other Union institutions. I would like to remind those who want to eliminate the right to appoint a member of small Member States to the European Commission that the United States of America will give small states the same recognition as the big states in the US Senate. Almost every 50 US 50 states have two seats in the US Senate, regardless of its population. All future changes to the European Union's Basic Treaties require a referendum in my country. Those who intend to vote for future basic agreements would be very difficult to receive the support of the Irish people if we lose our rights to appoint a member of the European Commission. Undoubtedly, the European Council's reform is included in this white book on the European Union's administration, which will be published this summer. Once again, there are decision -making areas that should be left in the field of national Member States. I do not believe that the introduction of a qualified majority vote in Europe, in taxation, legal and internal matters, and external issues at the European Union would be widely supported in Europe. Currently, decisions on tax changes to EU level must be made unanimously under Article 99 of the Rome Agreement. I believe that this should be the case, as the common tax rules of the Union would weaken rather than to enhance the European Union's work. I am in favor of expanding the European Union. I am in favor of institutional changes to expand the Union streamlined and structured. However, we must remember that the general opinion of 370 million European Union citizens is a key factor in changing the EU's basic agreements. Changes should not be made too fast and should not be too deep, or otherwise public opinion will make the European Union's up -to -date rating of future European Union. Mr President, I use my speech in the name of the Italian radical group. Mr President of the Commission, you said a moment ago that no political structure would produce five -year plans. This is true if we think about plans in Russia in the 30s, but a few months ago, at the beginning of your term, you yourself announced at the Presidential Meeting that you would present the parliamentary program, that is, the big lines you have led, and we have deepened today. However, if a government program or a program on the guidelines is now necessary, the review of the document and the speech on it will reveal them rather to a list of good intentions, or rather, as a list of problems that do not give the Commission clearly address any of these facts.	fi
This has nothing to do with the lack of commitment to improve human rights, but shows our usual efforts for the right strategy so that we can really achieve something.I would like to explain these efforts from the example of three controversial topics: the death penalty, Cuba and China.I will incorporate one or two personal views into my explanations, even if this may be unclear.We are currently examining the opportunity to present a decision on the death penalty in the Human Rights Commission.For me, this has always been a topic of great personal interest, and I have always spoken out against the death penalty.Inspired by Amnesty International and others, the abolition of the death penalty was one of my first official acts that I met as governor of Hong Kong.We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.We were forced to put our application to the death penalty to prevent the adoption of a resolution that contains completely unacceptable arguments and that would have led to the fact that human rights are not applied universally and are not valid everywhere.The stage in New York differs from that in Geneva.The topics of sovereignty and intervention for humanitarian reasons, which was discussed in New York last year, were so sensitive areas that all other topics were influenced.This had certainly also had an impact on the discussion about a moratorium for the death penalty.However, the focus of the debate in Geneva will primarily focus on human rights issues.Therefore, progress may be possible in Geneva.The second point is about Cuba.I would like to address this topic directly because we are wrongly criticized in Europe not to take the human rights violations there seriously enough.We are very concerned about the measures that the Cuban government took last year to circumcise the freedom of citizens.This includes, for example, changes in the Criminal Code and the expansion of the death penalty.We are also very concerned about the recent increase in political improvements.We pursue the human rights situation on the reports of the NROs and the work of our working group for human rights established in the EU messages in Havana.We regularly informed the Cuban authorities about the points we criticize, and this parliament also did this.However, I think it is wrong to isolate Cuba.We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba in which the principles of the market economy and the rule of law are respected and contracts are observed.We would like to promote the transition to democracy and strengthen respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Many of these positions also apply to my third topic: China.I am, simple and simple, for making our position against China clear.Another attitude would not only be comfortable and nonsensical, it would be more offensive than a fifth of humanity.I hope that China is going to a peaceful development towards a free and pluralistic society in which people are not brought behind grids that are committed to democracy or belong to a religious community.So how should we proceed?In any case, we should drive intensive trade with China and hope that we can include China in the world trade organization under reasonable conditions.	de
"We agree on this point and I believe that the result we bring this evening, despite the lack of funding, will be used to largely relaunch this strategy and this opportunity for Europe which determines an economic and development factor: the culture therefore, the institutional and organizational component of a large community such as presupposes economic development, and not the opposite, as perhaps envisaged in the past, with a cultural habit.Man, culture have priority, and this culture can induce economic development.Let us observe this result, let us rejoice and award a certificate of great opening in the face of a useful strategy.Madam President, allow me, first of all, to thank Mr. Graça Moura for having managed to sneak into the texture of this fabric of conciliation.It seems to me that, starting the process of conciliation relating to Culture 2000, it is quite suitable that a poet guides us in our efforts.Once again, because these consultations are not entirely without difficulty, we must thank the vice-president, Mr. Imbeni, for his exemplary capacities to negotiate a complex aspect: to ensure that cultural expenditure is carried out with wisdom and that they are granted to us, within our community.The fundamental question, in my opinion, which arises in Parliament, the Commission and the Council is as follows: what is Europe?What does it mean and what does it bring us in addition to the parameters of our national borders?Europe is made of its citizens, its history and now of its community, but this is the reason why Culture 2000 is so important for us: I bet that when we ask the question ""what is Europe"", we answer with ""our art, our literature and our heritage"".This is what Culture 2000 represents. This program offers the possibility of maintaining a European identity in the 21st century, an identity that avoids echoes of division, war, poverty, opportunity, poverty in reality.More than that, and it is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we are able to learn the lesson from previous political initiatives by putting them in new, horizontal programs and which benefit our creative industries insofar as they need it.He encourages mobility, and he opens the doors of culture to disadvantaged and excluded people at the social level.My only regret is that we did not have sufficient funding, in promoting this program, to reach our aspirations and guarantee our capacity for realization.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, here we are at the end of a long journey.After the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new ""Culture 2000"" framework program.We will thus have a tool completely able to develop, over the next five years, a clear, well structured action and, I am sure, fruitful, in favor of the cultural sector.It is with satisfaction that I salute here today this happy end and I thank you."	fr
We do that, the means and programs are there.I need - I have to tell you clearly - this financial regulation, which is available for decision here so that we can even start.The Finance Ordinance is the legal framework for the priorities provided for in the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.I can't start anything as long as we don't have it because I lack the legal basis.If the defendant lack of coherence should have something to do with this point, I have to say that this regulation is only a legal framework and nothing more.You can find the completion of this legal framework in the priorities of the accession partnerships, which were decided last year by the Commission and Council and the now in the corresponding programming and in the management of the projects.On the contrary, I would say: There are many areas in European politics where you can complain about a lack of coherence.In this case, I would also like to claim for the Commission and the Council that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.President, Mr. Council President!After the Lord commissioner explained to us in an extremely coherent way that the lack of coherence was the responsibility of the then President of the Council and his Minister of State, they might help us and the Lord Commissioner so that this decision can be taken here.A helpful solution would be if you answer my questions about the financial foresight by 2004 and the B7 heading or at least express that - like the Lord Commissioner in the Commission will try to get this - the Portuguese Presidency has the intention of compensating for the lack of coherence from back then.President!I think the question that the MP and my friend Elmar Brok has raised will be carefully checked by the council.I think the criticism practiced in the previous presidency is not appropriate.In my opinion, the previous presidency in the definition of the financial foresight did an excellent job, regardless of the people who were involved.In any case, this is an important question, and we will definitely support the commission's proposals in this regard at the council level.Herr Council President, I understood;The colleague Brok actually meant an earlier past presidency.President!I had asked Commissioner Verhogen a specific question about the financing instrument Meda, which he did not answer.I would like to ask him about it, because his answer also depends on the voting behavior of various amendments that are available to us.Dear Mr. Poos, I apologize.There was a ambiguity at the point where they asked me the question.So at Meda it is the case that Malta and Cyprus can participate in the national programs, not in the country -specific because the income is too high.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Verheugen!The pronunciation is closed.The vote takes place on Thursday.Question time (Council) According to the agenda, the question time follows (B5-0009/2000).We treat the inquiries to the council.	de
"However, according to the SCRS examination, the 6.4 kg regulation in the East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean was insufficiently enforced.The WWF reports that according to Italian, French and Spanish customs services, the illegal catch of red thun and the landing of young fishing increase.I can't and don't want to spread myself further.We are all under time pressure.Mr President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur again, Mr. Gallagher.Thank you very much, Mr. Fischler.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.Fishing and the environment: 2nd report on Bergen According to the agenda, the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna follows on behalf of the Committee for Fisheries on the second report of the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the ""implementation of the conclusions of the ministerial meeting via fishing and environment from March 13th and March 1997 in Bergen"" (KOM (KOM)-C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)).President, Mr. Fischler, ladies and men!The report I have to provide is about the important topic of the integration of the Binom's environmental fishing, which was dealt with at the Minister Meeting in Bergen.This integration has always been concerned with this integration, because we would do a bad service for fishing and the fishermen of tomorrow, we would not understand, emphasize the need to maintain the stocks, ultimately to put responsibility.Not to do this would not only for our fishermen and European citizens, but - even more seriously - for all of humanity today bread, but tomorrow mean hunger.The common fishing policy in this area is theoretically very demanding and strict, perhaps more than many people - many Europeans and many non -Europeans can imagine.For this reason, I asked the European Commission to publish a publication in which an inventory of all measures of common fishing policy is carried out for the preservation and protection of the stocks in order to use the spread of our protective measures.We also asked the GD4 of our parliament to develop a systematic study of these measures for which members of our fishing committee.The revision of the common fishing policy in 2002 is the largest challenge to make a comprehensive review, modernization - or update if you will - the common fishing policy as a whole.I insist on the whole and consequently also that the protection of fishing stocks in common fishing policy is taken into account.This lies the meaning of my demand to the European Commission and the services of our parliament.I do not believe that the condition of the sticks or the scandalous current system of the stubs are a good example of the quality of the system, which in my opinion therefore requires significant improvements.I cannot and do not want to spread it too much, we are all aware of the relentlessness of the clock and also the working hours of the interpreter.Therefore, I want to remind you that Bergen is a very important example of what the creation of a real marine policy must look like.As the acting council president at the announcement that the current Portuguese presidency wants to achieve that fishing is regarded as a policy aimed at the preservation of our sustainable resources, before our committee, this must be our goal in Europe and on the planet."	de
The same goes for amendment 2, which we would also consider acceptable for a small modification, the fundamental idea seems to us correct.Amendment 4 has the same characteristics a little.On this specific point, we could possibly give greater satisfaction to Mr. Bourlanges.We have already asked the Council to include in its decision a declaration of the Commission establishing this element of conditionality.What we propose precisely, concerning the second tranche is that we decide on the exact amount and the moment when the second tranche will be implemented, taking into account the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contribution of other bilateral donors.In other words, we do not impose conditionality, or we think it is more effective not to impose conditionality from the start, but we impose it during the possible granting of the second tranche.Thus we would not experience any problems to act immediately, we would not create any problems for the population of Kosovo, but, on the other hand, we would force other donors to fulfill their financial effort in the same way as we do.Ms. Dührkop raised a third problem in the field of multi -year programs.The projects are, as a reminder, multi -year.Programs must of course take into account annual budgetary contributions.Finally, I would like to make a remark on the wishes of additional information that you ask us.On the one hand, we were asked to provide Parliament with the evolution of tenders and in this regard, I can tell you that the Commission already had the opportunity, last week, to provide the Commission on the Budgets of Parliament, the last state of contracts and payments made since the Task Force was set up in Kosovo.The Commission may commit to continuing to regularly hold the informed Parliament of published calls for tenders.We also want them to also be published on the Internet, in order to ensure the greatest transparency on this specific point.A second point on which I would like to make a remark is the remaining information which can be important for Parliament with regard to the execution of macroeconomic assistance.On this subject, I also communicate to you that the Commission is willing to regularly inform the chairmen of the various interested parliamentary commissions, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided, and on the various diagrams which are implemented for macroeconomic assistance operations.Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, Hoping that we can, with the final decision of the Council, unlock these funds and make a positive contribution allowing us to pursue the important effort that both are making to improve the coexistence and peace that we all want.Mr. President, I welcome the convergence of views that exists between Parliament, the Budget Commission in particular, and the Commission, and we ensure that, on our behalf, we will always be faithful to the appointment to help the Commission to assume its task.	fr
We want to ensure that Article 1 of the Directive promotes sustainable, effective, fair and solidarity use of water. Now, I am briefly looking at the main questions where Spanish socialist members have some differences of opinion compared to certain aspects of defended here. First, there is a question of water transplants. It would be better for us if they were not left in the future Framework Directive under the control of the Community. We consider that, given the nature of the waterways in Spain, which implements structural transplants in nature, the authorities of the country must be able to decide on the water resources of their area. This decision should, of course, always be made on the basis of cohesion and sensible criteria for the use of water. As for one of the most controversial topics of our discussion, namely pricing, we Spanish Socialists have defended that, respecting the pollutant pays principle, the directive would promote reasonable prices for all consumption levels. It is clear that in Spain, a policy on covering the total cost of water would not affect the same way as in Central and Northern Europe. The price of water used for many different purposes in Spain would rise precisely because the water resources are scarce and the environmental costs are fully covered, which is necessary in accordance with the provisions of the Directive. Therefore, we have always defended a gradual cost-to-cover system, a system that would well take into account the social, environmental and economic effects, and the application would be adapted to a variety of geographical and climate conditions. We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment. However, the environmentally sustainable Europe cannot be built at different speeds, but must be built severally. Mr President, the Danube's environmental disaster reminds us of how closely all European countries are and how important water is for all of us. The emissions of my constituencies in northwestern England, chemical factories end up on the shores of continental Europe. This makes us understand the connections that bind us to each other. The purpose of this Framework Directive is to paint the policy of the coming decades of brushes, and the details have created a lot of panic. It is important to remember that this is a frame. These brushes are really very wide. It is easy for individual countries and individual industries to escape the effects of events in recent days. There are many occasions for escape. The reality is that the details of this legislation will be explored in the Daughter Directives in the coming months and years. Then it's time to discuss some of these details problems. We should certainly be able to accept the general principles - the general principles that we want to reduce the amount of dangerous waste in groundwater, the general principles that we should try to ensure that the chemicals we all need in society in all circumstances will not reach our waterways. Northwest England has a chemical factory that I was written that we had to vote against this legislation. I should ask them what chemicals they fall into the water today and why they don't tell all the residents of the area, what they are doing exactly. They don't want to have to tell it. The principle also applies to water fees. Many of us now agree that we need to introduce environmental taxes to protect water bodies and use the carrot and stick approach to use our funds in the best way, so that we do not increase the pollution or wasted of valuable water -like natural resources. I want to refer to the political position here. In the common position, the position approved by Parliament has been weakened. Some NGOs would say that the directive is worse in this form. It's a step back. We now have the opportunity to improve the situation. We need to get into the mediation phase. Several votes have been lost. There have been several measures from the Environmental Committee. We have not been able to achieve a majority. We have not been able to improve the European environment. We need to get into the mediation phase. We need to make sure that we finally have a sensible, balanced policy that provides real improvements at affordable prices.	fi
"The Commission would like the role played by the joint assembly to be more important, in particular with a view to promoting a larger political dialogue with our development partners.The Commission divides the opinion of the rapporteur according to which the fight against poverty must continue to constitute a priority objective of the development policy and it must continue to play a key role.However, to be able to develop, countries must be actively involved in the global economic system.In terms of trade with our development partners, the Commission is entirely willing to guarantee the fact that individual economic and social executives in ACP countries are taken into account during any new arrangement.Ms. Lucas said that Stabex and Sysmin systems should be continued.I do not believe it personally.These systems have proven to be inadequate, because they actually only benefit from a very small number of countries among the 71 countries concerned.These systems are too slow and it is therefore normal that the developing countries have said ""yes"" to the new system that will be used in the future, because it will be more flexible.With regard to the future membership of certain countries to the Lomé Convention, such as, for example, the East Timor, I can only repeat the remarks that I recently made before the European Parliament Development Commission, namely that the door was open to them.It is the responsibility of the candidate countries to decide themselves if they want to introduce themselves.We will then take up position towards them.With regard to Cuba's membership request to the Lomé Convention, the Commission noted that, on the basis of their recent declaration, the ACP states will support the request made by Cuba.The EU has always pleaded in favor of a constructive attitude towards Cuba - the common position of the EU demonstrates it - but it must be recognized that the discussions will be complicated.Regarding Côte d'Ivoire, I can announce that the 28 million euros have been reimbursed in their entirety, in accordance with the agreement concluded following the examination of financial irregularities noted.With regard to the financing of the European Development Fund through the budget, I will declare that this point is currently the subject of an examination.For its part, the Commission is favorable, but we cannot, at this stage, make new declarations as to the date from which it will be possible or on the way of getting there.Regarding article 366a, I will tell you that a new procedure was created, during negotiations relating to a new partnership agreement, for the examination of cases of human rights violations, democratic principles and the principle of the rule of law.As is already the case today, the Parliament will continue, after the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty and on the basis of article 300, to be fully informed of all the decisions taken, and the Commission will continue to take into account the resolutions adopted by the Parliament on this subject.It is not planned, within the framework of such decisions, to follow the procedure of asking the Parliament to issue a concordant opinion.This would require a modification of the Amsterdam Treaty, which has just been signed."	fr
"However, precisely, all the communication of the Commission is built on the opposite premise, according to which it would be necessary, under the pretext of better defending peoples, always limiting their margin of autonomous choice by new regulations, new integrations of policy or new binding legal structures such as the so -called charter project, very wrongly, fundamental rights.I underline ""well wrongly"" since in fact, it will reduce these rights.To the Europe of Nations Group, our principles are very different.We want to defend the countries of Europe, but also to respect the choices of peoples.It is not at all the quadrature of the circle.We must indeed get out of the outdated federalist patterns, the patterns of those whose all the ideas, in European matters, come from the memories of Jean Monnet.On the contrary, it is necessary to open European institutions on the modern world by inventing a dynamic of variable geometry respecting nations.This is the big idea on the new governance that we would have liked to find in your communication, Mr. President, unfortunately, she was not there.Madam President, Mr. Chairman of the Commission, you pretend to give form to a new Europe but you lack, alas, an essential condition: confidence.We cannot, in fact, attract the confidence of millions of Europeans when we are not worthy.And how would you be trustworthy after the crazy cow affair, after the resignation of the Santer commission for corruption?You carry the responsibility of millions of unemployed and millions of poor, precariousness, and growing misery because of your ultra-swandling and ultra-liberal policies, because of forced march to the single currency.You wanted and organized the disappearance of the interior borders and you have thus delivered Europe to the explosion of crime and insecurity, to the surge of immigration without control.You propose today to give all the decision -making power to a handful of civil servants by making states, local communities and NGOs, all put on an equality foot in their submission to Brussels, simple performers from decisions from above.Not once, in your fourteen -page document, national parliaments are mentioned, however composed of elected officials of the people.But it is true that they have no role in your strategy.You do not even dare to call things by name and you take refuge behind a pseudo-crossed semantics to call ""governance"" which is nothing other than a federal, autocratic and centralized government.After having, for years, attempted to convince by speaking of shared sovereignty, you admit today your ultimate goal: to sell off all European sovereignty, whether it is national or collective, to a world government, in which you do not even hope to obtain a preponderant place.Finally, you dare to condemn and sanction, or allow to condemn and sanction, the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians on the sole reason that the result does not proclaim you.And, at the same time, you support Communist China, you trade with countries that openly violate human rights for decades.Even today, European deputies go up to the niche against a telegram from Mr. Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel, who, however, obviously, is not a manifestation of sympathy, but a political fond."	fr
"Thus, the proposal presented to us today is an attempt to cover up these shortcomings by referring to Article 31 (e) of the European Union and to Article 34 (2) (b). However, in my opinion, there is no appropriate legal basis at these points. Article 31 of that Agreement allows the common minimum rules for the crime that fulfill the crime of crime only in certain border cases, which include organized crime, terrorism and illegal drug trafficking. The counterfeit of money is not mentioned in that article. In Article 34 amended by the Amsterdam Agreement, I would say that it merely mentions a new form of decision -making, that is, the framework decisions that can be applied only within the current competences of the Union. This is how we get back to the problem I mentioned above. Thus, the Council has not succeeded in creating a credible legal legal basis for this text. This is some kind of punishment for the dishonesty in which the Council once advertised to the voters the Maastricht agreement. I would also like to express my general opinion. Some time ago, in almost every session period, we had one or more reports of the principle issues for euros. Now, no report has been prepared for the euro for a year, only some of the narrow reports on technical issues, such as this report we discussed today on counterfeiting money. Strategic goals for the 20002005 Commission Communication, which we have discussed this week, does not mention this extensive subject, except in one line stating that Euro coins and vouchers are expected to be reduced on 1 January 2002. This is a truly insignificant mention. However, many basic problems remain unresolved. These include, for example, a worrying lack of interest in public opinion, the fact that only the fight against inflation, the ""federalization"" of currency policy, that is, unifying without the unifying of budget or tax policy, the position of current applicants in the euro, which is not based on the market, so-called membership of the EURfurther. Perhaps it should also be reminded that investors selling dollars for euro purchase have lost 20 % since January 1, 1999. The loss has been 40 % if they have bought bonds, and up to 55 %, in the case of yen sales intended to buy euros. Mr President, even the right euros for these investor poles, are like the wrong money. These are huge problems that seem to be taboos for Parliament. I would continue where the previous speaker stopped. A few principles of principle are important because the starting point is that criminal regulation is a national matter. Criminal law is part of the cultural tradition of every society, and it is very difficult for us to reach a consensus on the common definitions of the content of these legal concepts. I appreciate the work done by Cederschiöld, Parliament, and as a starting point, I will, at the Tampere Summit, take the requirements of the common definitions and the common crime characteristics and what common penalties can be convicted. He would like to deal with these penalties jointly in order to find a uniform penalty system for crimes that have a special meaning to the EU. The problem, however, is that it is not justified and has a good reason for it, as criminal law regulation falls within the competence of Member States. In this context, I would ask the Commission and the Council's representatives the following question: Is it a sufficient legal basis that has been invoked? In my opinion, it is clearly in conflict with Article 34 (2) (b) and goes much further than the point in which the so -called framework decisions, which are binding to the Member States, but where the choice of form and means is left to the bodies of the Member States. It is characteristic of the draft framework to be discussed that the obligations of the Member States are defined in such detail that they do not leave any freedom of choice in forms and means."	fi
"This term also seems to have been deleted from the commission's vocabulary, while liberal and American references are in abundance.Romano Prodi picks up the very controversial ""governance"" concept, controversial because this gives the priority over the priority of the perfect functioning of democracy and because it refers to the term defined by the IMF, whose ideological content is completely shaped by liberalism and monetism.There is no mere semantic difference here.When reading the present document, the idea arises that it is only about the completion of the internal market and the goal of general deregulation and not about the realignment of European politics hoped for by our fellow citizens.Romano Prodi only speaks of ""mechanisms"", of ""structures"", but he does not describe any projects that are balanced and meet the wishes of our peoples.The expansion appears as an end in itself;However, if no social policy, no common values ​​and no institution to strengthen the cohesion and to further democratize the Union, the Europe left at the end of the Presidency Prodi could be a simple space of the common market within the framework of a general globalization and not the community of fate we hoped for.The leniency shown to Austria in no way to convey a message of congratulation - which is not forced to send him in any way - towards Austria, the royalty shown in any way.The European Union does not hold back to significantly announced its expansionist ambitions.The goal of the Commission for the coming five -year period is to become a ""player on the world stage"" who can play ""an original leadership role in the world"".The European Union has not changed.From the beginning, their actions were determined by a few dozen large corporations in the areas of economy and finance and their interest groups.However, the Prodi Commission now wants to change the European Union in order to raise a common leadership claim on the world stage with the United States with which it competes and rival at the same time.This new imperial policy includes a reform of the European and national institutions, strengthening state power, a stricter competition, a European army and the redistribution of funds.The fact that one still dares to speak of the defense of a ""European social model"" is a shameful lie, because the more the European Union opposes the United States, the more it becomes its faithful image.We vote against these goals because we combat such a policy in parliament and on the street.The elaboration of a European Charter of Fundamental rights would be the only small glimmer of hope in this policy, but again it is not intended to make this a matter of the peoples of Europe and to have it decided democratically about it.When voting on the resolution, we found the voice for the following reasons: First, the resolution does not show the indefinence of the priorities and obligations reproduced in the Commission's program.In addition, we believe that the main question with which the Commission must deal with the determination of the priorities for the next 5 years is related to its role in the context of interinstitutional relationships within the EU - and here both the program and the resolution are complete."	de
However, caution is in place in the law so that it must not be subject to excessive regulation, that is, for future legislative projects, you should always ask if they are necessary at all. Third: We have to set this European initiative for the Eeurope fire test. I have already suggested that changes in information technology and new media affect all areas of life. Thus, it is also appropriate for all initiatives at European level to be placed in the Eeurope fire test, that is, in a concrete way ... (President interrupted the speaker.) I apologize. However, I prefer to decide on my sentence. I have spoke inadvertently for too long, but let me emphasize in the last sentence once again that I am very positive about the Eeurope initiative, but the impetus I have given earlier should also be taken into account in my speech. Mr President, congratulations to the member Read for his excellent report and, of course, the Commission member Liikanen are in place today. This is a positive debate, very positive for Europe and has a broad interest, as indicated by a large number of checks. Let me pick the things that I think are most important: infrastructure, legal certainty - people need to know what their situation is - as well as a skill attack that should be targeted not only by schoolchildren and students in groups that have been ignored, such as women and the elderly, who are a huge skill resource. It is a shame that there is no previous need to train in large countries;Now, countries such as Germany and the United Kingdom must bring employees elsewhere. I know that we have to organize a very good advertising and marketing campaign and that we imprison the interest of European citizens. We do not forget about disabled people. The fact must be remembered that document material is not available for visually impaired people, and this is a mistake that can be corrected in the future. We have to prevent divisions, divisions between European regions, between European households and between Europe. Business communication works well, but in the European Union, we need to improve communication between businesses and consumers, where we are behind the United States. In order to do it, we need to make sure that people - customers - are convinced of privacy and safety, and your actions will help you gain that trust. Communication between businesses and consumers is very important for the elderly, home -bound and for those who have family responsibilities and for whom it is difficult to balance with their careers and family, mainly for women. There are ethical issues that we need to pay attention to, but I am very optimistic and I believe the member Read will continue his work with you and we find many advocates in the parliament for Eeurope. Mr President, Dear Members of the Parliament, Mr. Commission Member, Mr. Reporting Reporter, to whom I would like to present in this context my thanks for the open discussion and, of course, the report. Initially, I would like to deal with the approach of the Eeurope initiative and also Member Read's report. Unemployment is supposed to be reduced by using the Internet, email and mobile phones. Reality looks different. The information technology boom is counterbalanced by mergers and redundancies. History also shows that this approach has failed. Industrialization, nuclear power and biotechnology have not brought well -being and freedom to everyone. The initiative and report are marked by the idea that the road towards the information society is to be smoothed to the youngest and the best. Unfortunately, this idea completely ignores the fact that this group is already made up of the winners and the vast majority of the population will be empty. However, this must be the fact that all people are benefited from technical reforms, no matter how old or rich, or they live in any area. We should study the principle of equality of opportunities in its authenticity.	fi
Therefore, after the election victory of a certain party in a large country, you would give me an even more beautiful evening if you would say: We can agree to application No. 3 of the rapporteur!I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this extremely important topic and also express my thanks for the present proposal for the commissioner and the Commission.We welcome the fact that the Portuguese council has set itself the goal of doing something against the scandalous conditions with regard to road traffic safety in the European Union.I know that these numbers are known, but quickly still remembered: 43,000 citizens are killed in traffic accidents every year.So this means that practically every year a medium -sized city is wiped out.We welcome the initiative presented, because at least the attempt is made to ensure that commercial vehicles are as safe as possible and comply with the joint legal provisions.Commercial vehicle traffic on the European roads is constantly increasing, both with regard to the number and the size of the vehicles.In our view, there are three reasons why this proposal is so important.First of all, there is the security argument that has already been mentioned.The second argument that my colleague, Mr. Jarzembowski has already explained, is the fair competition and the need to create the same starting conditions everywhere in the community.The third are the positive environmental aspects, because this proposal makes it possible to use quieter and less environmentally harmful vehicles in the future.Rewage -like checks must be carried out everywhere in the EU.In my country, the United Kingdom, such a system is already practiced with very positive results.This proposal will inevitably have negative effects for the black sheep among the haulers, but the other street users, in particular the vast majority of truck drivers, vehicle owners and drivers who pay conscientiously pay attention to the quality, safety and compliance with the environmental standards, will benefit from this proposal.I welcome this initiative and hope it will be implemented as soon as possible.President, Ms. de Palacio!The amendment to the directive on annual technical monitoring of commercial vehicles is an urgent and important matter.The rapporteur ultimately came to a good conclusion.The commercial vehicles cover a lot of kilometers every year, and their condition can not only be checked efficiently by the annual inspections.Uncerted on the go are also necessary because it is often dilapidated by heavy commercial vehicles from third countries in the Union area, which is a serious security risk.The amendment to the directive aims to significantly increase traffic safety if the regulations can be complied with accordingly and sanctions can be imposed in the event of violations that are effective, targeted and daunting.The efficiency of the directive is increased if the member states can advise on the harmonization of sanctions.However, this must not delay the quick implementation of the directive.An argument for the rapid amendment to the guideline is a case that has recently happened in Finland.The police and surveillance authorities recently checked 62 heavy commercial vehicles during a control in the east of Finland, thirty of which were warned and sixteen with a warning.	de
"It marks the beginning of contractual stabilization of the countries of the former Yugoslavia.These are countries that do not yet come into account for a pre -market agreement.In fact, the present agreement is a kind of ""pre-reception"" but with a view to future membership.This union of countries by active treaties is an excellent instrument provided that the agreed provisions are resolutely respected and that we therefore reach the desired stabilization.Macedonia remains a potential powder maker and all its history testifies to this.However, she has the ambition to get rid of this reputation.To achieve this, it needs internal stability.The new government wants to tackle the question and the agreement can be a reform calendar, including a direct role and an equal position for the Albanian minority.The country above all needs calm now, to get the situation on a good order and find the way for greater prosperity.We, the social democrats, call the opposition to behave in accordance with these notions.They must also contribute to the Macedonian model so tuned here.But the country also and above all needs external stability.What good is the internal stability if the surroundings are unstable?This stability is necessary in relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.The region must recognize that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.External stability means open borders and regional cooperation.Minorities and majorities must have possibilities for cultural and human exchanges.The stability of Macedonia is closely linked to developments in neighboring countries.The Kosovo problem is known, the international community is present en masse.It seems that the Albania factor is underestimated.The Union considers that the moment has not yet come to sign a stability and association agreement with this country.But what does it take then?It is precisely the arguments put forward to conclude such an agreement with Macedonia and not with Albania that concerns us and make us say that an attitude of expectation of the Union towards Albania is not acceptable.What is the Commission for this consideration doing?Yugoslavia is also a weak link in terms of stability and therefore constitutes a threat to a stable Macedonia.We have to wait for the evolution of the situation.Belgrade's mood is becoming more and more unpredictable.However, we support the council's decision to give another inflection to the sanctions.Here is finally a serious attempt to support the opposition which is preparing for a new series of demonstrations.What will the union will undertake another in this sense if the requirement of the opposition - of the early elections - is accepted?What can we do more and what can we do more to support this opposition?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the Kosovo affair marked, hopefully, the end of an era when peoples' law could be interpreted in a way that left dictators the leisure to persecute minorities in the most terrible way, as long as these persecutions took place ""within the nation""."	fr
The rapporteur pointed out to Parliament that the common position of the Council retains six of the ten amendments to the text presented by the Parliament at first reading, as well as the content of the other amendments of the Parliament.Consequently, my group will support the common position and hopes that the legislation will be quickly promulgated, which will provide us with one more tool in our struggle so that transport within the Union reaches the highest level of security possible.My group will also support any initiative to improve transport safety.We still have a lot to do on the matter, as shown in the news.Madam President, I would like to make some comments.I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his extremely precise technical work in this file and then the commission for the proposal she made.This is the harmonization of examination requirements, but also minimum requirements.In a way, it's a shame.The importance of safety on the road, on rails or on navigable waterways is naturally essential and due to the international nature of these modes of transport, we must also harmonize the training of security advisers, as well as, in particular, the requirements of the new ADR which should soon come into force.This is important but respect for these measures is just as much and there are naturally several reasons why we have to pay particular attention to it.Let’s examine road accidents in recent years.For example in Belgium, the Netherlands and in certain other countries in foggy time, with trucks carrying dangerous products, while under these conditions, they should have stayed on the side of the road.Or boatmen and their ships from Eastern Europe who moor their boats side by side, which makes the situations dangerous all the more obvious.In addition, a survey carried out in Belgian, Finnish and Japanese ports revealed that 50 percent of the containers with partially dangerous loading were not properly unloaded.In short, the subject is very important.If we examine the situation of security advisers, since January 1, in some countries, companies must have such an adviser.Respect for this principle poses important problems currently, especially for less important companies which cannot afford it financially.They will either get rid of their cargo, or they will mix it with other cargoes, which generates a series of problems.For this reason, these activities are asked to be developed in the form of annual reports, business analyzes and that they may be taken up in ISO 9002 certificates. The work is done, it is still a question of ensuring their respect.I allow myself to raise a last point.With regard to this respect, it is also necessary to conclude satisfactory agreements with the countries of Eastern Europe because it was not until July 1, 2001, in just over a year and a half, that they will join the conventions in force.	fr
I am sure that international mediation is both desirable and necessary. That is why I would like to agree with what Mr Kofi Annan has said, but I hope that in this context the right to self -determination of the populations involved will be respected. Mr President, for more than a year, in February 1999, there were hopes of a new relationship between India and Pakistan. In Lahore's statement, both prime ministers have put forward that they were determined to comply with the 1972 Simla Agreement. Unfortunately, the Lahore process stopped during the Kargil conflict from May to July 1999. Recent developments in Kassmir raise concerns. We condemn the constant violations of human rights, religious fanaticism, sabotage and terrorism. Causes are the activity of revolutionaries who act cross -border on the Pakistan side, from the line of control, and systematically attack defenseless citizens. The Indians repeatedly accused the government and Islamabad of supporting volunteers with technical and military know -how. Border violations should be prevented even when borders extend to 700 kilometers. The political and military situation must be further stabilized in order to create the right climate for bilateral conversations. The Indian government has already been eager to reopen the negotiations, provided that the border delimitation line was strictly adhered to and limit fundamentalist tendencies. When President Clinton visits Southeast Asia at the end of March - James Elles pointed out - and when we as a Union delegation for South Asia's regional cooperation (SAARC) of the European Parliament we find in April in India, the issue of Kashmir will be the first day. We must work for the goal of approaching these two neighboring states, the Islamic shade of Pakistan and multinational India. It is also the responsibility of Commissioner Patten and the Solana Council's Supreme Representative for the European Union to show that it is successful in international mediation in cases of crisis..(In), first, regarding the presidential election in Peru, the Peruvian authorities invited both the EU and the Commission to send electoral observers. The Commission and the Member States were consulted, which concluded that the situation does not justify the organization and development of a complete EU observers mission. Some Member States have stated, however, that they would send observers on a bilateral basis, including in some cases representatives from their national parliaments. In addition, they support the mission of Observers of the Organization of US State, led by former Guatemalan Foreign Minister Eduardo Stein. Regarding the state of human rights in Chechnya, I will make the following comments. The Commission is also deeply concerned about the growing evidence of human rights violations in Chechnya. We want Russia to comply with the OSCE/Council of Europe's commitments and to seek political settlement of the issue, to allow independent investigations of human rights to be conducted, to improve the climate of the operation of the independent type, and to deal with the lawsuits.	el
All of us, in all European institutions - in parliament, the Council and the Commission - must do the best we can to help Cyprus in its pursuit to reach a peaceful solution that brings these two communities together, which remain separated for many years. Mr President, Honorable Colleagues, Honorable Council President and Honorable Mr. Verheugen Commissioner, the regulation on pre -accessive assistance is not the best proof of the Commission's coherent work. This auxiliary construction is probably giving me the impression of amateur work, both in terms of configuration of content and in the fiscal technical aspect. I believe that with this regulation we will hardly be able to present to the citizens of Cyprus and Malta the Union's pre -accessible activities as proof that it is worthwhile to join it. Today, Vaclav Havel said very well that the political quality of the European Union will be judged by what it will bring to each individual. From the point of view of civil society it is important what a regulation does. With this regulation we cannot receive any prize in this. It contains heterosexual paragraphs and is temporary, which does not make it stand out. The quality of aid is judged on the basis of the followers: if it is decentralized, if it is transparent, if it approaches the citizen and if it is functional. However, for the divided Cypriot, this approach strategy is linked to a great political challenge. From my point of view, the task of the European Union is to use every means, and this particular, to contribute to a political resolution of the crisis on the island. At this point I must say that the European Parliament's amendment is especially important to me. Today, both the Council and the Commission speak in words full of hope. I feel very happy to be walking here in the same direction. I believe that the choice we should prefer is to accept Cyprus in the European Union along with a peaceful solution to the Cyprus problem. Mr Council President, Mr Commissioner, in the opinion of the Communist Party of Greece, Cyprus's main problem is not its accession to the European Union, but the continued occupation of 40% of Cypriot territory for 26 years. The future of the Cypriot people pass through the unity of this small country, regardless of the national origin of each Cypriot. The only acceptable solution that guarantees the future, which will not provide foreign interventions like those that have caused all the problems of the last fifty years, is the single and federal Cyprus, according to UN Security Council resolutions. The key to the solution of the Cyprus problem lies in the hands of the Turkish government that supports and encourages the intolerance of Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash. For its part, the European Union, with its hypocritical interest in freedom and human rights, was never moved by the drama of the Cypriot people, by the problem of refugees of Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, by the violent change in the population composition of Northern Cyprus by the Turks.	el
So far, the states calculated this GDP in accordance with the methodology of the ESVG 79. The last assessment that we have was sent in September 1999 and refers to the 1998 accounting year. If the present regulation is accepted, the first assessment of the deficit of the accounting year 1999 will be already carried out according to this new system.As is known, the Member States did their debt - if you can express it - they have calculated and created their national accounts in accordance with the ESVG 95 and have already published their corresponding assessments.In addition to the introduction of the new methodology, this requires the nominal review of the majority of the units and invoice processes, both because of the methodological changes mentioned and the better statistical information included in the estimates.Of course, these changes can change the public deficits within the framework of the overall economic invoice of the Member States.I would like to say briefly which the five areas in which the most important changes will occur.First, the adjustments in the delimitation of what is understood as an institutional sector of public administrations in accordance with the ESVG 95.This is important because the public deficit refers to what may achieve all public administrations.The lack of precise criteria for its definition would lead to deviations in the assessments of the public deficits of the Member States.Secondly, the public deficit - or, if necessary, the public surplus - the respective named needs balance or the financing ability of the Sector Public administrations of the ESVG 95. Third, the public investments correspond to the gross investment of the public administrations in accordance with the ESVG 95. Fourth, according to the ESVG 95, the public debt as wellor the resulting streams or interest.Fifth and recently, the aggregate, to which the public deficit refers to, is the gross domestic product at market prices in accordance with the definition of the system of economic overall economic calculations from 1995. In the end, this proposal of the Commission is a correct and concrete adjustment of the criteria specified in the system of 1995, which I consequently assume as a whole, as he haswas explained.President, Herr Commissioner, my dear ladies and gentlemen!Let me tell me at the beginning that my faction welcomes this proposal, because it makes the statistical basis for a economic and monetary union of harmonized, immediately comparable and more precise.We have already heard the different areas.It is crucial for me that from now on the statistical information is more reliable and more comparable.This is necessary because we have to be able to rely on one another: the various organs of the European Union and all Member States within the monetary union.Adjustment of the procedure is important for two reasons.First, for the internal market.Reliable and immediately comparable data and statistics are generally important for an exact presentation of the situation and development in an internal market.Second, for the economic and monetary union.The regulation from 93 on the application of the protocol must be reconciled with the methodology of the European system of overall economic invoice at national and regional level.	de
Secondly, the state of human rights is unbearable, and therefore there is a need to draw a substantial report on human rights infringement on all sides. In addition, there should be definitive guarantees for the rapid and seamless transition of humanitarian organizations to the region. Third, the war must end and the negotiations begin. And fourth, it is necessary for Russia to actively participate in the effort to combat international terrorism and smuggling of weapons. Finally, as far as refugees are concerned, the general rule is for refugees to help near their place of residence and return to their homes. However, if we are not very hypocritical, we should remember that when the Chechens turned to us to provide refugees, we did not accept refugees in our countries from those areas, as we had done on a large scale in the case of Kosovo. At this point we notice that we are pursuing a short -sighted policy. Mr President, dear colleagues, we know that the prestige of Russia has suffered an internationally serious blow from the war in Chechnya. The complete and under international surveillance of human rights violations is also in the political interest of Russia. Only the Russian government does not seem very convinced of it. Only in this way can it be understood that it did not allow UN spokesman Mary Robinson to enter Grozni and the sorting camps. The agreement with Mr Kalamanov, now reached by the Human Rights Council spokesman Gil Robles, is a step in the right direction. But it is not credible unless the two envoys of the Council of Europe can really work independently and move freely and independently in the country. We reject and will not accept any arbitrary interpretation of the agreement by the Russian government. If the Russian government does not comply with this agreement, the Member States of the Union must file a transnational appeal against Russia to the European Court of Human Rights and to ensure that human rights violations are resolved internationally. I can only join Mr. Paasilinna. We must also stop the expulsion of refugees from our countries, as the German government did. We also need to grant the Cezens now political asylum in our countries. It would be very right to adopt the German government's proposals from all Member States. Mr President, without this means that I approve the policy of the Chechen nationalist leaders, I would like to express here, on behalf of my comrades and my own, our indignation before the atrocities committed by the Russian army in Chechnya. It is a repulsive war whose victims are first and foremost the people of Chechnya, but also the young Russian soldiers. But we are also enraged by the attitude of the Western forces, especially Europeans. The recent journey of the British government's president to Moscow, his flatteries to the editor -in -chief, are a typical example of the attitude of all Western powers.	el
We will never remind you of the difficulties that have previously occurred in land and marine areas, which have been separated by the boundaries economically, socially and culturally. These areas have become remote areas in the state, which they have belonged, which have, too often, led to the fact that national authorities have neglected them in their national politics. For this reason, the Interreg community initiative was established as early as 1990. The aim of this program was to promote cross-border, interdisciplinary and inter-regional cooperation, as well as the balanced development of the community to strengthen the Union's economic and social cohesion. The Interreg program aims to mainly finance joint activities in the field of development, education and teaching, cultural, health care, environmental protection and improvement, and energy, transport and telecommunications networks. I emphasize that inter-regional cooperation will contribute to the participation of local and regional authorities in the European integration process. Namely, the more active participation of local and regional authorities in community initiatives must be increased, while taking into account the fact that local and regional authorities often have a very limited opportunity for cooperation, as legal frameworks are many and development levels on both sides of the same boundary. In cross-border cooperation, more attention must be paid to improving the operating conditions for SMEs creating jobs. The funds to be used by the Interreg program must be sufficiently large enough to supplement national employment promotion measures, given that 50 % of unemployment is structural in nature. Problems that are too often associated with taxation (double tax) and social security are, more concretely, a barrier to cross -border mobility, slowing it down or making it particularly problematic. I hope that the projects according to programs will contribute to finding solutions to solve these problems, and that the principle of free movement of employees can be given concrete content, the principle that is in my home region in bad jam! Interreg funds also need to promote the establishment of a European research area. Finally, and most of all, the areas expect very much from this initiative, when locations that are not eligible for the support of target 2 hope to receive a refund for the Interreg initiative! Thus, stakes are significant: the integration of border areas is an important part of the development of Europe's future regional development policy! May everyone understand this, like F. Decourrière, which I congratulate!.(FR) Interreg community initiative is part of Europe's destructive regional policy. With this policy that looks generous, because its official purpose is to help the areas in trouble, French taxpayers have been deceived. France, with a contribution of 17 % of the Union's budget, receives only 8 % of the structural funds referred to in the regions. While the French regions received an average of 15.4 billion francs each year in 19999, they only receive only 14.7 billion in 20002,2006. My region of Nord-Pas-De-Calainen is particularly suffering from this because the French Hainaut loses the subsidies paid to target 1. Removal of aid is unjustified in the area whose main non -operative European Europe has been destroyed. European regional policy also strengthens the central leadership of Brussels, Brussels, with whom the regional authorities are advised to negotiate directly on the use of Structural Funds. This is in Europe, areas that subordinate to Bryssel, more easily subordinate to our nation states. Interreg's initiative established in 1990 to prepare border areas for Europe, which has been removed, that is, nations, is well suited for this way of thinking. However, Member Decourrière presents sensible ideas, revealing the inactivity of the Brussels technocrat, which leads, inter alia, to the late implementation of the Interreg III initiative and thus, in terms of support areas, financial losses. We also agree with him that more attention must be paid to SMEs, and of course, that resorting to external service providers must be rejected, as these methods are the reason for the corruption of the previous Commission. However, these points that seem sensible and for which we vote do not correct the federalist mindset that is characterized by Europe that is characteristic of community initiatives, and especially for Interreg's initiative.	fi
"With the exception of the amendment 76, where I made a mistake, because I wanted to vote for my votes with the following fictional narrative: assumed draft an environmental directive: ""Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the duty to keep a temperature of at least eighteen degrees Celsius in the streets, on the places and in the gardens of European cities"".The main lines of the guideline: a) Each city must equip itself with sufficient energetic and technological means so that this goal is achieved in 2012;b) The costs are fully passed on to all residents of the city as part of the electricity price.Opinion of a MP from Northern Europe: ""This guideline would be unfair, because the costs for a inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times higher than the costs for a resident of Naples"".Opinion of a MP from southern Europe: ""Nevertheless, that is competitiveness and equality of the conditions"".(Fiction ends here.) The MP, who now explains his voting behavior, consider it positive that there is a community directive on the water, but it is of the opinion that Europe cannot be built up with environmental dogmatism, but that one falls into the caricature of legislation.Countries with flood and drought time, such as the Mediterranean countries, cannot be treated just like the countries with a northern precipitation regime.On the other hand, a Europe that makes the water transfers between different water catchment areas practically impossible in the future would be unsolidaric.It should be remembered again that we are working on a project of the political unification of the entire continent.Drinking, eating, washing yourself, ordering fields and much more: we need water for every action of our everyday life.This water is wrongly considered an unchangeable and inexhaustible resource, because such a simple process as opening a tap is apparently a matter of course.But this source threatens to dry up .... All scientific studies now come to the clear conclusion that the water will be the main challenge of the coming years, and this tomorrow.But it will be too late tomorrow.Today we have to clearly formulate the rules of the game before we all become losing.If the European Parliament passes the guideline on water policy today, on February 16, it affects its will to protect surface waters, the coastal waters, inland water and groundwater.Europe now has a framework that enables it to counteract the deterioration of water quality, to promote the sustainable use of the water, to protect the ecosystems, to contribute to the fight against floods and drought and to stop the introduction of dangerous substances.This is a lifeboy that we throw into the water.I am extremely satisfied with this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.The environmental disaster, which is currently haunted by the banks of the Danube, reminds us - if this was still necessary - from the fact that human negligence all too often leads to a endangerment of natural resources, such as water.The aim of this guideline proposal from 1997 is to put an end to the fragmentation that still characterizes the legal regulations in the area of ​​water and to better protect the surface, coastal and internal water as well as the groundwater.The proposal provides a framework that makes it possible to counteract further deterioration, to protect the ecosystems, to promote sustainable use of the water reserves, to contribute to the fight against floods and droughts and to gradually contain the initiation of dangerous substances."	de
"I also believe that the review 9, which aims to bring civilian society involved in the exchange of information and the enforcement of the regulation, is very significant, as discussions in civilian society and good governance policies should not only appear in solemn speeches, but also in active political decision -making. I also support the rapporteur's proposal for a shared commitology, whereby strategic guidelines would be decided in the context of the administrative procedure and the implementation of the advisory procedure..(EN) Hopefully we are approaching the end of the process that began a year ago during the previous Parliament. This topic itself is important, and in addition, this regulation and the associated Tropical Forest Regulation are the first development cooperation regulations that are dealt with in the joint decision procedure. For many of us, this is an interesting learning experience. The previous regulation expired at the end of 1999. Since the beginning of this year, the Commission has not been able to make new financing commitments for these budget points. This has made the very difficult situation of the Commission and Europe. For this reason, we want to make the approval process in the near future. In this context, we have supported the unofficial negotiations between the Council's Presidential State and the Parliament's rapporteur in order to reach a satisfactory solution to both parties. The greatest disagreements have concerned the indicative quantities, the commitology and the validity of the regulation. I would like to comment briefly for each question. For the indicative amount, I would briefly state that we accept the compromise proposals made in the review 11. Commitology: We have supported the management of the Regulation rather than the Administrative Procedure in accordance with the Council Decision of the Council 1999/468/EC, which states: ""Thus, the administrative procedure should be followed by administrative measures, such as those relating to the application of a common agricultural and fishing policy. In our opinion, the program, funded by the regulation, has no significant budget effects and is therefore and therefore does not require an administrative procedure, but the advisory procedure is more appropriate. However, when the Council's view is remembered, and in order to avoid mediation, we support the compromise proposal made by the Parliament on a divided commitology procedure that applies the administrative procedure to decisions on the strategic guidelines of the actions to be financed, whereas the approval of more than EUR 2 million would be applied. Thus, the Commission supports 16, but prefers the wording of 19, 20 and 21 of the checks. However, for the period of validity of the Regulation, we have supported the unlimited period of validity so that the regulation is regularly revised on the basis of evaluation. However, we are aware that if the unlimited term of validity were accepted here, it would inevitably lead to the mediation process. In this context, we consider that the seven years proposed by the Council will be sufficient, and thus, in order to avoid mediation, we do not support the check 18, which removes the validity of the Regulation. The last important issue, which is common to both this and the forest regulation, is the checks on bank security. We agree with the Parliament that the Commission should not impose bureaucratic obstacles to the entry of some NGOs in the funding of the community. For this reason, in July 1999, the Commission decided to claim bank security only over EUR 1 million in advance payments. Thus, this problem is largely solved. In addition, the Commission considers that such matters can best be solved multidisciplinary rather than by special regulations. For these reasons, the Commission does not support the Bank Guarantee Review Proposal 10. The remaining environmental regulation's reviews can be divided into two groups: on the one hand, with amendments to the scope or intervention mechanisms of the draft regulation;On the other hand, the reviews on the management of the actions to be funded, in particular, related to financing. For these two review groups, the Commission's position is as follows. In order to find a compromise solution that could avoid mediation, the Commission could support the checks of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8, even though it does not add value to the text. If you read a common position carefully, you will notice that most of the concerns behind these checks have already been taken into account in accordance with the structure of the regulation."	fi
"It should not be forgotten that 717,000 people came in 1999 to equalize our low birth rate. As a result, societal order is absolutely absolutely important socially conscious immigrant policy, as President Gutierres recently stated in Spain. It is necessary to take care of the situation of people whose job opportunities are threatened or reduced due to economic changes, mergers, mergers, new technologies, etc. Here, it is necessary to qualify and prepare for new jobs and to strengthen him or her, who already has a new chance or give him a new chance, because sometimes the name of the movie turns out to be correct, the postman calls twice. I am modestly believe that it is the responsibility of all national and regional governments of the European Union that the postman will call more than once. In my opinion, the commission member, the Commission, is responsible for accelerating and coordinating these opportunities..(EL) Mr President, I would like to congratulate Andersson for a really meritorious job. His thanks to a broad consensus and would like to thank the members of the Parliament for their help. I would like to make some comments on what has been said. First, I would like to emphasize that the debate on social protection has begun many years ago between the Union's institutions, and in 1995 the first disclosure was born under the title ""Future of Social Protection"" followed by the statements of the European Parliament, compiled by Weiler and Pronk. I think we have progressed significantly because we are already talking about the modernization of social protection. The second point is that we should consider the legal basis on which the Commission can act. You know well that the establishment agreement does not provide a legal basis for European level policies, but there is also a consensus on the European Council last time that coordination measures and experiences of successful programs between Member States will be launched. The third note is that in the four themes that focus on this disclosure, which concerns paid work, the maintenance of pension systems, social cohesion and finally the quality of health care, the horizontal approach is followed by a female issue, because in each of these classes - as the valuable parliamentary members said -In cases, intervening with separate policies. The next paragraph is the concrete actions we have taken. As you know, Portugali, Presidency, has already recommended a high -level expert group that will prepare its first report at the June Summit. The Presidential State Portugal focuses on two topics: sustainable pension systems and social convergence. In my opinion, the proposal for creating a corresponding contact group at Parliament is very positive and can help take the next step after this high -level expert group has been approved. As some comments were made on the role of social protection systems and the importance of social protection and the importance of these systems to the competitiveness of Member States, I would like to point out that European politics are trying to combine competitiveness and social cohesion. Of course, we need to take into account competitiveness, but the planning of social protection must be handled in such a way that it becomes a factor promoting economic growth and employment. In my opinion, this is clearly reflected in the content of the Communication. Good colleagues, our goal in the next few years, after a unanimous decision of the Council, is to progress to the first level of approximation, exchange views, list social problems and create a knowledge base to better reconcile policies. Like many speakers, I also believe that the first step has now been taken. Already at the inter -governmental conference, social policy issues are very widely involved, and I believe that we are in a new phase where social policy is a significant amount of European politics. Thanks to the dignified member of the Commission DiamantoPoulou. The discussion has ended. The vote will be made tomorrow at 11:30. WIPO Copyright Agreement on the agenda is the next Member of the Parliament Member of the Council on the proposal of the Council of the Council on the proposal of the Council of the Council and the WIPO's proposal and audio agreement on behalf of the European Community (Kom (1998) 249- C5-0222222(AVC))."	fi
You also suggest that there is a shortened procedure if the Commission agrees with your suggestion. In response to this, if this particular amendment withdraws by Mr Graefe Zu Baringdorf, in relation to what I said here this afternoon, then it is also true that the process will be shortened and this issue will be able to be addressed in the first reading. If the matter is handled in this way and if the Council votes in accordance with the proposal submitted by the Commission, there is a significant risk that the issue will be referred to a second reading, thereby causing longer delays. It has just been perceived today, in consultation with members of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development, that there is a concern that I did not know: it is about the interaction between Articles 37 and 152. I have made it clear that I am prepared to respond to any of myArticle 37 and Article 152. I say this at the same time that I call on Mr Graefe Zu Baringdorf to examine seriously, in the light of what I just said, withdrawal of this amendment, due to the serious legal difficulties linked to it. In response to Mr Hyland and Mrs Doyle, who are both concerned about the test issue, I have noted what they have said about this and will conduct the appropriate investigations.- (de) Mr President, let me a question to Commissioner Byrne. We are facing a situation where you submit a text that does not correspond to the usual method with the Council. This has taken on our perception. Then we submit our amendments which you consider to be right in principles and method. And then you make a differentiation between an report that you only submit to us in accordance with Article 152 and this present report you submit in accordance with Article 37 and Article 152, and you tell us that for this reason we need a separate reference to Committee. We also talked to our legal service and the text I quoted you verbally contains precisely this reference to commissionology. This confirms the legal text. In this case this is the head of the committee that he says, we will not remain in our proposal, as has happened in this way in this parliament. Therefore, Mr Byrne, when you tell me to think about it and withdraw it, I would ask you to think about it if you have to agree, since it corresponds to the decision on commissionology. Because then we will have the simplified process. The committee must be highly shown and not the rapporteur! It makes no sense to continue the discussion. Please Mr. Commissioner to answer as soon as possible. I am afraid that what Mr Graefe Zu Baringdorf said reveal a misunderstanding of the subject. First, the agreement reached with the Council on the shortcut of the pedestrian text is something that will be automatically completed under the agreement, as I clarified just before.	el
"This is undoubtedly the result of a complex negotiation in which the two parties have made substantial concessions, which is true for the European Union, particularly in matters of good governance and trade.But it is above all the result of a strengthening of the ACP group, which was clearly a new soul after Seattle.I would like to emphasize that a new way of apprehending these questions seems to me to appear, especially in terms of trade.We must adopt an approach in this area.Finally, we must go further in the development support policies of developing countries.On the financial and budgetary levels, in terms of debt, support for sensitive sectors such as food and humanitarian security or education and health, as well as in the fields of the environment, investment or access to information and new technologies, as in the commercial field, simultaneously ensuring a perfect consistency of development policies with other community policies and also betweenimplemented by the Member States.We cannot content ourselves with continuously pursuing something that has proven to be insufficient and erroneous in the past.Mr. President, after listening to the Council and the Commission today, I absolutely must reread the agenda I have.It is normally a question of ""the coherence of the various policies of the Union with the development policy"".However, we have not heard the slightest word on this subject;I find it very painful.We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.He should have been available in writing today, but after hearing Mr. Nielson's speech, I can imagine very easily that he must face very powerful antagonistic forces within the Commission.I am not aware that the commissioner has particularly clear and very thoughtful opinions in terms of consistency and I would have liked to hear them today.Insofar as the common resolution proposal proposes a number of effective mechanisms in order to guarantee consistency, I will limit myself, given the very short speaking time which has been given to me, to cite one, namely the fact that the Commission should also carry out an evaluation of the new legislation relevant in this area.I would notably like to emphasize the catastrophic consequences that the EU joint agricultural policy for developing countries.I believe that we all know examples: spills of beef in the Sahel and South Africa, tomato purees in West Africa, milk powder in Jamaica.These are things that the producers of ACP countries know at their fingertips - they who must destroy their own products in order to compete with subsidized EU products.The contribution of European taxpayers in order to support European agriculture annually amounts to 40 billion euros.This money helps to hinder the development of the agricultural sector in developing countries where agriculture represents 69 % of the total workforce against 1.7 % within the EU."	fr
"This does not mean that we sympathize with Haider.CSU MEPs do not have the slightest sympathy for Haider, the FPö chief.As politicians, we must rather ask ourselves why 27 % of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPö in the October 1999 elections. We must debate the reasons which president and try to fight the reasons which lead to such results.It is only by debating arguments and the policy of the FPö that we can avoid the radicalization of politics in Austria.On the other hand, the resolution of the European Parliament does not wonder about the foundations of the result of the Austrian ballot and does not advance any potential solution.For these reasons, the European CSU group opposes this resolution..""Because he knew what this joy in joy was unaware of, and that we can read in books, that the bacillus of the plague does not die or never disappears, that he can remain for decades asleep in furniture and linen, which he patiently waits in the rooms, the cellars, the trunks, the handkerchiefs and the paperasses, and that, perhaps, the day, the day and the day,would wake up his rats and send them to die in a happy city ""It is by these sentences that Albert Camus, after a long allegorical story describing the difficult fight of the inhabitants of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the end of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism,"" the brown plague ""as we called it, cannot include a final victory.That racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and refusal of difference, because they plunge their roots into what is most sordid in man, can re -emerge and dominate in any human group at any time.It is in this sense that the events we are witnessing in Austria must be considered tragic.For the first time since the Second World War, an openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic party is at the gates of power in a European country.Faced with this threat, which carries in it the negation of the very idea which is to the curry of European construction, nothing should weigh: neither the legal arguments on what the treaty allows or not, nor the legitimate questions about the right of interference, nor the derisory respect for a formal democracy, and especially not the feeling of helplessness which seizes us before an event that we refuse all the force of our convictions.Elected from a French overseas department, the meeting, the land of interbreeding and mixing, whose population has been forged over the last three centuries by the successive contribution of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, committed from India or Pakistan or Chinese, I have every day the deep truth of the word of Saint-Exupéry: ""If you differ from me, my brother,You get meshed! ""."	fr
But is the Community level the right level for such detailed technical analyzes as those attempted to take place in this directive? Wouldn't it be preferable to make decisions on the permitted levels of pollution for the various substances, the measurement systems, the measurement process and then to use the principle of supplementaryness? Because there are enormous differences in the way waste is processed and in the way waste is incinerated along with large quantities of biological fuels between Northern Scandinavia, where, among other things, distances for transport are large, and the densely populated areas of the central Europe, where the central Europe is a problem, eg. Thermal energy. I would like to discuss - not now, but when we are given the opportunity - for the possibilities of creating a legislative framework in this area. Mr President, I would also like to congratulate Mr Blokland on his report, which will set European standards on incineration, which includes for the first time standards for the broadcast of dioxins and furanons. This will increase the competition between different waste disposal methods, resulting in a contribution to ending the transport of hazardous waste throughout Europe in search of the cheapest waste treatment plants. As an increase in incineration is envisaged, the existence of a coherent and comprehensive overall EU law on waste and the quality of the air is vital. We must consider the whole hierarchy of priorities. Incineration may increase as stricter insanity controls are imposed, but it does not keep up with recycling and with environmentally friendly waste disposal methods. The construction of new incinerators is a costly and long -term venture, which in turn must provide long -term performance for investors, in order to continue to continue the cremation of waste. This means that there is a risk that the ability to incinerate exceed the required by encouraging incineration to profit instead of encouraging the reduction, recycling and safe treatment of waste, which is our goal. The European Parliament must protect the health and quality of life of the people we represent. There is no safe limit for dioxins. At the same time, more research is being carried out on the effects of microparticles on human health and the environment. Therefore, we must ensure that frequent controls and monitoring will be carried out, that there will be regular detailed information to the public and how a real action will be taken in the event of a breach of the rules. Measurement of emissions twice a year can provide timely indication of what is happening in an incineration unit as well as the air breathed by the local community, as opposed to measuring once every two years, which will not provide any such indication. Therefore, we must set as high as possible and not predict exceptions that will weaken this very important legislation. Mr President, one cannot get rid of the waste by throwing them into the sea or launching them into space or even burning them, just so. The substances contained in the waste always return to us, and even more dangerous. Injector can cause diseases, air pollution, climate change and rise of seas level.	el
The melody that will be played will be a melody listened to by the citizens of Europe and they will want to hear the right one.As it was described this afternoon, it will contribute to a large extent to forget the unpleasant melodies that we had heard at the time of the European elections and in the past few months.The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Council develop the project of space of freedom, security and justice.There is one aspect, however, which is very important and in which this parliament must participate, I mean control.The legislation is so abundant - and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Portuguese presidency for its program which was presented to us last week - that we must have absolute certainty that it is closely followed, that deputies in the European Parliament, deputies of national parliaments and European citizens are aware of everything it implies.In addition, we must ensure that it is, in all its details, applicable, appropriate and useful to each of the different countries.I would like to draw attention to certain aspects of the resolutions that are submitted to us this afternoon, one or two of which have already been mentioned before.I congratulate myself on evolution towards the recognition of judicial systems between different countries and towards cropration in criminal matters.European citizens will not remain indifferent to it and they will rejoice.However, the Commission and the Council must know that many deputies in this assembly have reservations to be made, against the Eurodac system for example.We admit the predominant role of the council in this matter, but reservations exist and I am sure that the council will have CUR to listen to what the elected deputies present here have to say when the subject is deepened.Mr. Schulz said he was not sure of the definition to give to the word scoreboard.Any English or British, or whoever follows a cricket match, knows what a scoreboard is.The scoreboard, or display board, gives spectators the score of the match;He must follow the developments, he must be clear and clearly visible.I have no doubt that Commissioner Vitorino will make sure that it is so.I hope that at the end of the six months, music will always play and that citizens will always be attentive.Mr. President, allow me to welcome the President in office and his colleague from the Ministry of Justice, Mr. Costa.I would like to thank them for the welcome they reserved for my committee last week in Lisbon, and for the constructive meetings we had.Amsterdam and Tampere have given us a lot of work to do together, as shown in the excellent resolution project of Ms. Terrón today.I would like to raise three fairly short points.The first is that it is time that we have a thoughtful dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.It has been just six months since the Amsterdam Treaty requires our two organizations to work hand in hand: we gauged ourselves, we had some no -imported beak, but it is now time to work actually together.	fr
"The European Community Initiative aimed at providing free access to the markets of industrialized countries and the most advanced developing countries for all the products coming from the less developed countries began as part of the process that led to the Seattle Conference. This initiative was made shortly after the Singapore conference, when the Council called on the Commission to submit proposals in favor of the less developed countries (LCAs) for both immediate and additional medium -term measures. The Council in its findings in June 1997 states the expression: ""All based on the products of the Lachs"". Regarding the immediate measures, with the Rules of Procedure of the End of 1998, the community introduced a regime equivalent to that of the Lemon Convention for the whole LAX, according to the Council's request. In 1999, in the context of the post-negotiations, the Council clarified, among other things, the actions it intended to take over the market access to the LCO and decided that the community ""would begin in 2000 a process which, at the end of the multilateral trade negotiations and at the latest in 2005, would allow all of its products at the latest, allowing it to access all of its products at the latest,existing commercial status of the Lome Convention. ""The difference between the whole and all ""basically"" the products covers, we know it very well, some special cases of agricultural products. This is the command received by the Commission and therefore, as is quite natural, we respect it. My services are currently preparing the proposals we will present to the Council as soon as they will be completely ready. At the same time, the Community, with its initiative ""less developed countries"" within the WTO, aims to participate in other commercial partners in this opening effort we make and which will be to relieve the LAXs from duties and quotas for all their products. This initiative aims to function in some way as a lever in our own proposal, which, in combination with what we can do with others, will provide the least developed countries the opportunity to channel their products under a regime of almost complete freedom, in a significant number of other markets beyond our own. I am mainly referring to the markets of developed countries: United States, Japan, Australia, New Zealand. I am also thinking of channeling their products to many countries that will be included in the industrialized in the future. At this stage I try to promote this initiative that we have included in the recovery package we are working on in Geneva. So for the immediate future. As the author of the question states, we must wonder if the restriction linked to the expression ""all based on the products"" will be able to be maintained for a long time, as we expect the full access of these countries to our markets. As for the community, following the conclusion of the new agreement with the ACP countries, which no longer includes a commitment to equal access to all ACC countries, we could actually begin to think of a greater liberalization of access to our markets in favor of less developed countries."	el
Nor can we tolerate its arrogance in relation to those who practice Falun Gong and dissidents. In Geneva and elsewhere, the EU must take every opportunity to express its dissatisfaction united. While I strongly support China's entry into the WTO, we have to behave in China in the only way it understands. We need to use these negotiations as through pressure to ensure that China will not only hear EU concerns about constant human rights violations, but also take action to improve its performance. Madam President, dear colleagues, in order to strengthen the protection of human rights in the Union, it is necessary to take care of the most vulnerable, that is, especially the poorest. The first violation of human rights is not to allow everyone to live in dignity. Human respect must guide us, and this respect must lead to not being able to destroy individuals and families, not to separate children from their parents because of misery, not to lack the simple right of those who do not even have a right to work. The aim is to create appropriate living conditions for each citizen. Everyone must be protected from poverty and exclusion. Everyone has the right to education, education, health. Everyone is entitled to a decent housing and an income that allows them to rely on their feet. We must state that we deny misery. We must state that everyone has the right to have their physical and mental integrity and that this integrity depends on the right to a decent life. Could the idea of ​​brotherhood become the dominant concept of the 21st century? The need for dreams remains evergreen in every human being and it is the brotherhood that, today, expresses the essence of our expectations for the benefit of the poorest. It is the brotherhood that gives sense to solidarity, which rejects exclusion and loneliness and which allows for respect for disputes. Brotherhood is the one who must inspire the rights of the poorest. Our century will be a century of progress, a century where the craziest utopias will be implemented. Brotherhood belongs to these utopias and together, dear colleagues, we will do it. Madam President, gentlemen, once again we devote part of plenary work on one of the most noble issues of our parliamentary involvement, on the issue of protecting human rights with every expression and anywhere in the world. Let me congratulate the Bureau on the correct decision he made, to have a joint debate on these four reports. Although we do not really have enough time to devote due to the due importance, it is a fact that when we discuss the state of human rights somewhere far away, there in the outside world, we cannot fail to carry out a serious analysis of what is left here in the European Union. Although we do not, fortunately, find the coarse violations that occur in other states and justifiably concerned, it does not cease to be a fact that in our own Member States, we must also promote the further respect of these rights, economic and social rights, civil rights and social rights. Personal data, in the rights of children and women, as well as in the rights of economic refugees.	el
Second, we must see what are the capacities of each country, so that this overall force of 60,000 soldiers can be distributed in an orderly and effective manner between the fifteen countries.Tertio, we must see what are the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can bring.It is possible, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not have enough capacities in the fifteen countries and that the latter must all make an additional effort to deal with the needs that we have offered.How are we going to do?We want to do so by summoning a conference of the fifteen countries to see the differences between the objectives set and the means we have to achieve them and see how what we are missing is distributed between the fifteen countries that form the European Union.Ladies and Gentlemen, Madam President, we want to fix the calendar so that, during the French Presidency, in December 2000, we can close this process by a large conference generating forces of all countries so that needs and capacities are equivalent and that we can therefore sincerely say that we already have the plan of what we have to do from the end of 2000 to 2003decided that the capacities will be underway.Ladies and gentlemen, that is what we do, to which we are committed to.I believe that we have worked well in recent months, in recent weeks and I think that we will be able to work during what remains of the year 2000 during the Portuguese presidency - which really does extraordinary, magnificent work - and continue during the French presidency which, without any doubt, will continue to work with the same promptitude and the same capacity as that which it has shown on other occasions.I wanted to tell you that in the meantime, there will be at least four European advice, that of Lisbon, that of Feria and two European councils during the French presidency.During these councils, the heads of state and government are also ready to pursue the examination of these questions so that we do not reject the train and that we are able, by 2003, to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.Consequently, Ladies and Gentlemen, Madam President, I think that in this area, we work with determination, energy and with the broad support of all governments and all heads of state and government.Ladies and gentlemen, I would still like to add two things.The European Union has the obligation to carry out all this operation by keeping contact with the third countries to which I have referred, countries which, although members of Europe from a geographic point of view, are not yet part of the European Union.These are countries with which we must work, which we must integrate because, if a crisis occurs, God keeps us, all the forces and all the countries will be more than welcome.Then we must be able to establish a fluid and transparent relationship with NATO.The operations that we will have to carry out in the future will be of three types: the first takes up the operations in which European forces participate in the context of NATO;The second takes up the operations in which European forces participate and which they direct, but using NATO's means and infrastructure;The third takes up the operations where Europeans will act alone.	fr
"Strongly concerned about the continuation of human rights violations in Tibet and in order to support the proposal of the Dalai Lama aimed at establishing a dialogue with the Chinese government in order to resolve the Tibetan situation, the inter-group working group ""Tibet"" therefore asks the commission to appoint a delegate for Tibetan affairs, who will take care of the European Union,will strive to bring the Tibetan, Chinese authorities or their representatives to start a dialogue.When does the commission intend to name this Tibetan affairs delegate?The floor is to Mr. Patten, on behalf of the Commission.The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.I have long believed in the need to clearly and sincerely expose our points of view on human rights, including in Tibet, to the Chinese authorities.This is what the European Union did last month, at the European Union-China summit in Beijing, during which we have exerted pressures with the Chinese on a series of questions relating to human rights, including in Tibet.Once again, we invited the Chinese to start a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.Once again, I invite the Chinese to do so.We will continue to raise the question of Tibet with the Chinese authorities.We also undertake other actions: during the dialogue between the European Union and China on Human rights, we focused on a series of practical measures, including the sending of mission experts to Tibet, planning development assistance programs and activities relating to health, education and training for Tibetans.It is to the council that the appointment of an EU special envoy would mainly return to Tibet and the European Parliament could tackle the issue directly with him.As far as I'm concerned, I am not sure that our efforts would gain a lot from a practical point of view.It is unlikely that it will have a great impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective communication channels with the Tibetan community in exile.I would also like to avoid an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, whatever commendable.Mr. President, Mr. Patten, of course you benefit from an excellent experience of China because of your journey and you most certainly know how the Tibetans are trying to obtain the implementation of dialogues, which have all been avoided so far.If your answer is limited to telling us to send us to Mr. PESC, to Mr. Solana, I fear that it is a unilateral orientation in terms of foreign policy.Your approach, which I gladly recommend for its consistency, is inspired by the theme of human rights.I totally agree: we must take care of the theme of human rights.Detention, torture, mutilation of young women and other similar practices are all themes of discussion quite endless.If we reduce all this to say that the Council is competent in these matters, I fear that the questions relating to human rights do not come enough in the foreground.The possibility of insisting on the one hand on the economy and trade while including the issue of human rights would be a measure for which we would actually be able to tell the partnership of the European Commission and would not say that this is the case of the Council."	fr
Therefore, I support Mr. Swoboda's well -founded report - we are not used to anything else - and therefore also my appreciative words about the respectable Republic of Macedonia.Mr. President, revered colleagues, allow me to pronounce my personal recognition for the quality of his work, the rapporteur, Mr. Swoboda.Today we make an advisable statement on the initiation of negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.We do this in the consciousness that this decision, the first ever that refers to this region, is specified in a completely new phase of our relationships with the Balkans.He himself is a factor of this new phase or a policy that sees the only way to solve your conflicts in the future integration of this region into the European Union.Our approval of the negotiations, as proposed in the justification of the rapporteur, is based on our conviction that it is correct to combine both a regional dimension in the Union politics and the specific appreciation of the efforts and results of the individual member states in the alignment with each other.In my opinion, this double objective must be pursued.Therefore, on the one hand, the programs related to the infrastructures, for example, must be prepared for the creation of a free trade zone - for which it is still too early - and forms of economic and commercial cooperation between the Balkan countries, and on the other hand, it is time to create a model for a narrower integration policy with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.For various reasons, we cannot avoid a positive statement.As we found in the framework of our missions in Skopje, in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, the progress in the economic sector, on the way to democracy and on the - in the Balkans region - quite difficult and conflicting - area of ​​living together between different ethnic groups are remarkable;On the other hand, a high price was paid for the war in neighboring Kosovo, both by providing logistics for the NATO forces and the falling exports to Northern Europe.In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that these developments are undoubtedly difficult, inconsistent and insecure and that we demand constant vigilance in relation to the various stages that must be expressed through regular and targeted checks.President, Mr. Commissioner, revered colleagues!At this point I would like to express that negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are welcomed by the faction of the liberals, the Democrats and the reformers of Europe.I have the strong hope that this agreement may serve as an example in its basic features in his rapporteur, Mr. Swoboda, and as soon as possible to other countries, especially in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and as soon as possible is also extended to Serbia.According to our conviction, a rapid introduction to these negotiations and their rapid conclusion are the only way to create peace in the region - those peace that has not automatically occurred since the end of the war in Kosovo - and thus prevent conditions for further decay again and that chaos and violence will be used again, which leads to instability in Europe, if not in the world.	de
That the public accepts such prices without abandoning financial operations in panic can be explained by the too optimistic expectation of future profits.Speculative activities develop beyond any measure and in turn feed profits which, one day, will prove to be fictitious.Excessive optimism will succeed disenchantment and fear, with the consequence of a stock market crisis and, possibly, an economic crisis.The risk is too large for you to ignore it.We have to face it, even if it seems difficult.Modern economic science has given us a remarkable tool with the proposal of Tobin and others that we could use if we had the political will to start acting.This is what we miss, Mr. Commissioner, the political will to start attacking speculation.But the blissful admiration or resignation in the face of market forces, the professions of faith of the Liberals - and I regret that Mr. Gasòliba I Böhm no longer sits among us - cannot continue indefinitely to characterize democracy, because they lead us straight for the disaster!Madam President, Mr. Bolkestein, it is quite incredible to see how ignorance permeates this discussion.It was necessary for a Greek colleague to tell us what this Tobin tax meant.You refuse it without any other form of trial because you do not understand anything.It is perfectly clear that the right is opposed to taxes;Otherwise, it would never have dared to transfer these millions, even these billions, to Switzerland.It has become clear.Now, I am calling you - with full knowledge of the facts - to help stop speculative financial capital, to finally support long -term projects by long -term capital.This has never been done in Southeast Asia, it has never been done in Europe and, to consider their financial management, I can understand that our Austrian Karas colleague is no longer there.It's the same mess.We need a Tobin tax to be able to intervene via a tax instrument.Madam President, I am revolted with the political ignorance of this commission, that is to say Commissioner Bolkestein.Given his position on the Tobin tax, he should really wonder why he is here.Madam President, I too had the impression of a ghostly debate somewhat.It is undoubtedly no coincidence that no preservatives be present because the idea of ​​market freedom they defended has nothing to do with the august principles of the social market economy which have brought so much prosperity to Western Europe in recent decades.If we continue to assert the sacrosanct nature of the markets - such is the ideology - and even to maintain that any intervention in the functioning of these markets is opposed to the progress and the growth of the economy, we most certainly be wrong and this can take very dangerous proportions.Currently, capital holders still have colossal fortunes that are asking to be reinvested.	fr
I would like everything to do much faster. It is preferable to do them in the absolutely appropriate way. Verts/ale).(NL) Madam President, we admire Mr Kinnock's vision and realistic approach. This is because while it is presented with the vision of an effective administration that is working properly, it is at the same time drawing our attention to the difficulties that can arise, difficulties that are already on the horizon. Mr Prodi said he wants to resign from certain responsibilities. Political priorities should therefore be set. I believe that it is more important to decide first of all what the European Union wants to do before it is decided on what tasks to resign, otherwise I am afraid that there will be many reactions as many. In this context, enlargement is one of the great challenges, the enlargement of the union I mean. I would like to emphasize at this point that maintaining peace will require much more intense efforts, in which many more people will have to participate. The relatively bureaucratic approach, which we know at this time in areas such as development cooperation, should be decisively converted into a cooperation for peace. Could Mr Kinnock tell us what awaits the Council and the parliament in terms of timetable for setting these priorities? I am grateful to Mrs. Maes, not only for the comments she made now, but also for the constant dedication she has shown to the changes since she came to this body. I can assure her that our attitude is not guided by any kind of incentive to assign our obligations to others. We focus on basic duties and focus on priorities, not in order to avoid any obligations, but to guarantee the fullest that we can fully fulfill our basic obligations. Clearly, one of these obligations - and at this point I totally agree with Mrs Maes - is the preparation of an effective, smooth, calm enlargement that will be mutually functioning for both the people of the incoming countries and the citizens of the current Union. One of the reasons we need to ensure our very strong and intense focus on our priorities is to be able to guarantee that we are able to fulfill this completely decisive role, to be fully effective enlargement factors. I can tell her that the mechanisms we are going to establish for strategic planning and planning, by facilitating management based on activities, may sound extremely dry and completely deprived of any idealism. As I was raised, believing that the victory of the ideals needs an organization, I may be called upon to understand and support our mechanistic view of it, because it concerns the great and central goals of its Union and its enlargement. I hope that in terms of the degree of cooperation and partnerships that we can enjoy in all aspects of this policy with the Council and Parliament, we will not only have a rapid implementation of politics growth in the most effective way, but we can do so tuned at the right time, which will bring it to the best.	el
Culture is at the heart of our democratic views;And non -civilized society does not allow tolerance, freedom, or democracy. Cultural diversity is important, but it is threatened. However, it is not threatened by Europe. Many people in my country say that they believe that British culture is threatened by, for example, Portugal, Germany and Finland - the sky. We drink port wine and like German beer and even go to Finnish saunas, but culture is not threatened by Europe. Instead, I see people all over Europe drink Coca Cola, eat burgers, use baseball laws and watch Hollywood movies-and often they do all this at the same time. I do not think that protectionism and regulation would be a way of defending European culture, but we think we have to give a helping hand as possible. This is the case with the Culture 2000 program. I would say to the Council of Ministers: Really keep an eye on this program. Do we do enough? And I say to the Commission member Reding: Thanks for your support and the help you've given us so far, continue in the same pattern, we are by your side. Mr President, I, too, would like to thank the rapporteur Gra Moura and Commission member Reding for their contribution to this program. The Culture 2000 program got its final form at the end of last year in mediation between Parliament and the Council. The end result can be considered reasonable, given that the approval of the program required a unanimous decision in the Council. It is desirable that the upcoming HVK will also end up in the majority of culture. It is really special that legislation, which is being handled, requires a consensus in the Council. The cultural framework program will replace current Kaleidoscope, Ariane and Rafael programs. When the program begins to be implemented, I particularly hope that its opportunities for literature and translation of books can be fully utilized. I believe and hope that despite the rush of new technology, literature retains its position. We need the deepening of literature in the midst of short -term and superficiality. Literature also plays a major role in conveying our cultural heritage, increasing mutual knowledge, and nurturing linguistic richness and diversity. In this context, it is particularly pleased that soon after the Socrates and Culture 2000 programs are officially launched at a meeting of the Ministerial Council in Lisbon, the EU Presidency State will hold a meeting of public libraries. I hope that this meeting also encourages the Commission to actively consider libraries in the fifth framework program of the information society. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, a Mr Media Reporter, Good Members of the Parliament, the circle of today's agenda closes in a way. Today, we have talked a lot about Europe as a community of values, tolerance, human dignity, human rights, a positive attitude towards the expansion process, and openness and mutual respect. Youth, education and cultural policies are important tools in creating these values, citizens' confidence in the European Union and the credibility of the European Union in relation to citizens. The appropriations granted to the Cultural Program for the Cultural Program are in a blatant contradiction with the importance of cultural and education policy and the importance of this program for the European Union's objectives. Cultural activities create identity. Cultural activities are an expression of individuality and one's personality, and creates relationships and communicates. We want a colorful Europe. We want Europe in line with the principle of unity diversity. We want people to understand and learn to appreciate diversity. For this reason, we have been in favor of opening the budget or allocating appropriations into different measures. For this reason, we have rejected the biggest focus on networks and network structures because we want to support small and medium -sized units and individual activities, we want to give thousands of flowers flowers. I would like to give my support to the previous speaker. There is a contradiction - the principle of unanimity, the joint decision and the mediation committee - when we want to strengthen the principles of cultural policy in European consciousness and do not continue to weaken them.	fi
"The duration of the regulation: In order to avoid a placement procedure, the Commission rejects change application 12 and the proposal of an unlimited validity of the regulations.In our view, the seven -year period of validity proposed by the Council is an acceptable compromise.Bank guarantees: For the reasons already mentioned, the Commission rejects change application 8 in relation to bank guarantees.We reject special provisions in certain household lines because this contradicts our common goal of simplifying and standardizing our administrative procedures.In addition, due to a decision that was made by the Commission in 1999, we are of the opinion that this topic has been essentially clarified.As far as the other amendments are concerned, we represent the following position: The Commission welcomes and supports the amendments 7 and 10.We reject change applications 2, 3 and 6 because we believe that the underlying concepts have already been taken into account in the regulation after the first reading in other places.In the interest of a clear and concise legal regulation, we should refrain from these amendments.Change application 1 is not supported because, in our view, hardly anything is added.In view of the negative opinion of the Council on this amendment, the Commission also speaks for its deletion.Finally, we reject amendment 5 because we consider the wording ""serious doubts"" to be too subjective and fear that this could make the implementation of the regulation very difficult.In addition, the aim of this amendment, namely the avoidance of projects with negative social, cultural or economic effects as well as negative consequences for the environment is already taken into account in Article 4 paragraph 5 of compatibility tests.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Nielson!The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Ship waste and load residues Now, colleague Jarzembowski, follows the great moment!According to the agenda, the recommendation for the second reading (A5-0043/2000) by Mr. Bouwman follows on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the joint position of the Council with regard to the enactment of the directive of the European Parliament and the Council on Hafenfägfängerungs for ship waste and load residues.President, Ms. Commissioner!Today we treat a guideline that is necessary, even bitter.In the past few weeks we have talked about Erika's accident.It was also about suggestions for various new, short -term measures such as double -walled fuselage, controls, monitoring of inspection organs and so on.The oil pollution of the sea caused by such disasters is about 3 %.A percentage of twice as high is due to normal ship operations.But that's not all.In the Netherlands, for example, but also in other countries, 49 % of the unrest are washed off directly from the sea on our beaches.The tourists only have 15 %, while a large part of even unknown and not precisely localized origin is.In view of the enormous economic damage, in view of the qualitative impairment of the habitats very important for seabirds, fish and other living beings, in short, since it is about our environment, the present directive is an urgent need. I need nothing to say about the reasons for this guideline."	de
In addition, there is a lack of transparency.Everything is done to let the chain of responsibilities, the identity of the owners and the true decision -makers in the dark as far as possible.This is no longer acceptable.In all of these areas, we have to achieve real and significant changes, including the determination of a key date for the new standards, which also includes the double outer skin, otherwise there is a ban on entering in the ports or a driving ban in the territorial waters of the Member States.In addition, we have to ensure that rigoroser is carried out at the exhibition of sea level tests and in the monitoring of the condition and the maintenance of the ships.Finally, it must be ensured that in the event of a catastrophe, all responsible persons are used for compensation benefits.In the present case, I think especially of the Total Fina group.The European Union can also represent the same ideas compared to the international maritime shipping organization.In this time, she would have demonstrated its benefits in the eyes of a public who expected clear and concrete actions.President, Ms. Commissioner!As a member of the French Atlantic coast from the Vendée department, I would first like to express the outrage that the population affected by the tanker Erika's oil spill feels in view of the devastating consequences that were not triggered by a natural disaster like the hurricane that also affected us, but by a crime.In the hour of need there was a wonderful wave of solidarity: at local, national and cross -border level.Now the affected population, those people who have lost everything, especially the professional groups who have been questioned from the sea and the tourism and their activity not only expect the causes to make the damage, but that everything will be done in order to teach from their current misfortune so that no other crimes will not become victims tomorrow.We now pay the price for our omissions.Because our states with the blessing of the community no longer thought it was useful to entertain their own merchant fleet, and it allowed that valuable know -how in the field of shipbuilding were lost, we no longer have a clear traceability of the ships and have to see how our waters of scrap are used to use the short -term interests of the multinational societies.This chain of irresponsibility from irresponsible teachers to unable to be found to be found to delicate certification companies must be put an end.We are in a difficult situation today.Of course, these things have to be regulated worldwide, but the current rules of the IMO are extremely inadequate and far too lax, and despite the previous disasters, neither our countries nor the community have seriously tried to make them strictly.Certainly there is the international fund against the environmental damage from mineral oils (FIPOL), but here the responsibilities are blurred, and the upper limit of the fund for compensation is absolutely inadequate and urgently needs the change.The question of the pleasure flags must be checked as part of the IMO.It is up to the Member States and the community to take the initiative for this.Let me remember that the Erika drove under the pleasure flag of a state that is the candidate for accession for the EU.	de
If these funds make it possible to remove delays from regions, cities and population groups or if health and the environment are improved, my group is satisfied.It is a question of solidarity and progress.But the fact that we always allocate more money does not guarantee that expenses improve accordingly.The cities and regions which benefit from funds have in the meantime acquired experience in the field.They find that it is extremely difficult to spend money on the objectives for which they need it most.The results are generally good with regard to economic growth and infrastructure, but social objectives and the environment are not always approved.As there is a great uncertainty concerning the way in which the rules are exposed, the municipalities and the regions spend fortunes to rent the services of expert offices which are responsible for assessing to what extent the officials of the European Commission are ready to approve their plans.In some cases, I have the impression that it is not a question of solidarity or to solve the most burning problems, but to maintain in place interests and propaganda in favor of the benefits of the European Union.It seems that the main objective is now to build and paint a propaganda panel on which the project is in question is co -financed by the European Union.Far too many funds are wasted in propaganda and design offices, in consultation and control and far too many funds return to the country from which they come.After the membership of new Member States, and their 100 million inhabitants whose standard of living reaches a third or two -thirds of the average of the current Member States of the European Union, this waste will arouse even more objections.Within the regional policy, transport and tourism policy, the unitary left group agreed with the rapporteur for opinion on leader, Mr. Nogueira Román.It is right that he found that it is not good to disperse these funds on all rural areas.Between innovation projects and the concentration of funds on the fight against delays, we opt for the latter objective because it contributes more to equality.Innovation in regions where it is already going well is already profitable and intervenes, even without European contribution.A second point which should be taken care of is the abuse of power and the cronyism policy whose regional and municipal administrations can be guilty.Emphasis is placed on local groups in which the authorities, non -profit organizations and for -profit companies cooperate.The discussion focused on the distribution key to be used.In particular, a variant was discussed which reminds of the Dutch polders model, structural cooperation organized between authorities, unions and entrepreneurs.Let us not forget that the elections of municipal councils and regional parliaments aim to represent the entire population.In fact, it would be that these bodies carry out an examination and that they take into account the wishes of sectoral organizations and ecological movements.	fr
"Another approach is that we re -introduce the right of the Ex Nihilo principle, that is, we harmonize the legal systems and reform the legal systems and concepts of all Member States. We have not started for that above. The third way to act - which we have applied - is that the existing systems that we do not intend to change are finally ""germinated"" for real community legislation for common procedures and difficulty in difficulty. Besides, this would be a positive thing, and its results are even exceeding expectations. However, at this point, I wish I could make a attention that is not technical, but rather philosophical and practical. Most Member States of the European Union consider insolvency to be very ultimate for those who have to experience it. In my opinion, our responsibility is the opportunity to set up commercial companies several times if the need arises. This is not possible today in many Member States. Indeed, the differences between the European region and the US competitiveness, for example, are explained by the flexibility that is found on the other side of the ocean, but which we Europeans do not have. As we have gone so far, and if we continue on the path of our choice - which is supposed to lead to the creation of the common and consistent solution procedures of this type of controversy in the European Union - I think we must strive to ensure that this procedure will not become symbolic of the guillotine. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, Good Friends, I really think that happiness than skill has saved us so far from catastrophes, even though we miss the rules that previous speakers have mentioned. When we access the good of the internal market, that is, to create such an internal market, we also have to access the downside to the downside, namely bankruptcies. In my opinion, we live in historical moments. I congratulate the rapporteur for having done such a quick job on the report. In addition, I am proud that my home country has been involved in drawing up this regulation, which we hope to accept the Council soon. I consider this an important step, even though it has little effect on the national system. Unfortunately, the rapporteur is unfortunately stated that our group cannot support the revision 3. We believe that it restricts the legal status and legal protection of citizens. In the review 6, I can say that we will prepare a similar review in the committee proceedings. I'm a little amazed that you did not support it in the PSE group at that time. We are now supporting the review of 6, but as I said, I am amazed at why you do not support our review in the committee. I also hope that the transparency of this issue will be realized and that we get a comparison of which procedures are the fastest and best in different states..(PT) Mr President, Memorable Members of the Parliament, first, would like to emphasize that the proposal for the regulation to be discussed tonight is only and, above all, re -designing the Convention on the 1995 insolvency proceedings. Everyone knows that this Convention was the result of often very difficult and laborious debates for many years, and for this reason it is a compromise between unique and regional principles, that is, in other words, the structural principles of the various bankruptcy systems in each Member State. The awareness that the development of the world economy, and in particular the internal market, may require more frequent resort to insolvency procedures that are often curtained to bordering procedures, fully justifies that the Union, as a Federation, has two necessary legal lawsGive guarantees for rapid implementation. Fortunately, or unfortunately, the fact that companies are leaving bankruptcy, there is an increasingly common element in our everyday economy."	fi
"That is why the institutions of the European Union have developed a comprehensive negotiating and consultation activity in the Amsterdam contract after taking the declaration No. 31, which ultimately culminated in the new decision of the Council, with which the old system is largely changed, but not satisfactorily changed for us.In particular, a check right of the parliament, i.e.h.The possibility introduced to ""ring the alarm bell"" if a measure to carry out a legal act issued according to the co -decision procedure violates the authorization authority transferred to the Commission.In the course of the lengthy interinstitutional negotiations, in which the parliament was actively involved thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Ms. Adelaide Aglietta, the goal was to conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the modalities of the application of certain aspects of the new decision.On the one hand, in order to clarify certain points that the Council was not willing to include in the decision, and on the other hand to regulate the information and control system with regard to the implementation measures more precisely.As part of the trilogue of October 6, 1999 in Strasbourg, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission approved the proposal to conclude this agreement quickly.We believe that we have complied with this obligation, which, however, was relatively easy for us, since there was a climate of trust and mutual respect during the entire negotiation with the Commission.In the agreement, two points are essentially dealt with: On the one hand, this is the inform of the European Parliament as a conditio sine qua non for the actual exercise of his right of intervention in accordance with Article 8 of the decision.This information has so far been carried out on paper and unsystematically and was often unusable for our services, partly also by the guilt of the parliament itself.From now on, this information is ensured by an electronic system with the name Circa, to which the European Parliament has access and not only for us, but also - I am sure - is a real innovation for the commission.On the other hand, in Article 8 of the Council decision neither the procedure nor the deadline are mentioned, within which the European Parliament ""ring"" alarm bells, i.h.must exercise its limited control authority.In point 6 and 7 of the agreement it is stated that the European Parliament generally accepts its resolution in the plenum and has a period of one month to make use of its right to intervention before the commission's draft.However, we are all aware that it is not always possible to wait a month before a implementation measure is issued.Therefore, an urgency procedure is expressly provided for in the agreement, in the context of which the responsible committee can work.Finally, I would like to emphasize that we have to wait and see how the agreement works in practice before we can assess whether it is a good agreement or not.The European Parliament will have to equip itself with it not yet available in order to ensure an effective course of the implementing methods and effective control, and the commission will have to accept a reorganization of some of its procedures in order to ensure effective control and an actual information of parliament."	de
In the group of the People's Party there is no clear agreement on the question of supporting the mandatory quota regulation.Some members even speak against it.Personally, I don't want to feel a quota, I don't want to think that I am only on a certain position because I was born as a woman.This is a feeling that the men will never have, and an essential difference.I would also like to thank the minister and the commission member for their contributions, and I agree with the latter that it is time that beautiful words are converted into action.We all know how small the proportion of women in decision -making is at all levels, because we know the statistics, and they speak volumes.I agree that precise statistics are also necessary, because we will only learn from the fact that we slowly overcome the problems when we see how the numbers change.We will be able to recognize this with systematic monitoring.Mainstreaming is a long -term obligation.In the meantime we need positive measures, which means that we use odds and similar measures.We can learn from the mentioned successes, and not only by looking at the actual number of female MPs, but also on the effects they had on the government composition to clarify that everyone benefits from a really representative system.I am pleased that the proportion of women in the National Assembly in Wales, which I represent, is 40 %.That is the result of positive measures by the political parties;On the other hand, only four women from Wales are represented in the lower house, which is just 10 % of all MPs.Therefore, fundamental statements and basic support are not enough because they do not work.If we trust in the principle of equal representation of women and men in the decision structures, we have to participate in the measures that are necessary for its implementation.President!At the second international socialist women's conference in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided to combine the main claim to combine voting rights for women with the entire question of women.In addition, as noted in the resolution, the women's day should be preserved and well prepared.It is also noteworthy that Women's Day was later banned in all countries in which fascism and racism came to power and between the wars.In 1910 the right to vote for women was on the agenda.Nowadays we focus on participating more women in the decision -making processes.Women are not a homogeneous group.They belong to different social classes, have different individual needs and interests.In general and continuously, however, regardless of where we are, regardless of class, breed or religion, whether at home or at work, we are subordinate to men in all areas of society - with a few individual exceptions, you should probably add.In my home country, Sweden, several political parties have voluntarily introduced a quota regulation for the election to political committees and the occupation of political offices in recent years.This has led to an increasing number of women in political decision -making, which in turn opened new opportunities for research.	de
"At that time, most of the waste was biodegradable, which we are far from today. We talked about the chocolate. So here's a practical way to give a clear picture of the issue, following, for example, the course of the packaging of a chocolate, from the trash can at the incineration factory, where we discover that the burning of the foil produces toxic gases. In terms of waste management, we are facing a very important challenge. I believe, however, that some countries are not prepared for her neither materials nor spiritual. Today, the French Management Center is processing one -third of home and other similar waste with the help of three hundred incinerators. The incineration emits pollutants: drystick, minerals and dioxins that need to limit it thanks to a tobacco treatment system. The regulation concerning the reduction of waste is gradually enhanced. Of course, some actions are necessary to make the rules respected, because we need to protect health and the environment, however, in terms of co -operation, we do not want to modify the scope or the definition of its facilities. We must pay attention, if we consolidate some of these regulations and if we complicate others, do not cause mistrust of European environmental law, which recommends something else, sinking certain professions and industries in uncertainty. On the other hand, there is a risk by changing the legislation in force in the case of co -operation units or the special treatment of hazardous waste, to cause a distortion of the price, or an unjustified ""tourism"" of waste. There is a real danger, may we favor one sector or the other at the expense of the rest through marginal values ​​that we will not adjust properly, while we need four areas of incineration \ u903 \ '3f the sector specializing in dangerous waste, the one specializing in non -hazardous waste. I draw the attention of my colleagues to another point, which is definitely a secondary. Nevertheless, in my opinion, a communication task is necessary after the merger of these instructions. In fact, people have the impression that especially waste, dangerous, non -dangerous, urban, will all be a mixture together and undergo a common treatment, in the same furnace, in the same facility. Therefore, at this level the choice of waste should be useless. Therefore a real information and explanation work is needed. Davies report (A5-0062/2000) In this debate on air quality, we negotiate, through the Davies report, the problem of ozone in the air. All experts agree: It is necessary to increase air quality standards so that citizens throughout the European Union are effectively protected by the dangers of the presence of ozone in the air. The effects of ozone on health are varied: eye irritation, nose and throat, thoracic discomfort, cough and headaches, etc. Ozone also contributes to asthma crisis, fading of pulmonary function and increasing bronchial reaction. In the long run, it can even cause premature aging of the lungs. This finding is at least frightening, which is why I welcome this Directive proposal with great satisfaction! It is indeed aimed at amending the existing Community legislation on ozone, in accordance with the requirements of Directive 96/62/EC of the Council on the assessment and management of the quality of the air."	el
Alcohol is also the main factor in causing accidents on European roads as well as a very essential factor in serious accidents. I find that the committee's view of setting a low alcohol limit for drivers is very correct because safety and alcohol are not compatible. From the experiences of those countries with a low maximum limit we know that this helps to reduce the number of dead as well as serious accidents. I would like to put a question to the Commissioner. Why would it be impossible to issue a directive in this area, when in most countries the maximum threshold is now at 0.5 mg and in just a few exceeds 0.5 mg? Es) As you highly highlighted, the Honorable Lady, there are about 10,000 deaths recorded every year on European streets and related to excessive alcohol consumption. The majority of countries are in line at 0.5 mg. The 0.8 mg threshold is only valid in Ireland, Luxembourg, Italy and the United Kingdom, while a threshold below 0.5 mg only exists in Sweden. What we are going to do is present a notice of road safety, which will soon be received by Parliament, and propose a maximum of 0.5 mg. We understand that we must keep legislation on cases where it is absolutely necessary to legislate. We realize that, since there are few Member States that have set a limit of more than 0.5 mg, this recommendation will be enough for these Member States to harmonize their laws. We believe that the supplementary and composition will be enough for the level of alcohol in the various states to set at 0.5 mg or below 0.5 mg. Since we are talking about blood alcohol levels, I wonder if the Commissioner is considering his recommendation and the broader issue of drugs. This is an important issue that is often ignored when driving. Will this issue be included in the recommendation? The point is obviously that drugs cause situations that clearly limit the ability to react drivers. The problem with drugs is that, while in some countries their consumption may entail criminal prosecution, in others this is not the case, and therefore, given these characteristics and this different treatment, we cannot, at least for the time, proceed to this field. Nevertheless, it is an issue that concerns me, as it is of your concern, and I would like to see if in the new frameworks of action, and in particular in the context of new sectors of community policies we will be able to continue progress in this area. Finally, I must add that in the case of drugs the control is more difficult, since control systems are not so automatically or as directly as in the case of alcohol. Question No.63 by K. (H -0164/00): Subject: Verona - Munich Rail Connection The study for a new Verona railway line with Munich has been discussed for years. Traffic on the Verona-Monahach axis is increasing, but today's rail line is used only at 1/3 of its potential.	el
And, in summary, I would say, what I have restored as more important than you said, this is that first of all you wanted to remind us that beyond its economic aspects, European construction is a spiritual work. We wish, of course, with all our hearts, to continue this work with you. Thank you, Mr President.(The solemn meeting ends at 12.40) Assembly of equal ACE-EOK representation. The agenda provides for the debate on Mr Corrie's report (A5-0032/2000), on behalf of the Committee on Development and Cooperation, on the results of the work of the ASE ASE representation assembly in 1999. De) Mr President, I would first of all congratulate his colleague Corrie and his extensive report. Respect for human rights and the fight against poverty must be the basis of any rationale for development policy. As for the purpose of combating poverty, to reduce funds for growth assistance in many Member States and in the EU it is in great contradiction with it. In terms of funding, in the future, in the future, the assembly of equal representation with complementary resources to give eg. The possibility of sending observers to elections at the request of the ACP countries. In the future, the EU must have in the future selection of development plans on the one hand, on the one hand, on the one hand, on the other hand, on the other hand, it can be better consistent with the individual states in order to make the work and resources more effective. An example of this is the field of education, which must and deserve to be given in the future of special support. Considering the rapid development of the possibilities offered in the Internet education and technology, you see that there are completely new auxiliary means to approach developing countries, which now still have limited means, not globalization, but in globalism. Here I can see an EU's future mission, that is, to contribute to the creation of a middle class in the ACP countries, which can act as an assistant to help themselves help themselves. One can consider the problem that appears in Nigeria, where ready -made industrial products from around the world have been introduced, but their maintenance is done by foreign craftsmen and is costly. Proper training of the Nigerian population could show the way to creating a middle class. Future optimization of working methods, which has been clearly stated in the report and is essentially necessary, will make it possible to better address the varied, specific problems of developing countries, especially through the planned regional sessions, and the relevant assistance of the EU can be prepared.. Thank you, Mr. Zimmerling: If I understood well, this is the first time you take the word in the body. This is your maiden speech and I would like to congratulate you on it. You did very well. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, no matter how many times it is repeated, there are few: the L. Convention has been a substantial pillar of European development cooperation since 1975 and its operation is in many ways pilot. It is a global model thanks to the principle of partnership and equality, as well as the parliamentary monitoring of the Assembly of equal representation.	el
The summit of Lisbon starts with this inheritance and must develop it in those aspects in which it has not yet been consolidated, and that are not a few because we do not yet have a uniform internal market in the areas we want to advance in Lisbon: due to delays, there is no uniform internal market, for example, in public and private services or in the use of modern technologies, for the markets with regard to the informationAnd thus to really complete efficiency.Here the necessary increase in productivity must now be set in order to achieve long -lasting economic development without inflation.However, we have to be careful.Perhaps we dismember this debate about Lisbon, but we always have to keep an extremely precise goal in mind: We have to create the economic and social conditions for sustainable growth.We have already mentioned the economic conditions, namely efficiency and productivity;The social conditions are about avoiding fragmentation and income gap in our society - one of the greatest dangers.I emphasize again, because we should be commemorating: The income gap has been increasing in Europe recently.If not today, this problem will be insoluble tomorrow.This results in both the responsibility of the market and public responsibility.In Lisbon we have to make some very concrete decisions.I would like to point out a special aspect, since referring to the United States in various ways.In the United States, this new market, this innovation and its distribution - the huge leap forwards are that this is an innovation, namely in the telematics area, by which knowledge is also carried into the outskirts - by no means owe only the private initiative.Extensive public investments were made, federal, national and local level.Enormous sums were invested in modern infrastructure.Attention, in this regard, our immediate - I repeat, immediate - commitment on the public level and the other levels in the telematics compounds, i.h.to set up the paths for these new information carriers.The market, the private individuals, companies will provide the carriers while we are obliged to create the new data highways.Therefore, the obligation mentioned by Prime Minister Guterres can not only be left to the market for the equipment of all schools with computers and to the network extending to the outskirts, because the market will simply not do so, and on the other hand, we will not achieve the new, necessary productivity goals without these measures.We therefore have to avoid that the peripheral economic sectors get into a crisis, which in no way means centralization or centralized planning, but it means that we open up the same opportunities for the peripheral economy as the centralized economy.For this reason, the program must be geared towards the schools, so we have to take on an entire age group and penetrate it, stand up to ensure that there is no longer a single age group that is not captured by this new literacy.There is therefore a precise strategy for Lisbon.In Lisbon, in my opinion, it is mainly about sowing new courage for employment and growth, in the consciousness that we are able to do so;So we have to move to this model, which is based on safe equilibriums.	de
I would like to go into a chapter that seems to me to be a bit incomplete that of social policy.That would not be that bad if considerable progress had been made in the past five years, but this is not the case.In the area of ​​social policy, however, the Commission and Parliament have the opportunity to move a lot.I think in particular here in Chapter 1 of Title XI of the Treaty and especially the question of working conditions and the improvement of the work environment.With regard to the health protection and the security of the employees, a guideline from 1989 is currently valid. In my opinion, and in the opinion of my faction, this guideline should be checked in particular on the basis of a comprehensive investigation published by Dublin in 1997.In this study, a general deterioration in working conditions is found in a number of important areas.This should be considered and I would like the commission to seriously deal with this matter and determine how this directive must be changed to improve the situation.I do not want to go into the details in terms of content, but something with the processes in the context of the legislative program, i.e.h.deal with the presentation of the program and its implementation.To do this, I would like to present two emphatic demands of the Greens' faction, of which I would have liked to adopt the parliament.But today they should only be expressed here as emphatic claims.First of all, if a resolution by the high house is accepted, particularly in the context of an initiative of the European Parliament, then in my opinion the democratic rules of the game require that such a requirement by the Commission is seriously treated within a reasonable period of time.So we have z.B. in the environmental area there is a white book on civil liability for environmental damage.This is a major progress, but I would like to remind you that this white book on a resolution of the 1994 Parliament, i.h.from six years ago.And after the white book, there is certainly plenty of time until a guideline appears.This makes it clear that the procedure is very slow and to explain why so much time is needed, a report is required in my opinion.Second: If a legislative proposal is announced in the legislative program, but its implementation is not carried out in the current year, the reasons for this must be presented.In addition an example.Today, a proposal for a guideline on electrical and electronic scrap is announced.This proposal has already been mentioned several times, but it has never been adopted.We know that this was based on the pressure of the US government that threatens with a lawsuit in front of the WTO, but it would make sense, fair, fair, democratic and transparent if the commission explained what is happening behind the scenes and why the submission of this guideline is long.Allow me to express my fears and fears with regard to the approach of your program for the year of 2000 you described as a year of the turn - and not just because it does not contain any really innovative suggestions.What worries us is rather the programmatic, semi -ideological approach of this work plan, its submissive and uncritical takeover of the US model - that anti -social and doped development model, the personalities that are sublime about every suspicion, such as the president of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.	de
The third goal consists in urban and rural development within the framework of a balanced spatial planning policy.The guidelines are also based on two horizontal principles: the development of rural areas - and the question of a sustainable traffic structure, Mrs. Ms. Rapportein, which has long been concerned with my heart, especially since my time as the Environment Minister of my country, belongs to me in the field of development of rural areas - and the second principle is equal opportunities, especially between women and men, as well as the European employment strategy and the economic and currency union.Ms. rapporteur, ladies and men, I would like to say about the concerns expressed in the pronunciation that the guidelines indicate the importance and determination of integrated development or conversion strategies, so that the priorities mentioned enable the greatest possible synergy effects of the measures and effective decentralized partnerships.They are worried because this partnership apparently has not been discussed.However, it is clearly mentioned on page 5 of these guidelines, and I would like to refer to it - because they have asked me - that this partnership for me - and I have looked after a region for long enough to be able to assess - is a very effective instrument for mobilizing intellectual resources at local level - both those in the public sector - the city and municipalities, the school and social areas, the associations and associations - as well asthose of the private sector.And the territorial pacts are one of the forms of this decentralized partnership to respond to a remark from Ms. Angelilli.The guidelines are ordered according to topic -related priorities so that they can be taken into account to different degrees within the framework of the individual goals depending on the specific situation of each Member State or its regions.Well, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly respond to some of your comments;First to the procedure.It is true that your house was only dealt with late.However, I would like to remind you that after the guidelines in the form of a draft in February 1999 according to a new procedure in which the submission of statements on the text had been passed, you were immediately forwarded to Parliament by my predecessor, Ms. Monika Wulf-Mathies.However, due to the upcoming European elections at the time, their house was only able to begin examining the guidelines after the text was finally adopted in July 1999.Today I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are only at the beginning during the negotiations on the programs - the committee chairman Mr. Hatzidakis has already asked me about this - and that your comments from most Member States can therefore actually be taken into account.I can also tell you that the Commission will take into account the opinion of your house, which is expressed in this report, when passing the guidelines for the prescribed so -called half -time valuation.Now on the content of the guidelines.Ms. rapporteur, you underlined that this is about making specifications for a number of often very precisely defined European goals.I cannot now call everyone: Introduction of cross -sector measures, more efficient use of public funds, support of the different partners in the joint development of regional or national programs, etc. The Commission takes note of this, but these specifications or questions do not belong here, for example, but, for example, in the Vademecum or the methodological document.	de
The Commission is aware that you want to immediately review the Directive on the European Corporate Council. As is recognized in the report we accept in the coming weeks, we accept that there is some room for interpretation in the Directive. However, different views must be taken into account when deciding whether the directive should be reviewed immediately, as the DiamantoPoulou, a member of the Commission of my colleague, has already emphasized in other contexts. First of all, all revisions on the Directive would have very little immediate impact on current contracts, unless the basic principle of respect for the negotiating parties is no longer complied with. Secondly, the immediate review of the Directive would be considerably complicated by thinking about the advancement of other topics in this field, such as European articles of articles or the unnoticed and consulted national level. Successful implementation of these other topics could make it much easier to review the Directive on the European Corporate Council and even provide some solutions to the above problems. As a result, we are leaning on the position that it would be best to start reviewing the European Corporate Council of the European Corporate Council after those two topics have been passed and the application of the Directive has been more comprehensively assessed. Activities are not limited to legislation. In order to promote and support dialogue as a key factor in adapting to change, the Commission has also begun to apply the recommendations of the Lillehammer report by preparing the establishment of a European Tracking Center for Industrial Changes. We also develop another proposal for this group of experts, a report on change management. Finally, I will be able to deal with some other concerns raised in the resolution submitted to Parliament. As for the strengthening of connections between competition policy and social policy, let me remind you that, according to the decree on mergers, the Commission will hear employees' representatives in an appropriate procedure. In general, we believe that all aspects of this kind of reform, including their employment effects, need to be thoroughly considered at different aspects. As an example of this, the authorities and, in particular, the Commission, in the context of the guidelines for national regional aid entered into force on January 1, have taken measures to ensure that public funding is closely related to the recipients of the regional aid and thus investment. For this objective, the condition for obtaining all regional support is that the investment in question is valid for at least five years. The same provision was included in the Structural Fund Regulation, which means that it applies to all investment funded by the Structural Funds. Social cohesion and the interaction of different political sectors at the EU level are the key topics of the upcoming Lisbon Summit. I know that we will return to these issues later in order to find out how we can best ensure that our policies have been adapted and renewed so that they can support the economic and social development of Europe. Much thanks, the Member of the Commission. Good member Gorostiaga atxlandabaso, you apparently want a procedure speech. If it is a personal statement, could you wait for the discussion to end, and I would love to give you a speech? Mr President, the problem concerns public value in Parliament;This is not a personal statement. This morning, Nicole Fontaine, President of Parliament, repeatedly refused to give me a procedural speech. Unfortunately, it was not the first time that the President attached to me in such a condemnable way. The President has thus violated Article 142, according to which the request for a procedure for procedure is prioritized in relation to all other requests for speech. He has also violated Articles 122, which gives all members of the Parliament the right to make comments, and in this case it was remarks that proved another member, Vidal-Quadras, the allegations. Our President's biased behavior should be very severely criticized. I am willing to accept his apologies at any time. Thanks for your statement. We are definitely ensuring that the President of the Parliament is informed of your statement. I can assure you that, at least for my knowledge, the President has never liked the debate during the vote.	fi
"Even within the EU, citizens are still suffering from violations of human rights and contracts. Daily is used in the type of misinformation and distortion of events to avoid equality of certain minorities towards the law and to defame ethnic minorities. Honestly, a hierarchy of oppression has been created. And as time people are not equal to the law, this inequality will lead to discrimination and human rights will be undermined. During our expansion process, the EU has very properly emphasized human rights and the protection of minorities. We must not renounce this commitment. However, we must also focus on our mirror and admit our own weaknesses. Of course, contracts have been signed, however they need actions. I would like to propose continuous checks of human rights practice and constant vigilance, not only outside our borders but also inside. For this reason, I would like an annual report from each Member State, which should record all charges against him and the measures taken. Because everything that happens in each Member State occurs in each of us. Everything that happens in another part of the world affects us. Pinochet in Chile is just as related to Haider in Austria. Human rights and individual freedoms are inextricably linked to each other. Human rights do not exist isolated, they are linked to our growth, economic, domestic policies, are in fact at the core of our democratic functions. I will repeat what Mr Patten said: We have to commit, we must inform and educate and in this way to bring about real and permanent changes.(Ppe-de).(Sv) Mr President, ""Europe means ideal, values ​​and principles. We must emphasize Europe's spiritual history. We must work together to restore the values ​​that unite Europe. The spiritual values ​​have emerged from Europe and spread all over the world. We must live with it.""This was said three hours ago by Czech President Vaclav Havel in this room. In this constructive speech, which stood out for the deep knowledge of human nature, the wisdom, historical knowledge and the clear perception of Europe's spiritual and Christian heritage, the Czech president pointed out as sources of inspiration for our action and human rights. We must be grateful that there are such heads of state as Vaclav Havel in our Europe. I would like to refer to two issues. The first concerns civil society. Vaclav Havel said that in Eastern Europe, Communist regimes scattered in pieces of civil society: popular movements, churches and independent trade unions. This is also done in China with the Falun Gong movement with the Catholic and the Protestant Church. This is done with the Lama in Tibet. We must never forget the protection of civil society. I would also like to refer to the death penalty. The EU, like my country, Sweden, supports its perception of man in the equal, unique and inviolable principle of human dignity. We should never regain this principle. This is what we said to the United States government, the government of Russia and the Chinese government."	el
It is very useful.It is an excellent contribution from Mr. Swoboda and his colleagues.We are very grateful to him to have been in the foreground in this area, as well as some of his colleagues, some of whom are present this evening within the Assembly - Ms. Pack, Mr. Lagendijk and others.I am very satisfied with what our general relations with ARYM are as good.Perhaps Mr. Dupuis, as well as his interpreter, will forgive me to use this expression in the spirit of the cordial agreement.The excellent representative of the European Union in this country has contributed to it.He was a great friend of the European Parliament and an excellent servant of the Commission.The best example illustrating the quality of our relationships is the imminent start of negotiations on the stabilization and association agreement.As is also the cooperation of ARYM with regard to the reconstruction of Kosovo.I thank the Macedonian authorities for helping their help in recent weeks, in order to cope with the considerable difficulties in electricity supply to Kosovo.Like certain deputies, I recognize the stabilizing role that this country played during the tragedy which took place in the Balkans, in particular with regard to the integration of the Albanian minority in the political and social life of the country.A few weeks ago, I saw the new president Georgievski, recently elected, and I was extremely impressed, like others, by his commitment to multi -thnicity and pluralism.Let me present to you the state of these negotiations than other countries in the region - as Mr. Lagendijk said - observe with immense interest.The Council adopted, on January 24 of this year, its negotiation directives for a stabilization and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.This represents the most important step in the process of stabilization and association of the western part of the Balkans initiated by the Commission in May 1999. Allow me to clarify the main elements of these directive projects.They cover inclusion in the arrangement agreement establishing a political dialogue with ARYM.They cover provisions with a view to improving regional cooperation, including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, although I would clearly say that there is no question of an attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and these countries during the ten years which will follow the entry into force of the agreement.They cover provisions concerning the circulation of workers, freedom of establishment, the provision of services, current payments and capital movements.They cover an ARYM commitment to bring its legislation closer to that of the European Community, especially in key fields on the domestic market;And they cover provisions concerning cooperation with ARYM in a wide range of fields, including justice and domestic affairs.We now carry out the necessary preparations in the Commission so that negotiations can start in March.I have to go to Arym in the second week of March.	fr
In addition, it should be noted that not all Member States can provide the same amount of information. Some countries have more sectors and considering the amount of information they should supply, they could have difficulties that they have the same amount of time at their disposal as those who do not have to supply as much information. Thus, in our opinion, these deadlines for the provision of information must be changed. Many of this information is also confidential, as is emphasized here, as they are directly related to the competitiveness of these sectors and the companies in question. Therefore, there is a need to act very carefully in this matter and guarantee the confidentiality of this information. Some of this information is irrelevant information, as well as stated, for example, those concerned with taxation of companies. Mr President, anyway, and since I don't want to talk too long because I know the problems of the lack of time, I want to congratulate the rapporteur Attwool for the important work he has done in our committee. I also want to congratulate the presenter Attwool and say that I agree with almost everything he said. I consider the proposal to be a weakness that reporting is not mandatory in all Member States. I cannot understand a proposal for a regulation that some Member States could not comply with without punishment, nor can I understand that in the European Union, where we are only 50 % self-sufficient in the domestic market demand of fish, given the existence of all kinds of very sensitive information. In my opinion, it would be important for the upcoming policy review in 2002 that we have all possible financial and biological information. In past years, someone told me that I had defended the decisions made by the Commission. It is not very easy to defend the European Union in the field of fisheries, but I have defended the Commission if decisions are made on the basis of appropriate scientific knowledge. As I examine the information, I find that they are actually quite confusing, the parts come one from here, and they do not create a clear, decent economic and biological image. If we do not get an overall picture, it is impossible to make sensible decisions about the future of politics within two years. It is not easy, I could really speak in my constituency for everyone in the coastal area, and say that they all agree on one thing, that is, that the European Union is to blame for all their problems and difficulties. Well, I do not agree with them, but I think we make bad decisions if our knowledge and decisions are not based on good scientific knowledge and if not everyone has an equal obligation to deliver it. Mr President, a Member of the Commission, the benefits of the deployment of information related to the fishing sector, both in quantitative and qualitative terms, cannot be agreed, especially in view of the UKP's 2002 reform. We also agree to provide community support to finance these activities. The common fishing policy must be as possible to coordinate the requirements for the preservation of species and the management of funds with the economic and market requirements. To this end, we need more extensive, compatible and uniform information that we expect to receive if they are collected and interpreted very wider general information about the Union's fishing sector. However, we also expect the special characteristics of fishing, differences, different situations and traditions to become more familiar and are valued and not be displaced, neglected or even eliminated, as has often been because of the unifying of fishing policies.	fi
I declare the session of the European Parliament interrupted.(The session is lifted at 12:25 pm) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which had been interrupted on Thursday, February 3, 2000. Adoption of the minutes of the previous session The minutes of the session on Thursday, February 3 was distributed.Are there observations?I note from your reaction that many deputies have not had this report and it is obvious that you cannot adopt a report that you did not have.I therefore propose to submit it to your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have it and I apologize.The adoption of the minutes is therefore postponed.Madam President is a procedural motion.This morning, the BBC reported that a British deputy for this assembly, which held a high position within its delegation, continues to provide strategic advice to private customers without however declaring in the register of financial interests of which it is.European citizens have the right to expect their representatives that they do not mix public interests and private advantages.However, they cannot be certain that it is not only if the information is both available to the public and easy to access.Madam President, since these questions are currently being examined by quaestors, can I ask you to use your influence at the same time to ensure that the register of financial interests be updated and modified in order to cover cases of this kind, and, above all, to ensure that this register can not only be the subject of an examination on the part of this assembly but that it is also published on the Internet?Thank you, Mr. Davies.I will see this question with the College of Quaestors.Madam President is a procedural motion.Since we are celebrating the first Valentine's Day today of the new millennium, I hope you agree that this parliament will be appropriate for this day by firmly committing to tackling the issue of cardiovascular disease, which are the main cause of mortality in Europe.I am urging the member states to align themselves with the commitment made today during the Winning Hearts Conference, namely that any child born in the new millennium has the right to live at least up to 65 years without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.Happy Valentine's Day!Madam President, I intervene in accordance with article 9 of the regulation of this assembly and I refer to the point raised by Mr. Davies concerning the very serious allegations broadcast on BBC radio this morning.I would appreciate that you guarantee us that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two deputies appointed in this particular interview with the BBC do not direct their companies from this parliament or parliamentary offices, because it would be very serious indeed.The policy of two weights, two measures followed in the past by the British conservatives, has thrown discredit on the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, and such behavior would strongly have a similar impact on this Parliament.	fr
We are proceeding with the rest of the agenda. Madam President, in the previous vote - and I will adhere to your decision on this issue - regarding the Commission's strategic plan, I expressed my intention to speak before the vote on behalf of my team. That didn't happen. I would appreciate it if I am allowed to justify my team's vote justification. This is an important issue. It would be useful to record in the minutes of the body how everyone perceives what we have just done, in the light of his own political analysis. Madam President, I do not intend to repeat the debate, but I had stated the desire to intervene on Mr Barsn Crespo's request. But you didn't give me the reason. I am sorry for that, but the vote was made, the decision was taken, so I consider the issue ended. I'm sorry, Mr. Hodnsch and Mr. Cox, I didn't see that you were asking for the reason. Under these circumstances, I think the positions are quite clear and will be recorded in summary minutes. When we approve the summary minutes of today's meeting tomorrow, colleagues who believe that positions have not been sufficiently explained, can request modifications. It seems to me that it is a good solution. It goes without saying that in summary minutes of tomorrow's session all additional explanations will be taken into account. I find it a better solution than to make voting justification that would late. Mr Cox, Mr Hodnsch, do you agree with that? Madam President, if the vote rightly records the way my team voted, I will not oppose it and I can not do so. If your decision is that I cannot justify voting, I accept it but with no reservation. We will therefore pay close attention to the drafting of summary practices. We always do it. If they do not adequately reflect the positions we will be able to correct them.(The House approves the provision of work as amended) Security Consultants for the transfer of dangerous goods The daily provision provides for the discussion of the report (A5-0105/1999) by Mr Koch, on behalf of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee on the Council of Commonwealth in viewof the Terms of Examination of Security Advisors for Road, Railway and Internal Floating Transfers of Dangerous goods (C5-0208/1999 - 1998/0106 (COD)). Honorable Mrs. Commissioner, Honorable Mrs. President, dear colleagues, I strongly welcome the council's joint position on the harmonization of the level of training of security consultants for road, rail and internal floating transport transport. First, we had to be formally active in order to meet the requirements of Directive 96/35/EC which binds Member States to appoint prevention officers or security advisors as well as the organization of training, education and examination of these individuals without explicitly developing it. Secondly, with this directive we will achieve a) more security both during transport and during the transportation of dangerous goods, (b) abolition of the distortions of competition as a result of completely different educational structures and expenditure for education in each state, as well as (c) the creation of equality of opportunities for security consultants in the European Market.	el
The values ​​must pass before power.We therefore deplore what is happening in Austria.Even more, we are shaken.We are deeply disappointed.We ask the ÖVP to further examine other solutions.We continue to insist on article 6 of the treaty.We continue to fight the trivialization of the far right.If the coalition still came to train, we call on our ÖVP colleagues to guarantee themselves in their programs, as well as in their words and in their gestures, of respect for the principles and values ​​which constitute the foundations of European integration.Madam President, my dear colleagues, Austria must face a heavy responsibility.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is obvious that within this Parliament, we are very widely agreed in our rejection of Haider and its policy, but it is just as clear that the opinions diverge as to the question of how to best fight this policy.Have you only asked yourself about the repercussions in Austria of this debate and the declaration made last weekend by the presidency of the council?Did you ask yourself the question of knowing our share of responsibility in the future development of the political situation in Austria if we decide to make a judgment on this file?You only asked yourself what would happen if the view of one of our colleagues was granted and that elections took place in Austria in the coming days.In the unanimous opinion of the observers, Haider would come out even stronger.Who may want such a thing?Do we not have the responsibility of carefully thinking about how to fight such a policy?Europe is a community of law.Among the principles that we must defend, there is democracy, respect for human law and the rule of law.The democratic requirement implies that we can deplore electoral results but that we must respect them and that is why we must respect the decision taken by the Austrians for reasons inherent in their policy.The rule of law requires that the presidency of the council will not be expressed as it did, in a way that contradicts the treaties.Politic intelligence commands not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it, as an undoubtedly democratic party, respectful of the rule of law and having demonstrated its European commitment, so that Austria remains in a just as undoubtedly undoubtedly a member of this European community.This is why we must support our ÖVP colleagues in this difficult situation and isolation is a completely wrong path.(Applause) Madam President, we say where I come from that a Welshman always takes it three times.It is actually three times - as you will notice during this debate - that I mean my desire to respond very briefly to what was an excellent, and sometimes disturbing, debate.First of all, I would like to thank, on behalf of the President Prodi and my colleagues from the Commission, several deputies of this assembly for their support and their understanding vis-à-vis the position taken by the Commission in the declaration that we made yesterday.	fr
"Likewise, I support a movement towards a linear career system, since the current system of career groups no longer meets the needs of our institutions.It certainly blocks the progress and mobility of people with demonstrably high performance potential.Those MEPs who have duly praised the commission staff in the course of this debate, whose vast majority are normally characterized by hard work, high integrity and performance, are absolutely right with their statements.The white book on the reform strategy will contain a detailed presentation of our concepts on this and other topics;Accuracy in detail is of course the top priority here.There will therefore be some messages for this in the coming months, and each individual will be advised and discussed here in this plenary.In the meantime, there is absolute clarity that we have to work closely with the parliament as an institution in central questions of common interest, in particular on the service and care payments as well as the civil servant statute.In connection with this last point, we are considering whether it would be useful to assume a framework regulation that contains general provisions on important questions such as salary, employment conditions, personnel representative rights, etc., but authorizes the individual institutions to introduce implementation provisions on other facts.Initial thoughts from the plenum about this consultative concept would be particularly welcome.In conclusion, I would like to go into paragraph 15 of the draft deflection in which the middle requirements of our reform strategies are addressed.This is a very important point.We are certain that we will have a significant ""reform dividend"" as soon as the modernization measures have been reflected in increased efficiency and better management of the use of funds.However, there is absolute clarity that parts of the commission service are already fully utilized.This has already been addressed by Parliament several times.Second, it is also clear that due to the reform, some new investments for qualification measures and technology are required.Third, there is completely no doubt that the preparations for the expansion must be intensified.Already now they have an impact on the availability of funds.It is also clear that with the assumption of new tasks - which is certainly brought to us by the council and parliament - we will have to name and sort so -called ""negative priorities"" in order to create additional capacities.Central feature of our reform will therefore be more determined in order to combine the determination of priorities with the funds on the basis of the measures -related budgeting.However, I would like to emphasize that the internal discipline is introduced by the Commission when setting the priority, but it can only be effective if the parliament and the council also take into account it and show a similarly determined attitude in relation to the claims of the Commission.For this reason, the Commission welcomes paragraph 15 of the report van Hulten.Mr President, I would like to come to the end and thank the Hohen house for his attention during an inevitable speech.At the same time, I would like to thank the rapporteur, the committee for household control and the other committees who have submitted their statements.We look forward to close cooperation with the plenary in the final formulation of the reform strategy package and, which is much more important, to constantly good cooperation in all the years that are necessary for the solution of such difficult tasks."	de
"It is simply recognizing their inferiority.But that I know, we never felt lower than men, and all the more in politics.So I believe that we all lead this fight to help our compatriots to access decision-making power, to access positions of responsibility in the political environment, but I believe that this will only be done with a real revolution of mentalities.We must be strong enough together to force our political leaders to impose the participation of women in political decision-making powers..(SV) Mr. President, Madam Minister, Madam Commissioner, ""half of the sky is supported by women,"" said an enlightened man one day.But when it comes to important decisions and priority subjects, women are lacking.Women, which constitute more than half of the population, are largely underrepresented in the fields of politics, economics and social action.It is an unacceptable fact in a democracy.Regarding equality between men and women, the gap between law and facts is nowhere more marked than in decision -making bodies.So that we can reach a balance, a concrete action plan with a fixed calendar is necessary.An important part of this plan would consist in a benchmarking system that can ensure the full participation of women in power structures and decision -making processes.I therefore be delighted that the commissioner is favorable to such a system.I propose that the European objectives concerning the participation of women in decision -making processes are based on the average obtained in the three most advanced member states in this area, with an annual report provided by all the Member States.These reports would then be the subject of an evaluation.Women are the first victims of human rights violations - in particular with rapes and sexual abuses, the ill -treatment suffered in the domestic framework and the trade of women - but they are underrepresented in the judicial and legislative institutions responsible for judging these criminal acts.As a result, these are not considered priority, and that very often, their authors are not the subject of prosecution.Women are also the most numerous victims of armed conflicts, but nevertheless remain absent from actions in favor of preserving peace, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.This is why we urge the Member States, in the text of the resolution, to increase the number of women who take part in all these activities in the service of peace.Equality between female and male participation in decision -making processes is not solely of social justice and democracy;It is also a necessity, to be able to fully exploit the experiences lived by women and their knowledge.The fact of not calling on the capacities of women in the decision -making process represents an unacceptable waste.Women must not only ""support half of the sky"", but also have the right to take their share of responsibility in decisions concerning the whole earth.Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the presidency of the council and the commissioner for their excellent interventions.We expect a lot from your action.We start a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their possibility of occupying places of decision."	fr
As for the violence practiced by police and prison staff, there are still a lot to do. As far as third countries are concerned, there is a fundamental and urgent need for the European Union to acquire a common strategy that the Council is called upon to chart with the cooperation of this parliament, and which must be consistently integrated into all European Union policies, and in particular into development policy. It makes no sense to display, depending on the requirements of Realpolitik, more demands than to them, it makes no sense to be more condescending with certain states than with others, or to promote policies of cooperation with states that violate fundamental human rights, where the principles of the rule of law are not observed. If we continue to support, politically and economically, the countries where these phenomena are observed, we will end up being complicit regimes who do not respect human rights and with which the legitimate question arises whether Community assistance actually reaches the peoples whose growth is not to prompt it,bank accounts of some of their leaders. Madam President, ladies and gentlemen, if one can even see things even without prejudice, then he will find that there is no trace of racism in the broader medium of this parliament and I am absolutely sure of it. If, however, conflicts are created in relation to a racism report, then we should not look for the racism of parliament, but rather in the exhibition itself. This report is not mentioned e.g. Only praiseworthy words about the fight against racism, but also some issues, such as the right to vote for third -party nationals in some states or the right to become a public servant - access to the career in the public sector - that is, issues for which one can decide positively or do not have a positive or negative. And precisely at these points is an exposure an unfair construct - and I want to say it clearly. In this case, the struggle against racism, for which we are all committed, becomes a political currency without an impact and exploitation. Therefore, exposure to its current form does not find us agree. I am vertically opposed to diminishing in this way the gravity of racism, thus making it a political controversy. This is our deepest criticism of the methodology of the exhibition. We are all against racism. We all contribute to combating it and this issue should be a wide majority in this Parliament. But it is not possible for one side of the body to claim and make use of this concept to conduct a political struggle. We should insist that the processing of such an important issue is done in a way that everyone can agree, and this was not done in the present case. Madam President, I congratulate the four rapporteurs on their work, and especially Baroness Ludford who continued a job that I, among other things, helped to start almost a half decade ago, with the first Racism and Fascism Research Committee in Europe, which was a member of the New York. Evrigenis, the implementation of the work of which Mr Le Pen has said that he will try to prevent in every way.	el
This applies to review 5, except for its first part, 8, the first part of the first part of the check 10, the third part of the revision 12, 16, 20, 22, 24 and 25. These proposals can all be accepted. Reviews 6 and 21 are new;The Commission may accept them. The Commission may also approve 26 reviews after certain editorial changes. I would like to emphasize that some of the other reviews concerning the basic components of the proposal shall include significant watering of its level of environmental protection, which is the purpose of the common position. They cannot therefore be accepted. Parliament has traditionally strongly influenced the strengthening of European environmental legislation. I would be amazed and depressed if this was not the case today. I am very concerned about certain proposals for the Parliament, which question the absolute basic pillars of the proposal. They apply, for example, to the phased removal of heavy metals, the manufacturer's responsibility and the requirement for recycling. I will deal with these reviews by group. Checking 4, 11, 12, 13, 28, 30, 32, 37, 42 and 48 apply to the phasing removal of heavy metals. Inspection 12 includes the fact that the entry into force of the order will be transferred at least 10 years later. Reviews 13, 28, 32, 37, 42 and 48 bring unnecessary conditions and exceptions. It would mean that the process of compensation for hazardous substances is progressing slower. Checking 4, 11 and 30 indicate that heavy metals must be separated from waste before recycling. The Commission is of the opinion that it is technically easier to implement the step -by -step removal proposed in a common position. Checking 17, 18, 27, 34, 36, 38, 44 and 45 apply to the manufacturer's liability. The compromise that the Council has ended up is fair but weak. The Commission does not believe that the review proposal would improve the balance without creating tension. I am sorry for the confusion that was recently caused by the fact that the Commission's internal documents were misused, which aroused uncertainty about the Commission's attitude to the question. I would like to emphasize that the Commission as early as 1997 proposed a special expression of the manufacturer's liability and that the Commission supports a fully common position. It does not make disproportionate costs for manufacturers, far from it. Reviews 39, 40, 46 and 47 for quantity targets. The high level of protection that is aimed at in a common position would narrow a lot if the recycling target set for 2006 were to be removed. These checks would make it difficult and difficult to monitor the processing of goals. I can also comment - listen to what I say now, because I have heard this many times during the conversation - a question of museum cars, mentioned in 3, 7, in the second installment of 9 and 35. These vehicles are not included in the Waste Definition. So anything has been claimed here, museum cars and motorcycles are not included in the directive. We do not think that checks 2 and 14 would bring anything new to the directive. Checking 23 means that the Commission must approve quality standards for re -used components. These are not included in the Directive. They would require a special directive of the European Parliament and of the Council. Checking 29, 31 and 41 will wate up the claim. In particular, checks 31 and 41 endanger the recycling of plastic, tires and glass. Finally, the Commission cannot approve checks 1 and 33 for reasons related to legal clarity, nor the revision 19, which the Commission is unnecessary at this stage. Checking 43 is not part of the Directive application sector. Much thanks, the Member of the Commission. The discussion has ended. The vote will be taken next. Votes.(EN) Mr President, as you know, is that we vote for this report today and we did not vote for it last week, are a number of serious translation errors, especially in the French version.	fi
So it is possible that there is a lot of life there, and much of it is much more sophisticated than ours. Remembering that the first earth television programs are now 50 light -years away in space, far beyond the closest stars, I invite you to imagine with me what the beings will think about us as they see us. What do they see? They see a beautiful planet overflowing with life, but they see its atmosphere pollute and heated. They see forests logging and deserts spreading. From living beings can see many animals to be treated brutal and rarely disappear forever. How do they see the current dominant species - that is us? Well, they see the earth's resources being distributed unevenly. They see Earth's claim, illness medicines, but not for the parts of the world that need them most, school books - but not at least for the less developed areas of our planet, 50% of the world's population never making a phone call throughout its life. What do they see about the relationships between human beings? They see us killing each other. They see each other limiting each other's freedoms. They see an endless series of local wars. They see some of our children recruiting in the army as soldiers, or treating them as prostitutes or slaves. They see unequal treatment of men and women, people of different age, minorities, people of different skin color, different breeds, different beliefs, immigrants, and even neighbors. We all know this picture. The United Nations Convention on Human Rights 50 years ago was an attempt to repair this situation. We have to officially greet it - and I think we do it. In Europe alone, human rights are legally applicable. Here in the European Parliament, some Members do not want the human rights map, which is currently being discussed, to be legally binding. I declare that it is a shame for them! Human rights must be legally applicable to every country in the world. This is the goal to which we have to work. Many, as Commissioner Mr Patten said, are left to become. Finally, if you were asking me: What if there is no life out there in those stars, what if we are alone? Is this a thought that inspires awe, and I would answer: you don't think we also have the responsibility to make our children behave properly before letting them go out there, to move to other planets? Mr President, human rights are universal, inseparable, interdependent and interrelated. This famous wording, which is included in the conclusions of the United Nations World Conference on Human Rights in 1999, can be aware of it from the outside. That's nice. But where is the issue of human rights in the EU itself? Is this a picture of interdependence reflected? Does the European Union really have a human rights policy? With this question I do not bother to refer to the views of Member States on foreign policy, which differ and do not follow the same line in human rights violations in other areas such as, for example, in China.	el
"I still believe that we must reserve a ""quality chocolate"" for only a kind of chocolate that does not contain other vegetable fats and advised to conduct a study on the effects of this measure on cocoa developing countries;Finally, I still hope for a clear and accurate entry for consumers. This is a principle of principle that is difficult to negotiate because it is a defense of quality products and consumers we all are. That is why I urge our parliament to approve the reviews submitted by our rapporteurs and thus express their opposition to the position of the Committee on the environment, public health and consumer policy..(Fr) things are busted. In Europe, which insists on the desire to protect consumers and talks about quality markings and authenticity, we now have a common position in the Council, which prefers to ruin a high -quality product, chocolate, and to offend multinational companies in the food industry. Should it even be surprised because the same Europe produces crazy cows, shaking sheep and dioxin chickens and imported hormone meat and genetically modified grain. Of course, consumers are ""informed"" that the purchased product has been falsified. But what kind of hypocrisy! What kind of information! In lower case letters and in an incomprehensible language on the reverse of the packaging. You tend to do anything in your doctrine, free movement, free competition and free trade. But I ask that you will no longer do anything for our food traditions, quality products or local products. Don't play with food anymore. That would be real progress. You must understand: the coordination of the European right -wing parties includes my colleague and I vote for the ""zero alternative"", with zero percentage of vegetable fats other than cocoa butter in chocolate..(Fr) Would you have believed? More than 25 years after the first chocolate discussion of the European Parliament, I will again be involved in the discussion about the big question of whether the product can be called chocolate if it has not only been used in the production of cocoa butter.25 years ago, and today, this question even divides parliament to the extent that my group did not make a ballot list and the party discipline did not work, which I think is admirable in such a situation. So I was free to bring out that I am in favor of a solution, which I think is the best for genuine chocolate producers, a genuine chocolate, which is appreciated by gourmeters who think that cat must be called a cat and chocolate chocolate if it is really made of cocoa butter. I am very sorry that we did not have a consensus on the solution that I think was the most sensible, that is, the name ""chocolate"" is reserved for products that contain 100 % extracted vegetable fats extracted from cocoa, and that the use of other vegetable fats is prominently reported in the wraps of the products containing them.in the united market. In the field of chocolate, as in other areas, there are different cultures and traditions, as we know. Taste issues are personal. Of course, alongside the taste and quality aspects of the product, there is a development policy aspect: associated countries, ACT countries, are indeed afraid to lose about $ 160 million in revenue if our large industrial producers start using other vegetable fats 5 %, which is not prescribed but cannot be controlled. When this is the case, I would rather have given the common position to be abandoned, as well as I prefer to eat good traditionally made chocolate rather than industrially produced chocolate that cannot be controlled at the moment. Unfortunately, the small majority of Parliament was not in the opinion that consumers could enjoy good and genuine chocolate..(PT) In the early stages of the principles that all Member States would generally be allowed to produce chocolate in all Member States, with a certain percentage of vegetable fats instead of cocoa butter. In this way, we make the reasons related to the legal benefits of cocoa producer countries and also to consumer protection."	fi
Let me be allowed to thank Mr. Andersson for the rest he gives to his main question and to answer them as follows.First, Finland and Denmark have exceptions to the principle of free movement of goods until 2003. These countries are busy taking preparatory measures in order to be ready for the free access of alcoholic products by 2003. In the case of Sweden, the situation is somewhat different.In 1995, it was decided to set up a five -year derogatory period, a period which is now expiring.I have yet heard any argument on the basis of which the Commission should consider an extension of this period.Second, we have a permanent consultation process with the Swedish government.I can point out to Mr. Andersson that I will go to Stockholm on March 6 to chat with the Minister Ringholm, with members of the Swedish Parliament and, on request, with the Prime Minister or other ministers, with a view to continuing the debate on this file which - I understand it perfectly - is the subject of lively political passions in Sweden.Third, I naturally understand the importance of the health aspect of this dossier very well.I repeat once again that Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund said that regardless of the evolution of events in importing restrictions, alcohol consumption in Sweden will remain unchanged.The question is then of course to know where the amount of alcohol is not introduced by travelers arriving in the country comes from.The answer is that it is made in fraud or that alcohol is produced by the Swedes themselves and, as Mr. Andersson knows, it is a particularly dangerous and harmful process.That said, Mr. Andersson seems to think that the health situation is improving as soon as the import of alcohol is limited.In this case, however, not only Sweden but all countries of the European Union should start from the principle of the prohibition of any alcohol sale.We were able to observe a similar example in the United States.Mr. Andersson is certainly aware of what has been named prohibition.He also knows what resulted in the Maffia activities in the United States, where we ended up putting an end to prohibition.This simply means that you should of course protect health but not by prohibiting alcohol, as it is useless.Mr. President, it is all the same, in reality, Swedish monopoly revenues on alcohol and, if the Swedish government says that it must thus cover the costs in the health sector, this proves that it is a distortion of competition, since other countries must finance their costs in the sector themselves without having a monopoly on alcohol.What I would like to know is if you also know studies according to which moderate consumption of quality alcohol, for example Franconia wine or Bavarian beer, is good for health and would therefore reduce the Swedish budget.I understand that Mr. Posselt began to raise the tax aspects of this file.I also believe that I know that the high taxation of alcoholic products in Sweden dates back to the year 1638 and that, since that time, the State has perceived a significant part of its tax revenues from the sale of alcoholic products.	fr
In our opinion, the relevant questions are the topicality and goals of the HVK and also the things that are sure to be disputed there. We suspect the topicality of the conference because we are afraid of the goals in sight that may not be related to the preparation of future expansion that is always discussed. It reveals something in particular on the issues that are pursued, especially in the case of unresolved issues in Amsterdam, which gives rise to suspicion of future administrative machinery, which is impossible to accept - but also for other and third pillar issues, mainly related to the unwanted militarization of the European Union. These are some of the ultimate reasons that we do not agree with the content of the resolution, even though I appreciate it..(SV) In order to influence the development of the development of the European Parliament, the European Parliament must adopt a more constructive attitude to the agenda of the inter-governmental conference on the agenda than in this resolution, which focuses far too much on the disappointment and negativeness of the European Council in Helsinki in December 1999. The Committee on the European Parliament and its Basic Contracts, Procedure and Institutions should have preferred to have been more accurate and concentrated on only a few things in addition to the decisions of the Helsinki Council of Finland, and thus express what they think are the most important issues to be discussed, including the appointment of the General Prosecutor for the European Union and their financial interests. We Swedish Christian Democrats also oppose the fact that the EU expansion to the east is at risk of being delayed if the inter -governmental conference is not widely extended by the issues that were unresolved at the previous inter -governmental conference in Amsterdam in 1997. So, of course, I support the fact that the European Parliament is now officially showing the green light to start the inter -governmental conference. However, I believe that the inter -governmental conference must restrict the issues that are essential in order to implement the expansion. Otherwise, I will refer to the voting explanation I made on November 18, 1999, where I will investigate my position on the overtime and common defense. Common Resolution: The President of Austria, the European Europe group, did not join a joint resolution between PPE -de and PSE, which concerned the political situation in Austria after the emergence of the coalition government between Conservatives and Jörg Haider's nationalists. Thus, this resolution between PPE-de and PSE is supported by 14 Member States' initiatives to put pressure on Austria with a kind of diplomatic boycott. What is most upset about us is that this intervention is praised in the principles of the establishment of a Treaty based on the establishment of the establishment, so that nowadays, the heads of neighboring states can invalidate what the people are free and democratically expressed in the elections. In addition, in this case, neighboring states have been strictly abstained from asking the opinion of their own citizens. For any verbal slips, Jörg Haider has been guilty of which we really regret, the Austrians have made a democratic choice, and we must respect it. It is clear to us that the Left of the European Parliament, together with the left -wing left -wing, has done a purely political trick by invoking a creepy but fortunately ending era. Although Haider's assimilation to Hitler lacks all credibility, it has partially reached the target, that is, guided certain members of the PPE-de group to an ill-considered solution. What is much more significant than this political trick itself, the majority of the European Parliament is, above all, of the fact that the cooperation between the right and the left was questioned in Austria - which corrupted political culture - not a way of thinking about a European system where power is divided between certain parties. To avoid this, we are ready for everything, e.g.to invalidate the result of the free elections and to start monitoring thoughts and a new kind of totalitarianism.	fi
I have realized that the association wrote to the Quppors' college on January 26 and asked for permission to set up a table outside the session today to promote its initiative. I understand the same day member Balfe gave the assistants permission. Parliament units wanted to meet the assistants yesterday to agree on the necessary practical arrangements. However, the meeting was canceled at the last minute. Parliament has not yet told why the permit was canceled. Member Banotti apparently promised to write a letter explaining why the permit was canceled, but the letter has not yet arrived. Can you find out why the permission given to assistants was canceled at the last minute? Do you agree that assistants have justified the reasons to be heard? Do you do everything possible to prevent such last -minute cancellations anymore? Do you do everything that can be accepted as soon as possible? Finally, do you ensure that before that, the regulations of the Parliament are properly applied and that the assistants should be paid, as they should be paid, for all the work they do for us? Without them, Parliament would not be able to work. Mr President, I also use a procedure for procedure. Are there any regulations or provisions on the parliamentary building, demonstrations outside the doors of the Chamber, so that we can ensure that members of the European Parliament can freely perform their duties in the Chamber? If there are such regulations who are responsible for their implementation and how do they perform that task? Mr President, I would like to return to the problem of staff rules that we have always considered paramount and announced that the Italian members of the group - we have, at the request of the group chairman Barón Crespo, submitted agreements with the assistants. I think this is a concrete gesture to solve this problem. Therefore, I would like to urge the President of the Parliament to consider whether it would be appropriate for himself to urge all members of the Parliament to do the same. Mr President, first I would like to say that I fully support the staff rules for assistants. When I arrived in Parliament yesterday, I received a document about the demonstration planned by the assistants outside the doors of Parliament. As all colleagues know -and many of you have contacted me over the last six months -all the expressions and the like are first discussed in the so -called Comart Committee in Parliament. As an example of this, I would mention that for obvious reasons, the Parliament may not have commercial exhibitions. After receiving the letter yesterday, I immediately informed the assistants that we would suggest that they would probably hold a meeting or demonstration in the near future and possibly next month. However, all expressions must be carried out in such a way that they do not interfere with the proper activities of the Parliament. Yesterday afternoon, I signed a letter at a meeting of the Parliament Presidential President, telling the assistants here. However, I have heard that the chairmen of the groups informed them of this decision orally last Thursday, so they were fully aware of it. They can, of course, give us their opinion and possibly meet in the next session of Parliament. However, there was some misunderstanding because they received a letter from someone else, in which they thought they were authorized. However, all expression is first discussed in the so-called Comart Committee. As you can see, there are many protests in the Parliament about different countries or whatever. This is not an attempt to censor or oppose the very real and legitimate principle that we should have personnel rules for assistants. I thank you, member Banotti. It seems to me that your speech clarifies various questions that have come up. Mr President, I wanted to bring up an important principle. I personally believe that it is scandalous that parliamentary members are intervening here in a demonstration rather than a problem solving, that is, fair terms, fair pay and fair working hours.	fi
I hope that Helsinki's decisions will lead to progress in the Cyprus question, and that a new time of hope for Cyprus will break.I would welcome it if Turkey now played a constructive role in the Cyprus question.I am pleased that both the Council and the Commission welcomes the efforts of the UN to accept rapprochement talks between the two ethnic groups in Cyprus, by which reconciliation and trust formation between them should be promoted.I welcome the support of the Commission for the Cyprus, which consisting of two zones and two eternal groups, for which the United Nations has been working for so long, and on the structure of which both the Greek and the Turkish side in Cyprus should work with all the might.I am happy about the political thaw in the relationships between the Greek and the Turkish government.My hope is that this will have a positive effect on Cyprus talks.I also hope that the aids that Cyprus are available as part of the accession are partly used to promote this reconciliation and strengthening of trust, and that both sides of the separate ethnic groups in Cyprus will accept and use this money in the spirit in which it is given.We all in the European institutions - in Parliament, in the Council and the Commission - should do our best to help Cyprus in the search for a peaceful solution, through which the two ethnic groups that were separated over so many years can be brought together again.President, Dear Colleagues, Verdem Rats President and Value, Mr. Commissioner Verheggen!The ordinance for the accession aids is not exactly a figurehead for the coherent work of the Commission.This merging of auxiliary constructions leaves me the impression of amateurism.This affects both the content of the content and the financial aspect.With this, I believe that the citizens in Cyprus and Malta can hardly present the membership activities on the part of the Union as evidence that it is worth joining.Vaclav Havel correctly said today that the European Union in its political quality is measured by what it brings it.From the perspective of civil society, it is crucial what a regulation brings.With this regulation, you cannot win a broomstick in this regard.It contains external determination paragraphs and is temporary, and this does not allow itself to be shiny.The quality of an aid is measured on the following standards: Is it decentralized, is it transparent, is it close to the citizen and works?Nevertheless, for the shared island of Cyprus, this approach strategy is combined with a major political challenge.In my view, the task of the European Union is to use all instruments and also to contribute to political conflict resolution on the island.At this point I have to say that the amendment to the European Parliament is also very important to me here.The Commission and the Council also keep very hopeful speeches today.I am very, very happy that we go in one direction.	de
"The adoptions of this day are not only contrary to the treaty and grant the Union bodies more powers than those returning to it, but above all, they will produce a contrary effect.These sanctions will not affect Mr. Haider or the FPö, quite the contrary;They will strengthen them.We will get exactly the opposite of what we are looking for.It is not in this way that we must fight the racism and the push of the far right.Danish liberal deputies of the European Parliament insist that the adoption of this day does not in any case constitute support provided by the Parliament to the diplomatic sanctions decided by the fourteen prime ministers against Austria.This is why the Danish liberal deputies of the Assembly supported the very firm disavowal expressed by liberal deputies with regard to any form of xenophobia in Austria and elsewhere.We attach great importance to the possible use of the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty allowing to deprive the right to vote within the Council of EU ministers any country which, by its acts, violates the fundamental rights of citizens through discrimination, etc.(Article 7).The participation of the Freedom Party in the Government of Austria is a dangerous development to become the political becoming of the European Union.It is the ""belly of the beast"" which, unfortunately, appears on the political scene greater than ever since the Second World War.The European Parliament and the governments of the Union are required to politically isolate a government in which admirers of Nazism and the singers of xenophobia participate.The European Union carries great responsibilities - and with it, the members of the two main political currents, the social democrats and the Christian democrats - because by focusing in a dogmatic manner to the financial financial political of the UEM, by dismembering the welfare state, by dividing unbridled competition, it has marginalized large layers of society and it offers the extreme right -wingto enlist supporters in their neonazia adventure..Given that the regulations of the European Parliament do not allow us to present our own resolution condemning the Party of Haider, as well as all the parties of any European country what is propagating racist infamies, xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted the resolution of compromise, without approving several expected or terms, to show our solidarity with those who, in Austria,Austrian and his demagoguery.Our vote in no way means a deposit of the parties signatory to this compromise resolution, neither to their present policy, nor to their future attitude in the event of aggravation of the threat of the extreme right.Some of these parties, which assert themselves republicans and democratic, take up, by complacency or electoral calculation, the demagoguery of the extreme right, if only by making, openly or hypocritically, the presence of immigrant workers responsible for unemployment and by making their life more difficult.More generally, those of the signatory parties which direct or direct the governments of different countries of the European Union have their share of responsibility in the influence acquired by the extreme right by carrying out a policy which, by dedication to the interests of the big employers, does not want to take measures likely to eradicate the unemployment and the misery which it thus leads to and thus facilitates the xenophobic demagogy of the extreme right."	fr
Then I have to make sure and I will make sure that this partnership is decentralized. All I can do is work with the Greek government. I think my colleague Alavanos gives the Commission member all this information so that he or she takes it into consideration, because it is indeed a propaganda and not a presentation of some community programs. However, I would like to ask a valuable Commission member to take into account the following: National and Regional Programs for national and regional programs, Greece is considered to be a completely remote area for which the European Union's partnership level - central government, central government. From this point of view, local self -government, such as NGOs, such as farmers' cooperatives, would not be able to participate in the development of a third frame of support or previous support frameworks, such as non -governmental cooperatives. How could the Commission intervene? Member of Parliament Theonas, I repeat again what I already said to the Alavanos that I investigated the matter very closely and that I will do notes in accordance with the Structural Fund Regulation and, as needed, notes on the pre -granting of the Structural Funds, but not the use of these funds because they are not yet tied. However, I say once again that I have to take into account the national authority with whom I have to go to these negotiations. However, I look at things impartially. Good member Theonas, I say, for example, that if you want to make recommendations or suggestions for bringing this or that structure, I understand, I will be open to them, and I am ready to take them forward. Members of the European Parliament act, in accordance with their task, and, in accordance with my role, to move them forward, as long as they follow the life and letter of the Structural Fund Regulation. Why not say that we have noted from the Greek government in previous years certain omissions in the application of the new regulation and the previous regulation on the involvement of representatives of civil society. I say this impartially, and when we find a problem or neglect, this problem or this neglect must be removed. So I will take care of this in the implementation of the new community support framework.-Question 45 (H-0041/00): Subject: Structural Fund Support for Civilian Energy Research, Can the Commission confirm that the research on nuclear fusion and fission was not granted Structural Fund Support during the last program of programs 1994-1999? Could it also confirm that in negotiations and programs for the new programming season 2000-2006, which are currently underway with Member States, are not funded by Member States? What is the importance of structural fund support for supporting renewable energy sources? Will the Structural Fund Support intend to focus on supporting regional and renewable energy sources in the energy sector? Are there any large -scale energy transfer networks from the Structural Funds? I would like to respond to Member Isler Béguin for the first paragraph and remind him that improving the scientific basis and technical capacity of the regions to increase their competitiveness was one of the community's priorities in the previous programming period. Support from the Structural Funds during that season in favor of technical cohesion, that is, for the benefit of technical research and development in conjunction with the community support frames, is estimated to be approximately EUR 7.5 billion. A good member of the Parliament, it is almost 6 % of the overall aid issued by the community. For your particular concern, I want to tell you that the Commission does not intend to directly fund technical research and development through Structural Funds in the field of nuclear power, and did not do so in the previous season. The selection of projects to be carried out within the framework of these community support frames remains the responsibility of the authorities responsible for their management in the Member States. A good member of the Parliament, a Member State, may therefore decide to finance research and development projects in the field of civilian nuclear power, even though this is not part of the community's priorities, as long as these projects only contribute to regional development and does not always need to be systematically reported to the Commission. As far as you know about another renewable energy source, as you know, you know, and will certainly continue to be of interest, the Commission's approach will be presented in a document on the Structural Funds and their cohesion with the Cohesion Fund.	fi
"We need to be able to primer it carefully. With regard to Southeast Europe, I agree with you that we weigh political institutions through their achievements. During the lifetime of this Commission and Parliament, we must succeed in providing peace in Southeast Europe, even though it is difficult. We have a positive attitude towards stabilization and association agreements, but we would like more. We will publish this material and present it later this week in the discussion on Swoboda's report. The strategy document emphasizes the global role of the European Union. Our main goal is to have the weight of the Union in global issues that is proportional to its weight in the field of support, trade and funding. At the beginning of this decade, we need to anticipate how our institutions will develop internationally by the end of the decade, and in particular what is our role in international financial institutions, UN agencies, and so on. We need to start a conversation about it. Finally, this morning, the day after Valentine's Day, the newspapers read that your honeymoon season is over. Chairman Prodi, I don't know if you are a romantic or not. Perhaps it is very disgusting to say this morning. However, we have a positive attitude towards this in the liberal group because this means that we are now about to work. That's what it must be. As you described Europe with many adjectives - energetic Europe, enterprising Europe, human -faced and permissive Europe -, I would like to use a word close to my liberal colleagues and describe a one with an adjective we want to see your administrative plan: enabling Europe. Mr President;Mr President of the Commission, I greatly appreciate the transparency that you recognize that the European Union must change basically. You are considering very fundamental issues as your program. I believe that citizens are starting to become more interested in politics if we are able to raise big questions alongside everyday small things. At the same time, however, it has to be said that unfortunately your program is in many respects reminiscent of a party program. It has a lot of good purposes, but it largely lacks concrete suggestions on how to do all of this. As in any party program, there are also many internal contradictions. I would like to help you identify these internal conflicts with my speech. First of all, the economy and social development: we must be able to consider how we reconcile the goal of competitiveness with the purpose of full employment;That is mentioned in your program. Should we finally make a convergence criterion where - as you actually suggest this program - the goal is that in any Member State, unemployment should not be higher than say in the three most successful countries? The ecological tax reform is the one that my group wants to emphasize. Namely, we can only create employment and sustainable development by changing the structure of taxation, but unfortunately - as we all know - this is an area where the European Union is completely incapable of acting. Be good and take this issue at the inter -governmental conference. The European Union can only get its justification for focusing on tasks that individual countries cannot perform alone. In this respect, Parliament will certainly defend the importance of supranational decision -making with you. One internal contradiction in your program is related to globalization. I find it very meritorious that you highlight the concept of ""global control"", as others have said here. However, also learn about Seattle's events: we have to bring together the freedom of world trade and, on the other hand, all the human things we want to defend. You must start dialogue with civil society. Be good and democratic about international organizations. The European Union could be decisive in the process in which the United Nations and the World Trade Organization are indeed under democratic control."	fi
The events of the past few years have certainly been awareness of the dangers to which food safety and human health are exposed to, and has given rise to concern.The immediate reaction of parliament must undoubtedly be understood by all citizens as the most important guarantee for the future, because as a member of parliament, they have thus created framework conditions for the quality of food, according to which the Member States have to be directed.However, even in this crucial area of ​​administration, the parliament of the principle of subsidiarity is aware and asks the Member States to take responsibility accordingly and to do justice to it.With the Agenda 2000, in my opinion, we focus on politics that are of direct concern for the citizen, such as food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.If we implement this agenda committed and purposefully, then the first years of the new millennium will develop into a milestone in the implementation of politics that are close to the citizens and reflect on the needs of the community.In particular, I welcome the proposed new strict approval processes for additives in animal feed.Those who demonstrably violate this must be punished strictly.I speak to Mr. Byrne, the new commission member, whose responsibility is the food security.He has a difficult task, but he reacted quickly and effectively to the requirements of this house as well as the concerns of consumers.I am particularly happy that my home country Ireland is one of the pioneers when implementing the new food legislation based on the principle of traceability.Ireland will develop into a competence center for food production of the future.President, Mr. Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work and in particular my joy about unanimity that prevailed in the parliamentary group on this point.It is therefore intended that the Commission replaces the current approvals by regulation by approvals that are bound to those responsible for the placement of the additive.It is necessary to restore a coherent legal framework.The Commission already proposed the introduction of a legal basis for the replacement of the approvals in Directive 70/524/EEC.But we have to make sure that there are no distortions of competition, as Mr. Kindermann and Ms. Auroi have already underlined.In my opinion, a clear declaration of genetically modified feed additives is required so that the end consumer is enabled and guaranteed to choose food without GMO or with GMO.The consumer must be able to freely decide in full expertise.This proposal has no financial impact on the community budget, Mr. Commissioner.Therefore, in the area of ​​food safety, complete transparency for producers and consumers must prevail.I am convinced that the commission can join the rapporteur who, as I would like to remind you - was unanimously supported in the committee for agriculture and rural development.President!Since BSE times we have repeatedly said in this house that animal nutrition is one of the most important and first elements for the safe production of food, health and protection of consumers.We are therefore pleased that the Commission presents a proposal for additives for feed.	de
"Inquiry No. 6 of (H-0122/00): concerns: Ethnic cleansing on Serbs in Kosovo since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU with the argument to prevent ethnic cleansing on Kosovoalbanians through Serbs, and since the station of the KFOR on June 12, 1999, 200,000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been sold and 768killed.This ethnic cleaning is therefore far more ""thoroughly"" than the one carried out by the Serbs.In the past few days, Serbs have been killed by members by members Kosovoalbanian Mafiagruppen with impunity.What is the decision to the Council in order to put an end to these ethnic cleansing and to ensure the respect of human rights for the entire population of Kosovo, regardless of race and belief?Mr. President, forgive you, but when you hear the representative of the council talked like that, you really wonder how far the hypocrisy, the granting and complicity are still being driven.In the house of what is hung, you really don't talk about the rope, as a saying says with us.Yugoslavia was a peaceful country, a guarantee for stability and peace.After the interventions of NATO and initially Germany, the known events occurred.So the government in Belgrade, but NATO, is not responsible, the imperialists are responsible with their interventions.What about today?Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council was disregarded in every respect, which proves that this was a trap.350,000 Serbs, gypsies and members of other nationalities except the Kosovoalbaners have been expelled, 900 murdered, 800 were kidnapped.Eight months later, the resolution of the security council is brutally kicked with feet.For example, the UCK was not only disarmed within three months, as intended in the resolution, but contrary to the claims of Mr. Kouchner in the European Parliament, equipped with modern equipment and appointed the ""Kosovo protection corps"".Because the Minister Mr Kouchner mentioned, I would like to point out that the latter with his 25 commands also disregards the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and the resolution of the Security Council.He has introduced a separate currency, his own judiciary ... (the President interrupts the speaker.) We see the facts in the eye, Mr. President.I would like to thank the Minister for his answer, but also remind you that statistically speaking, more violence is carried out today in Kosovo than before NATO's bombing.It is worrying that the bombing tightened the situation, and it should admit that NATO and the European Union's approach, when they took this measure, was wrong.The Minister has fully right - I agree to him - about Belgrade's fault, but one should not forget that the secret services of the United States, Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain have delivered the Uck, a mafia, weapons and money to contribute that there are problems in this area.That is why we are all guilty.I would like to ask you an additional question about your reference to the overall context.Are you not of the opinion that it would be advantageous to lift the blockade against Serbia so that there is greater economic norm in the area and also benefits Kosovo as a province of Serbia?"	de
"The Water Framework Directive is a necessary initiative. Nevertheless, and starting with the fact that the idea of ​​solidarity is inherent in the process of European construction, there is a need to take into account in this directive that water resources must be perceived as a factor in social cohesion. Water - no one disputes it - is a common good. However, in the case of Spain and other countries in the South, characterized by unstable climatic conditions, water resources management requires political choices of rationalizing their use and other solidarity measures. Consequently, we believe that this framework directive must propose a use of water that allows the territorial imbalances to be overcome, and for this purpose I ask you to support the amendment 95, filed by our team. We want to ensure that Article 1 of the Directive will encourage sustainable, fair and solidarity of water. I will briefly refer to the basic issues that the Spanish socialist group has a somewhat differentiated attitude about some positions in which others are arguing here. This is the case of water transport between river basins. We believe that it would be better for the future framework directive not to leave the Community supervision the possibility of implementing it. Given the hydrogeological characteristics of the Spanish state, where structural water transfers are carried out, we believe that the state principles must be those who decide on the resources of their own territory, which of course should always be taken on the basis of the criteria for compliance with cohesion. As for one of the most controversial issues in question, the issue of pricing, the Spanish Socialists insist on the view, based on respecting the principle of ""Pollution Payments"" that the Directive must propose pricing policies that respond to all levels of consumption. Impressed in the countries of Central and Northern Europe. The social, environmental and economic impact is particularly taken into account and the application is regulated on the basis of different geographical and climate conditions. We want to build a Europe with a sustainable and healthy environment. However, Europe of the environment cannot be built in any way based on multi -speed, but it must be built on the basis of solidarity. In), Mr President, the Ecological Disaster in the Danube reminds us how close all the countries of Europe are closely linked and how important water is to all of us. The rejections from the chemical factories in my constituency, in northwestern England, will end up on the beaches of mainland Europe. This clearly shows that we are interconnected."	el
"My urgent appeal is, and this is a point that has been repeatedly put in the resolutions: you can't consider the case of observers to Moloukas? Thousands of dead, thousands of injured, tens of thousands of refugees are enough! The second country, and I will briefly refer to it because Mr Ratten knows it very well, is Burma. We should not silence the situation in Burma. I have the impression that this country is slowly forgotten. For 10 years, there has been an elected president who has been under house arrest. Parliament has not been operating for 10 years. Numerous members of parliament have been murdered or escaped, while few remain in Burma. There are hundreds of thousands of refugees in Thailand and India, coming from Burma and, however, in this country the required attention does not seem to be paid. I think, and of course, in the context of the change in Indonesia, that Burma should also be included in the agenda. It is not possible for Ms. Aung San Sui Kyi to feel abandoned even by Europe. My request is, therefore, to put this country at a high position on the agenda. Mr President, Mr President of the Council, Mr Commissioner, the registration of the position of the European Union in the world cannot be established solely in economic power. One feature that distinguishes us is the systematic reference to human rights, either on our behalf or from those with whom we maintain relationships. The European Parliament has been the main pole of promotion and protection of human rights because it has managed to overcome the restrictions arising from national selfishness and the need to defend ""national interests"", a need that is sometimes reflected in the positions of the Member States, but also in the positions of Member States. That is why it allows us to declare, for example, that the European Parliament has never left the situation in the eastern Timor, which would offer the worst services in the case of finding a fair solution to the people of the area, which has always been opposed to Indonesian. This is also the reason why, once recently, we have expressed our opposition to arms sales in Indonesia, a position which, unfortunately, the Council did not convert. But it is not just enough to prevent appearance or put an end to heinous aggressive actions committed by individuals or organized bodies against the weaker ones. It is essential, once similar violations are noted, to ensure that the perpetrators do not go unpunished, whatever they are and wherever they are, in Indonesia or Angola, Cuba, China or Burma, whether they are politicians or military or military,Let's take care of the administration of justice in Indonesia. Let us ensure that there is justice in the Eastern Timor. President Wahid needs our help to cope with the difficult situation he is called upon to face. It is crucial that this resolution included an explicit reference to Eastern Timor, on the initiative of the EPP."	el
I will be particularly vigilant for the proper implementation of the specific problem of partnerships, the provisions of the General Regulation of Structural Funds. The third point is the need to develop the content of growth in jobs, although I know well, Mr Van Dam said it recently that primary responsibility is in the Member States, and when we speak of the responsibility of the Member States, such as the usefulness or effectiveness of this regional policy. In short, Mr Fruteau said that growth fruits were distributed unevenly. However, there must be growth and not everyone in a period of stagnation or recession, as has been the case in the past. You will tell me that growth or crisis is not the case with everyone. I agree with your analysis. It must be better distributed, however, what is even more difficult and more severely affecting the regions that are disadvantaged because of their remote position, the distinct or island regions, is the absence of growth, which has marked the two previous decades. The fourth point, which Mrs Hedkvist Petersen has just emphasized is the promotion of a policy of equal opportunities for women and young people. The fifth point is the importance and role of small and medium -sized enterprises, Mr Vatanen said it very strongly a while ago. Finally, the positive results for the national administrations of the structural funds management system, the incentives of employees in the management of the resources of these funds, despite their complexity sometimes, and the importance of further improving the evaluation, monitoring and control procedures. I inform the European Parliament that I intend to organize a seminar with national and regional authorities in the mid -2000s, regarding this issue of evaluating the procedures for the exchange of correct practices in managing structural funds. I would like to refer to some specific points. Mr Berend, you have expressed the desire to rapidly establish the distribution of zones. We complete the distribution in zones. Tomorrow, four new countries will be the decision of the Commission, and very soon, I hope, the Italian turn will come. Consequently, you will be satisfied at this point, since all the countries of target 2 will be formed into zones. Regarding the informal economy you mention in your report, I am well aware that the analysis and production of statistical data on this subject is based on the credibility of the data and, as Mr Cocilovo said, there is a problem of credibility. To some extent, the data is re -taken into account in the statistics on GDP, the workforce research, and in any case, I would like to point out the efforts it makes, and will continue to pay, Eurostat to improve the quality of statistics. Also mentioned, Mr Berend, like Mr Aparicio Sanchez, the absence of reform in the fishing sector. On the issue, which I am personally interested in, I will remind you that the small size of this area - which does not mean that it is negligible - and its concentration in a very small number of regions do not facilitate its analysis in a regional context.	el
"On the contrary, in the chapter on the plans for the strengthening and training of refugees, the report is settling in relation to the original text, provided that this measure no longer concerns refugees as refugees, but only ""refugees in the Geneva Convention"". This restriction is unacceptable at a time when, throughout Europe, numerous refugees are in a tragic condition, without protection, obliged to work in illegality and hide, while governments and police officers who call themselves democratically chase them. The first measure that is required to be taken in this area is to give these illegal immigrants the legal means to live decent and to be able to work without relegating to the state of Paria, to fall victim to employers without moral suspensions, and to have numerous government and police officers. I voted in favor of Mrs Stenzel's report on the Equal initiative, because I find it essential to continue the work that began in the context of previous now, Horizon, Youthstart and Integra plans of Adapt initiatives and ""employment""? The lessons we obtained from these actions must be used as the foundations of progress. Equal means ""Equality"" (Equality). We need to see her come true. I applaud the proposed focus on promoting new ways of combating discrimination and all kinds of inequality in the labor market. I also support the desire to move away from the obsolete method and bring the partners together in search of innovative ways to deal with unemployment. There must be flexibility. I am deeply sorry for this initiative only limited funds. In the previous planning period, 9% of the structural funds were available for Community actions. The percentage is now 5.35%. This means that funds must be used to achieve the maximum result and information on successful partnerships must be widely and rapidly divided. The Employment and Social Affairs Committee has approved many of the amendments I have tabled, which concerned, for example, the emphasis to access initial funds for a business, how we would take advantage of new business opportunities in large and small cities, as well as in rural areas. This often meant that good plans did not lead to real employment opportunities. The positive experience of the innovative actions of the small organizers was at risk due to their remote position from the process of this policy. I also emphasized the need for prevention. The participation of the social partners also needs to be emphasized. There must be flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced and even priority. There should also be flexibility for countries with low budgets. Although there are some aspects of the report that I think would be better treated in a different way, I think that the exhibition overall offers a flexible and rational approach and must be supported. With this Equal Community Initiative, the Commission seeks to replace Community initiatives ""Employment"" and ADAPT, as well as various sub -programs promoted under this sector: ""Now"" (new opportunities for women), ""Horizon"" (for people with disabilities), ""Youthstart"" (Youth """"Integra"" (for groups threatened by social exclusion), all with the aggravating element, that it is substantially cut in the available financial credit."	el
In Europe, after the Amoko Cadiz or Urquiola on the Spanish coasts in 1976 or the Torrey Canyon in the same year or so many other cases, we really started with corresponding legislation from 1994 and 1995 and especially in the past few years.In addition, in the past few years, the security of passenger traffic was generally concentrated.That is the reality.In my opinion, huge effort must now be made in order to tackle the new problems that are also derived from North American legislation, whereby the safety of the sea transport of dangerous goods must be in the foreground.I have addressed a number of questions that we can treat it in more detail, if you want it in more detail and more precisely in a meeting with the committee responsible for this topic or then if I will introduce you to the specific initiatives in the coming months.My declared intention is that we will start the discussion from the end of March, which also coincides with the Council of Ministers, and that of course we already have texts about which we can discuss before the end of the half year of the Portuguese presidency.The cheap flags are a problem, but not the only one.Romania is not a cheap flag, and yet it has a very high index of events in inspections.More than the cheap flags.Malta and Cyprus have applied for their admission to the community.We have to make our demands on this question and this is negotiated.This will force us to reconsider the registers of the European Union and to address the famous problem, which will surely reappear, the demand for a community register.I think this is difficult, but in any case the registers of the countries of the European Union have to be checked.With regard to the controls, a high -level key question, as Mr. Hatzidakis said, we first have to check how the legislation works that we already have.Because we already have legislation.According to the information provided by the Commission's services, this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to lack of personnel, funds and inspectors.The problem is not that only 25 % are checked, but how the selection is made, how the ships are determined with the greatest risk: after the age of the ships or after the risk history of the flags.Unfortunately, the 25 % are sometimes covered by flags, of which you know that they will meet all the requirements: the inspections go faster and the work is easier to do.Therefore, it will be less about making changes than taking measures to control what is already done, apart from some complementary claims in relation to revisions, especially depending on the age of the different ships.In addition, there are Solas (international convention to protect human life at sea) and marble (international convention to prevent marine pollution by ships), two Convention of the International Sea Consumption Organization, which must be made mandatory in all countries of the Union and their application must be checked.With regard to the question of the inspectors of the Union, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies that these inspections are carried out by the Member States, which should not mean that the Commission does not have to control whether the states correctly perform their task correctly.	de
We could not agree with such a decision, which questioned the powers of the European Parliament. A second conciliation allowed the increase of EUR 1.1 million to reach the 77 million compromise. Despite an increase of 3 million in relation to the original proposal, I personally disapprove of once again the fact that the fiscal media does not respond to the ambitions manifested and that the care of the Council demonstrated in this case is in full contradiction with its statements in favor of its security and security statements. However, renewable energy sources are an indisputable means of achieving these goals. However, despite the reservations I expressed on the low level of overall funding, I personally support the compromise because of the content of the program, content in which the European Parliament has contributed actively, as after the entry into force of the Amsterdam Treaty, this sector falls under the process. It is almost certain that with all the proposed measures and actions, we will probably be able to approach the 12% of renewable energy sources in 2010, that is, their doubling, if they are accompanied by all credit, including state. This program, together with the Save II program, with the integration of the environmental dimension into energy policy, thus lays the foundations of a real Community strategy to achieve pure forms of energy while reducing our dependence. In conclusion, Mr President, I would also like to emphasize that in addition to the proposed measures, there must also be legislative measures and, in particular, similar budgets that accompany these political wills. And I end, of course, congratulating Mr. Langen, our rapporteur, on his work, as well as all the members of the Committee and the Committee of Conciliation. Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I would first of all, I would like to express my satisfaction with the agreement reached on the Altener II program in the Commission Committee and to prescribe with the statements made by the various speakers, and of course, to point out that this agreement will be included in the program. All of this will ensure greater coordination, transparency and efficiency in our energy programs, which should also include the Save program, which we are going to discuss shortly. I would like to say that the work done all this time by Parliament was of high quality, and in this sense I congratulate the rapporteur Mr. Langen as well as the various speakers who intervened both in the Commission and here, in plenary. Obviously there were discussions, we had to resort to the reconciliation process, as the rapporteur and Mr Caudron reported, since no results were achieved at the first meeting, and a second meeting was needed, despite the fact that the amounts were not excessive. But in the end, I believe that we have achieved a rational agreement that, as everyone may not be perfect, but I personally believe that it allows to boost the plans we had in our hands.	el
"As far as parliamentary negotiation is concerned, I would like to reiterate my gratitude to all those who acted and intervened, primarily to the rapporteur, because the proposal accepted by the Council was incorporated by the majority of the amendments to Parliament, in this case, in this case,credits. Improvement with hot money was achieved, as we say nowadays and was achieved by preserving the rights and responsibilities of this Parliament. As for the committee in this organizing game, I think it is always important and it is very satisfied with that I point it out. I reiterate my gratitude to all those who intervened, especially to the Vice -President, Mr. Provan, for his brilliant attitude throughout this debate mainly during the conciliation process, to the Chairman of the Industry Committee, and also to the rapporteur, and to the rapporteur. Thanks, Mrs. Commissioner. The discussion ended. The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00. Culture 2000 The daily provision provides for the discussion of the Report (A5-0009/2000) by Mr. Graaa Moura, on behalf of the European Parliament Delegation to the Commission Committee on the Committee on Committee on Committee on the European Parliament and the Council for the establishment of a Council""Culture 2000"") (C50327/1999 - 1998/0169 (COD)) Madam President, I basically thought we had nothing else to say, since we had all said in the last discussion. Unfortunately, however, nothing has changed that the Council always talks about culture but does not have the corresponding funds. We have the feeling or perhaps we are convinced that the Member States would gladly delete what was written in 1992 in the Maastricht Treaty, since no one really wants to allocate funds for culture. Unfortunately things are this and we have to point out. I would like to thank the rapporteur for really working tirelessly to process this truly difficult issue in collaboration with the Mrs. Commissioner. What we have had to see is, of course, that we have achieved our purpose in terms of content, but not in terms of funding. In such a reconciliation process, where one must really achieve unanimity, one has the impression that it is completely weak. Basically the bazaar is not fair. There are always people where they have the opportunity to reject everything and on the other hand we are in and praise a little more money for culture. Basically it is degrading what we do there. It is an awesome Arab bazaar with unequal conditions. We are happy, however, that the program was done as we wanted it. It corresponds to what people expect from us. We support small and medium -sized but not big events and allow each citizen but also to smaller actors to have easier access. I believe that the fact that culture is today with education and youth in the hands of a single Commissioner also provides more complicity among these three programs that specifically concern citizens in the European Union."	el
When the contracts come into force and what final form they will have depends on the implementation also depends on the implementation by the contracting parties.In the United States, the WIPO contract has already achieved legal force in the form of the digital Millenium Corporate Act, whereby this legislative measure has managed to maintain the delicate balance in the sense of the WIPO.The EU must also make progress in accordance with the agreements made in the WIPO.It is also questionable that the statements adopted by the previous parliament do not support the balanced WIPO system.The statement in the first reading of the copyright guideline had a inclination and the balance was shifted in a manner that was disadvantageous for Europe.The proposed recommendations do not promote the position of culture in Europe, on the contrary.Rather, the changes brought in by Parliament improve the possibilities of the media groups established on the existing market to put their old market shares of over 80 % by rigid and oversized copyright regulations in a new framework.So I am not talking about the recommendation of Charlotte Cederschiöld, which I think is an excellent document, but of the treatment of the topic copyrights by the last parliament.In particular, I would also like to thank Ms. Cederschiöld to clearly define the concept of so -called intermediate storage in her report.In the WIPO contract, this type of reproduction has not been given a conscious position.If these technical copies are subject to protection, the data transmissions - as is rightly stated in the recommendation - are more expensive and complicated.This is as if a postman would have to pay a license fee if he has a book to read the consumer.The actual advantage of culture is to be able to bring art and knowledge safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.The new activity environment is above all a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.It is essential to take into account the interests of all parties.The parliament tried to meet this aspect in its recommendation.President!First of all my compliment to the rapporteur for the work she did.According to the Commission, she worked quickly and precisely.That is not unimportant.The Commission would like to express its recognition to the rapporteur.Right from the start, I would like to say that the Commission agrees with the conclusions in the draft of a recommendation and therefore agrees to ratification by the parliament.I would like to highlight the importance of both contracts.With the Wipo consulting law contract and the WIPO contract for performances and recordings, we make progress in the international protection of copyrights and the related rights and thus a significant improvement in the Bern agreement and the Roman contracts.Both contracts contribute to better protection of works and other things, but enable the public to access the content offered in the networks.The two contracts expressly allow the community to become a contracting party and to have a say in the control in this area.The consent of the community to the contracts is of crucial importance because it shows how much it is due to intellectual property rights.	de
Unfortunately, nothing changes and nothing will change. Suggest the repair of evil with evil and the application of the same devastating methods, as well as the same economic principles in areas that have so far escaped: in education, in wage policy, in direct taxation, the right to work, in social protection and social assistance. The most bizarre in all of this is that this social sector downgrade policy was largely performed by leftist governments of various shades - pink, red, green - which proclaim social justice during the election campaign, but organize the general social downgrade. I want to reiterate here our belief that no social policy is not possible or a full -time policy without national and European preference, and without protecting our markets from fierce global competition. It is our obligation to first think of Europeans in terms of employment, social protection, family policy, retirement policy. The globalization of the economy you invoke is neither necessary nor fatal. This globalization is forcibly required by the only superpower that has survived the Cold War and by multinational companies that have become autonomous economic forces that submit to their economic will, nations and peoples that are quite unable to resist. Therefore, you are complicit for this evolution. Encourage it, work with it, and in fact organize, despite your seemingly announcements, the dissolution of our social protection systems, uncertainty and social degradation. The European Social Model is in danger of failing to withstand this globalization of the economy, mainly in the form it takes today, which is being carried out without taking into account either the social or the nationalities of the states. Thus, your ultra -liberal escape is certainly not the solution to social problems, uncertainty and employment problems of tens of millions of Europeans. Mr President, the result of the Lisbon Summit will be a collection of fine words. Words welcome, but the main problem is that we have an economic and monetary union that is most interested in combating inflation than employment. The central bank said price rise should always remain below 2%. The stability pact says that the budget deficit must be the maximum 1% in an ordinary year. There is no requirement, however, unemployment is maintained below 5% or - even better - below 2 or 1% only the price of money should not go up, only public spending should not be increased. One could think that a country wants to limit unemployment that plagues its population with public investment, but this is prohibited. It is more important to maintain financial policy as a sacred cow than to find jobs for the unemployed. Personally, I find it more important to take into account the economy of each family and to assure that Familia returns home with a salary instead of a dismissal, and that was precisely the view of the Danish government that ascended power in 1993.	el
The Commission must decide whether the matter is considered to be expired or whether it should appeal to the European Court of Justice. My answer may not be satisfactory right now, but I would like to assure the MP that the Commission will make the decision in a few weeks. I seek the MP for this short delay in the committee's decision. Mr Commissioner, you have some reason for public health reasons to have a different tax rate eg. In the Scottish whiskey and in French wine Bordeaux or even in my colleague's Bavarian beer? Can you consider the application of an equal tax base for alcoholic beverages in Europe?((()) The issue of the special tax consumption tax, which is mentioned by the honorable MP, is the sole right of the Member State concerned. The Commission does not have any means to impose any reduction or increase in special taxes on alcoholic products or any other products. Towards the end of this year, the Commission will submit a report on the differences in specific consumption taxes between the Member States. There will undoubtedly be discussed with Parliament and the Council on the present situation, which shows that there are many differences in the rates of special taxes between the Member States. For example - I think the honorable MP referred to it - no special tax on wine in France is imposed while imposed in the United Kingdom. This leads to distortion of the internal market because the wine is illegally transported from France to the United Kingdom. The question specifically refers to the relationship between special consumption taxes and the alcohol content of the products subject to those taxes. The committee does not have a means of influence here. In the case of Sweden, the excise duty is actually used as a means of limiting alcohol consumption. Although this leads to differences in specific consumption taxes between Sweden and the other Member States of the Union - and this in itself increases the cross -border smuggling of alcoholic products - is a legal means of limiting alcohol consumption. There is natural demand elasticity, in this case of demand flexibility. I'm not exactly sure how big it is, but it is not zero, and therefore it has to have some effect. My question would be almost the same as the question asked by Mr Purvis, but I would like to expand even more on the subject. Indeed, as you say, excise duties are the sole right of the Member States, but the use of this right in a manner bias against producers in one part of the community against the rest may also be contrary to the principle of the single market. For example, if we take into account what Mr Purvis and I think, the whiskey of mallain produced by some areas of the Highlands - a very remote region of Europe, economically very weak, where a whole rural community, as well as a community living in distillation -or Danish Aquavit than my alcohol or wine seems biased and biased use of a medium that is admittedly exclusively right for Member States.	el
This is certainly the best boost we can give to democracy in Europe.If, in this way, we abandon the culture of the fifties to engage in the new century, we can say that we have experienced a very beautiful moment.Mr. President, I first address my congratulations to Michiel Van Hulten for his first report.It was a famous hazing but, as popular wisdom says, the best way to learn to swim is to throw yourself immediately.Dear colleague, after such an event, I think you can qualify for the Olympic Games!In my opinion, two points deserve the particular attention of my group.First, there is the individual responsibility of the commissioners.This point must be set at the intergovernmental conference.We certainly do not want this important question to be left to the entire discretion of the council.Consequently, we have filed an amendment in which we ask if it would not be possible to conclude an agreement between the Commission and the Parliament so that we have a kind of retirement position rather than leaving our fate in the hands of the Council.The second point that my colleague, Mr. Mulder, has already mentioned, is that, according to the European Party of Liberals Democrats and Reformers, the Parliament should also be examined by independent experts.This would contribute enormously to the restoration of the confidence of European citizens in our institution.We can only be both an opponent and a credible partner of the reformed commission that if we recognize our wrongs and if we put on order inside the European Parliament.It is only by reforming all of the European institutions that we will obtain from democratic, dynamic and transparent Europe that our fellow citizens deserve.Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate my colleague Van Hulten at the first work he presents in the Assembly.I am convinced that it will serve him, among other things, so that his second report gains flexibility and for him to seek to reach a greater consensus between the different groups.Now, the Commission reform process claimed by citizens cannot be postponed.This parliament has heard many occasions, including on the part of the Presidents of the Commission, the wish that it is reformed.It now seems that it becomes more serious.After the resignation of a commission and the demonstration of an almost unlimited number of inadequacies by an expert committee, the promise made by Mr. Prodi on September 14 to present before this assembly a complete reform project for the month of February is logical.Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform program.The report that we are now debating is trying to give a political force to a good part of the recommendations of the Expert Committee charged by this Parliament.Mr. Prodi said that in any case he would act, that he would of course prefer to succeed, but that the fear of not reaching his goal would not prevent him from acting.Therefore, we ask that his program be courageous, because, if this is the case, I can assure him that Parliament will be on the side of the Commission in this reform process.	fr
Citizens' political rights and human rights of all individuals should also be included and fundamental rights should be clarified before the new dangers. A list of fundamental rights recognized by European institutions as binding shows the citizens and the duties they must maintain. It is a political and legal space and a place of freedom, not only economic, but also of security and justice in a huge territorial extent that has previously experienced bloody conflicts in periods. A field of enemy armies conflict throughout the first half of the century, Europe today guarantees peace and freedom from fear and poverty. So we have to understand the map of fundamental rights, and no one has any reasonable reasons to express fears when consolidating the supremacy of law over power. Author of the Opinion of the Committee on Legal Issues and Internal Market.(Sv) Madam President, dear colleagues, Europe has been structured on fundamental rights. The same is true of the American Constitution, which is more specifically founded in our European fundamental rights, the material of John Lock's ideas and the French Revolution. US citizens may demand that our European rights be satisfied in their courts, which results in pride, self -awareness and capacity for them. Fundamental rights can create an identity and the feeling of belonging to a community. They can also help individuals exploit the opportunities that are now being created in Europe with the free movement, euro and information technology, that is, the capabilities created in the new economy. It is easier to safeguard and accept cultural differences, our European property, if citizens know that they can require their rights to be satisfied throughout the territory of the Union, because free circulation is required for guaranteed, fundamental rights. An enlargement without guaranteed rights could even lead to failure and delay our economic growth. The binding regulatory framework is a non -negotiable term and a necessity of a constitution that is absolutely essential. I would like to address a warning on the signing of the Council of Europe Convention, especially if it is done without being accompanied by a binding regulatory framework. These complications must be studied with more care. I hope to obtain a modernized wording of Article 6 of the Council of Europe Convention, which will summarize and concentrate the rights we already have, to which modern biotechnology and data protection will also be added. The regulatory framework should be easily announced to the citizens as well as it is clear to them. Should not be ambiguous or contain a plethora of referrals. The regulatory framework should be binding and include the European institutions. It cannot be reasonable to leave citizens unprotected in violations made by institutions that are of police authorities, such asOLAF and Europol! This venture makes European citizens stronger. Madam President, as an author of an opinion of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee, I would mainly like to focus my attention on the point of fundamental social rights.	el
"If you raise all the money and generates synergies, then it can be a bit happy, but only a little. I wish us to have these few funds we will be able to have many results. Madam President, I agree with the wonderful words that the rapporteur began his speech and I have to add that during the conciliation I felt a little personal frustration with the Council. On the one hand, he continued to refuse to accept the term ""European Cultural Policy"" or the like, even downgrading what is written in the circumstances, and defines ""Culture 2000"" exclusively as a means of cultural cooperation and accepts nothing more. On the other hand, it has kept complete intolerance to the funding requested by this parliament, funding that was already minimal. Now, of course, the last thing I said would be unfair to the fourteen members of the Council, since only one, the Netherlands, was the protagonist of this intolerance. It has again proved that the conciliation is incompatible with the requirement of unanimity in the Council. This requirement makes it almost impossible to agree and even offend the dignity of the parliamentary institution. Madam President, these thoughts should not hide, however, the fact that with the common text we will vote for tomorrow - the Socialists will vote in favor - one of the most important programs of the European Union is activated. Acting on cultural issues, we immediately build the soul of the Union and more in this case, where the sub -programs that constitute ""Culture 2000"" are amazing. In recent years, one of the most acceptable programs have been among the most active and new citizens of the European Union. Finally, I would like to mention the deep human impression made by the rapporteur, Mr. Graaa Moura: his knowledge, his moderation, his educational infrastructure characterizes him, in my opinion, as the best rapporteur to have this report. Congratulations! Finally, I would like to congratulate Commissioner Reding, Vice President Mr. Imbeni and Mr Gargani, chairman of the Culture Committee, for the stable and prudent attitude that, according to his role, kept throughout the conciliation.-Ten Holte (Eldr).(NL) Madam President, Madam Commissioner, Mr Rapporteur, I would like to start congratulating Mr. Graea Moura on his enormous contribution to the examination of the ""Culture 2000"" program. It has been said before - and on this subject we have discussed in many cases - that culture is of course very important not only as an autonomous sector - and I would like to emphasize it once again - but also as a exclusive means of spreading European idea and European culture. We must not forget this. The European radiation of this program leads to too many activities, especially for the areas of less common languages, such as the Netherlands, where the state offers opportunities but also needs the program's support due to the language spoken there. Today we have finished a long course. I would like to go into the unclear for a while, as others did, and - above all - unwanted process."	el
According to the Commission, the convent responsible for the development of the fundamental rights chart must take into account the task that is given to him by the European Council of Cologne.However, this does not mean that the convention would have to limit itself to a codifying function existing in different sources.As I already had the opportunity to carry out this parliament, the Commission is convinced that the convent may have to be able to adapt and develop these rights taking into account current circumstances, in particular technical and social development.In view of the mandate and the final purpose of the text to be presented by the head of state and government, however, this option must be used with caution and only in case.The rights awarded with this charter apply to at least two groups of people.Part of everyone in the area of ​​the Union benefits from the Union in the area of ​​the Union, only the Union citizens.It is also conceivable that certain economic and social rights are granted only Union citizens and, under certain conditions, nationals are granted by third countries.At the present time, since the process of developing the Charter is still at the very beginning, it is still premature to want to go into more detail on the content of the charter.However, it is clear that the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women will certainly be one of the rights guaranteed by the future fundamental rights chart of the Union, since it is already included in the EU contract and the derived law and is undoubtedly one of the joint constitutional traditions of the Member States.As I have already presented before this parliament, the Commission is to include this charter in the contract.However, it is aware that the final decision is the responsibility of the state and heads of government.The not easy task of the convention is therefore to develop an ambitious and politically significant text, which can easily be included in the contracts.In its statement on the convening of a government conference to change the contracts, the Commission points out that the European Council must decide on the admission of certain topics in the agenda of the government conference in the course of 2000, including the fundamental rights chart of the European Union.Mr. Commissioner, it is extremely important that the citizens of Europe, men and women, are called up at the beginning of this new century to re -determine their rights and duties.We hope that the significant decision of the Cologne Council will really be fulfilled with life.The globalization on the one hand and the expansion on the other hand make the fixing of these rights only appear more urgent.Seattle has given the reason to seriously think about many related problems, and hopefully the European Council of Nice will not come together for nothing.However, in order to ensure the participation of the citizens in this new project, we would like to know which plan the European organs, specifically the European Commission, proposes for the social and democratic model of the Europe of the 21st century.I have heard something about her general line and now I would like to ask which space is intended for the children as an independent individuals in this project of the European Commission for a new social model of the 21st century.Mr President, Mrs. MP, I have to tell you very clearly that in my opinion and according to the statements of the President President President President from this morning, the development of the Charter is a politically very important process because he shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of its citizens on all other political concerns for the future of our joint project.	de
At that time, the interpreter of the general emotion in the face of the disastrous consequences of this disaster, the Council expressed its concern about the security of the oil tankers and the protection of the environment which must be associated with it.The council was not insensitive to this type of question and the need to take additional measures in this area.The importance for the Council to take new measures on the community level, and as part of its own work with international organizations, was highlighted at the time.As you know, in the current state, community legislation obliges the port authorities to perform inspections on board all foreign ships, including those who beat complacency, and immobilize them in the event that they do not meet international standards.There is a 1995 directive in this area.With regard to the future, the Council noted that the current reflection process at the level of the Commission will soon lead to communication on the security of oil tankers and to new proposals aimed at strengthening controls, as well as qualifications for inspection organizations.It is also planned to strengthen the structures of oil tankers who frequent community ports.These files are followed by the Council of Ministers of Transport and I can assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will grant the greatest priority to the proposals that the Commission will present in this area, in all likelihood.This seems essential to us in terms of environmental protection.Of course Parliament will be called upon to also decide on these proposals, since these are materials subject to codecision.I am delighted that the council reflect on this question.The chairman of the council is from a country, Portugal, which is directly threatened by a situation of this kind.If we think too much, by next summer, an oil tanker subject to such conditions could very well sink off the coasts of the Algarve, destroy the Portuguese tourism industry of the summer and, with a little luck, the sea currents could take this pollution to the island of Madeira - because they follow this direction - and, in addition, also destroyingCanaries.Does the president of the council not believe that we must stop thinking and start to take draconian measures in this area, taking into account that today we already have the means necessary to control this type of oil trees on the high seas?In any case, the history of Erika is a story that seems comical.A French boat, beating Maltese pavilion, with an Indian crew, with a navigation certificate issued by Italy, Sicily, and the last inspection of which was, I think, carried out in Bulgaria.The boat was flowing, the captain saw him well and knew that he would not even come to the nearest port.I think it should not be allowed.The damage can be catastrophic for your country, Mr. President, and for mine too, Spain.	fr
Peace to their soul.(Strong applause) Mr President, on behalf of the European People's Party and the European Democratic group, I would like to convey the Basque Fernando Bulesa representative and the Basque police Jorge Díez families, the most sincere solidarity demonstration, which is naturally conveying to the Basque Socialist Party. Mr President, unfortunately we have to talk about European extremist movements recently in Parliament. Their names are irrelevant, because in the end, they are all just the different manifestations of the same thing. In the face of all these extremes, we Democrats cannot surrender to peace, which is achieved by killing people;On the contrary, we have to gain strength from being aware that the only existing distortion in the society in the Basque Country is the gap that separates those who kill and their supporters and understanders, and the enormous majority of the huge Basque people who just want to live in peace and free.(Strong applause) Mr President, Good Members of the Parliament, on behalf of the liberal group, I have absolutely and decisively condemn a terrorist attack on February 22, in which Basque Basque Member of the Parliament and Socialist Horn, Fernando Buesa, and his security guard, Jorge díez, received. We repeat that in the rule of law of the European Union, it is possible to defend all opinions and all alternatives in so far as they are exposed to democratically, and when they comply with individual rights and the values ​​and principles of the Union on the basis of justice, economic and social development. Of course, the Union also does not allow violation of these principles, as clearly states in the establishment agreements. There is no way our society can accept a terrorist attack in which a member of the Basque Parliament and his security officers were killed. It is also a person whom the Basque society had chosen for his free will. We swear that these were the last victims in this process you said to be full of atrocities and that we find a way to guarantee the Basque people the opportunity to have a peaceful cohabitation. The Mr President, the European Connected Left Confederation Group/On behalf of the Nordic Green Left group, I want to regret this really insane and cruel bomb attack, which was made in the Basque Country, presents my mourning victims, and strongly condemned these acts that have long been done. One day, the terrorist organization ETA killed police;It then killed soldiers;It then placed a bomb in the department store and killed men, women and children;One day, it killed Lieutenant General Quintana Lacacin, who had defended democracy on February 23, on Madrid's streets;One day, it killed the horn of the People's Party, Gregory Ordóñez, in the city of San Sebastian;On the second day, Etan's terrorist went to the professor Francisco Tomás y Valiente's office and killed it completely cold -blooded, and first killed Lieutenant Colonel Blancon, the terrorists killed only a few days ago in low -minded Fernando Buesa, a memberDíezin, who served as a police officer in the autonomous region of the Basque Country. I want to say that those who kill, that is, the terrorist organization ETA, but also have to condemn those who support and understand these terrorist attacks. It is useless to ask these people and these organizations to choose the road of democracy overnight. We have to invoke society as a whole, especially democratic parties, regardless of whether they are national or nationalists, or how European-minded these are these side issues. Unfortunately, there are also organizations that are silent, people who are silent, and others who are just mourning those who are killed as if they were victims of a traffic accident. All of this has to be said very public here so that the sounds of all European Democrats can agree that in the Basque Country, it is now time to stop the distribution, stop retreating and stop killing.	fi
Thank you, Mrs. Commissioner, but what I would like to know is what the Commission is really doing so that the Member States do to create a real rail network in this Somport valley. Today work is actually being carried out on the road line. So we can ask ourselves about the future. As for me, I am afraid of actually creating a tourist train to thank some ecologists, and in this case we will stay there. However, some studies, such as that of Gretab, have actually been carried out, to indicate one, which shows that the cross-line crossing of the Somport-Pau-Ganfranc-Jaca neck could indeed allow the release of equal number of heavy vehicles with those that are currently using the Tunnel. Consequently, what we want, and what I would like to know, following the proposals made by Mr Lamoureux under the Transport Committee, which argued that the European Union would really prioritize the railways, is what you really intend to ask the Member States to make the same priority.- (ES) Mrs. Isler BiGuin, I want to tell you that we are trying to convince Member States in relation to the conversations and opinions that submit us on various issues and the studies that transmit us. But undoubtedly, as you know very well, as far as the railway line is concerned, we face difficulties with one of the border states. It is undisputed that the crossing of the large mountain ranges of the European Union creates problems. That is why in 1999 the Commission subsidized a study on the observation of the flows of goods transmitted by land and exchanges to the sensitive areas, namely the Pyrenees and the Alps, because the problems are largely similar. I would like to tell you that beyond that we seek to issue a relevant announcement - for the Pyrenees and the Alps - before the end of the year, proposing specific solutions. However, these solutions must be accepted by the Member States. And I would like to tell you that the conclusions about this study we are completing will also be taken into account in the revision of the directions on trans -European networks and, moreover, that the Interreg II program also funded the implementation of general studies with regard to the suitability and viability of a future centralized. Heavy goods. Based on the above, a MP, and as I have made it absolutely clear in some of my presentations to the Commission, I realize that a huge effort should be made to develop rail transport. We are facing a request that cannot be resolved by increasing roads and need to study a better use of rail infrastructure, an alternative that is not only more environmentally appropriate, but which, among other things, is an alternative that will allow some existing infrastructure to be used. In other cases, as in the particular case we are referring to, we have to create the infrastructure, but we are of course prepared to talk to the states - and do it - to see if we achieve a plan of this kind that allows a central rail axis in the Pyrenees.	el
I have not yet become aware of any arguments that the Commission should extend this deadline.Second, we keep constant contact with the Swedish government.I can tell Mr. Andersson that on Monday, March 6th I will travel to Stockholm to lead talks with Minister Ringholm, with MPs of the Swedish Parliament and, if necessary, with the Prime Minister or other ministers and to discuss this matter in more detail, which - I am completely aware of - wakes up enormous political desires in Sweden.Thirdly, I naturally understand what importance the health aspect is.I would like to repeat that Professor Lindgren from the University of Lund will remain constant in Sweden, as always, the import restrictions may work out.Then of course the question arises where the amounts of alcohol came from that are not introduced by travelers.It replies that this alcohol is smuggled or manufactured by the Swedes itself.I do not need to point out her, Mr. Andersson, how extremely dangerous and harmful to health this procedure is.Well, Mr. Andersson obviously thinks that the state of health will improve if we limit the import of alcohol.In this case, not only Sweden would have to, but all countries of the European Union would have to assume that they would be forbidden to sell alcohol.For this, the United States delivered an example.Mr. Andersson, the ban called prohibition at the time may be known.And he also knows how it affected the activities of the mafia in the United States, where the prohibition was ultimately lifted.With that I just want to say that you have to protect health, of course, but not with an alcohol ban, because that doesn't help.President!In reality, it is about the income from Swedish alcohol monopoly, and when the Swedish government says that it has to cover health costs, this is proof that it is a distortion of competition, because other countries have to finance their health costs themselves without having an alcohol monopoly.My question relates to whether you also know studies that the moderate consumption of alcohol of high quality, such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer, is even health -promoting, and therefore even relieving the Swedish state budget.If I understand Mr. Posselt correctly, he wants to go out to the fiscal aspects of this matter.As far as I know, the high taxes go back to alcohol -containing drinks in Sweden to 1638, and since then the state has moved its tax revenue to a considerable part from the sale of alcoholic beverages.As is well known, Sweden currently has the state monopoly, which in turn does not comply with EU law.Well, as far as the healing effects of alcohol is concerned - because that's what I think, Mr. Posselt, too - I can fully agree with him: in my opinion, a good bottle of wine can be extremely health -promoting and, even if you are in society, can definitely raise the mood.Perhaps Mr. Posselt, Mr. Andersson and my person can meet a glass of Aquavit at the bar of Parliament in the next few days.	de
These are the consequences of it!Therefore, we can only ask the Commission to continue to be soothing and to pay the recognition that are committed to continuing independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people and do everything to ensure that this people remain free and continue to behave in solidarity towards the other peoples.President, dear colleagues, the today's debate is all about hypocrisy: The Council dislikes the contract and uses a procedure that is absolutely not covered by Article 6 and 7, which enable a country to conduct a country in the event of serious and repeated injuries.In the present case, there are no serious and repeated injuries in Austria.There are risks - we are all aware of it - but at the moment there are absolutely no injuries, neither serious nor repeated.If the criteria of Article 6 and 7, the criteria of Copenhagen - compliance with the countries of Eastern Europe - were to be applied to our institutions, to the European Union, this European Union could not become a member with great certainty.When it comes to serious and repeated injuries, then we should perhaps mention certain Member States like Italy and France, the most common or most common in the Council of Court.We, dear colleagues from Belgium, should speak of the Dutroux affair, about the many children who have been kidnapped, displaced, raped and murdered by celebrities of this country, and always run in the seam.Dear colleagues, with a third of the MPs, we could force the council and the Commission to deal with it.We could ask ourselves why the Austrians defend themselves against a party rule that corrupted and spoil their country for ten or thirteen years, but which also spoils Italy, Belgium and other member countries of the Union and drives to corruption.We should really ask ourselves, dear colleagues, why 76 % of the Belgians have absolutely no confidence in the judiciary of their country, why 56 % of the French have absolutely no trust in their judiciary, why 53 % of Italians have absolutely no trust in their judiciary ... (The President deprives the speaker the word.) Ms. President, my parliamentary group, the EDD, and especially my party, feel very affected by this debate.We cannot support Mr. Haider's views and politics in any way.We regret his allusions to the Third Reich.But we also regret the fact that Parliament intends to interfere in the politics of a elected government of a country, especially if this country is part of the European Union.My party at home is certainly not racist, but we don't like to see it very much if the European Union makes us regulations or interferes.Will you get involved in the UK parliament when we are chosen?Mrs. President, the Austrian people, released his vote and chose Mr. Haider to his parliament.I think Mr. Haider gave 28 % of the votes;So there will be a coalition government.	de
"We not only regret the processes in Austria, we are agitated and deeply disappointed.We ask the ÖVP to ultimately check other solutions.We always come back to Article 6 of the Treaty.We are still fighting against the trivialization of the extreme right.If the coalition occurs, we appeal to our colleagues of the ÖVP, both in programs as well as with word and deed for the respect of the principles and values ​​that form the foundation of European integration.Austria faces great responsibility.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!It is obvious that in this parliament we agree in the rejection of Haider and his politics, but it is also also clear that we have different views in the question of how this policy can be combated most effectively.Did you ask yourself how this debate here and the explanation of the Council Presidency from last weekend in Austria?Have you once asked yourself whether we are also responsible for how the political situation in Austria is developing if we swing in here for the judgment?Did you ask yourself what happened if a colleague's wish were fulfilled and will be in Austria in the next few days?According to the agreement of all observers, Haider would become even stronger.Who can want this?Don't we have the responsibility of considering how we combat this policy?Europe is a community of law.The principles we are responsible include democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.It is part of the democracy requirement that you do not have to find election decisions well, but have to respect, and that is why we have to respect if the Austrians are decided in their politics for reasons.It is a question of the rule of law that the chairmanship does not comment as he did, in a way that contradicts the contract.It is a question of political cleverness not to isolate the ÖVP, but to support the ÖVP as a undoubtedly democratic, constitutional and proven European party in the fact that Austria remains a member of this European community as well, and therefore the ÖVP colleagues must have our support in this difficult situation, and isolation is absolutely the wrong way!(Applause) Mrs. President, at home, people say: ""A welsh needs three attempts"", and three times, as you can see in the course of this debate, I have expressed the wish to be able to go into briefly on this excellent and sometimes moving debate.First of all, on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission, I would like to thank the commission for the support and understanding that a whole series of MPs of this house has given the position of the Commission, which we have expressed in our explanation yesterday.Of course, I also have to react to the fact that in the course of the debate - and I use a few terms used - there was talk of ambiguity, complacency and the careful behavior of the Commission."	de
However, unfortunately, we do not have enough resources for the police forces - which are dependent on the involvement of Member States - to guarantee what we set our goal at the end of the war, that is, to build co -operation mechanisms between ethnic groups that guarantee enough safe conditions for all the population. Question # 3 (H-0027/00): Subject: NATO challenge to the war crime court human rights organizations, such as US Human Rights Watch, have collected significant evidence against NATO's crimes related to Kosovo and Serbian bombing, with the intention of lifting an action in the Hague's warfare. On the basis of these evidence, some of which have already been submitted to the Supreme Court, NATO is accused of serious violations of international human rights and thoughtful murder. In the Council's view, should such charges be made to the war crime court to deal with in a detailed legal investigation? In the event that the charges against NATO are dealt with in court, what is the Council's attitude towards the Secretary-General/the high representative of the common foreign and security policy, who at that time acted as National Secretary General of NATO? Is there a procedure that can be arrested from the office until the proceedings have been completed in court? Mr President, Member Alexandros Alavanos, gives rise to general reflection. The Council has already expressed its conviction on several occasions that it was definitely the end of the ongoing fan -like and irresponsible activities, which was also undeniably contrary to the UNIK's security -free resolutions, and therefore it was legitimate and necessary to resort to NATO's harsh activities. I understand that NATO's actions and their justification can be disagreed. In my country, different parliamentary groups also had different views on this issue. However, the situation was what was. In any case, the Council's position on this issue is very clear, as the Council believes that the purpose of the Atlantic Covenant's air war campaign was to end the humanitarian emergency caused by the Belgrade government in Kosovo. That goal was completely unequivocally manifested from the position of the Council of the Council, which was approved on April 8 in Luxembourg. It should also be pointed out that NATO's actions were not relying on the reasons, but that they were only implemented as a last resort after it had been obvious that the negotiating decision was no longer found and that the Belgrade authorities were currently concentrating their power to expel Kosovo Albanians from the country. The Member is certainly aware that, as he recently attended the NATO General Staff, General Prosecutor Del Ponte emphasized that the International Court is obliged to investigate all the charges, including those presented by Canadian Pasifist groups against NATO. However, I have a statement from the general prosecutor here stating that there is currently no investigation into NATO's issues in the International Criminal Court, and that NATO's actions in Kosovo's conflict have not even begun a formal investigation. The general prosecutor has registered all messages from individuals and groups asking for an investigation into NATO's actions during the Kosovo conflict. Of course, the prosecutor will become familiar with all relevant prosecutions and, in due course, indicate whether or not they are given a matter of action. For the time being, the prosecutor has seen not to undertake a criminal investigation into the charges against NATO. I thank the chairman of the Council, but I do not agree with him that NATO's intervention was to stop a human disaster, because there is currently a human disaster in Kosovo, Miloeviæ's hell has been replaced by UCT and NATO's hell. Probably the chairmen of the Council has also noticed that almost half of the questions discussed today are about Kosovo. And the council chairman also admitted that after the action of Canadian and other peace organizations, the issue of dealing with NATO's activities in the war crime court is open.	fi
Mr President, however, these observations should not be covered by the fact that this text to be voted tomorrow will we socialists will vote for it one of the most important programs of the European Union. By acting in the field of culture, we contribute directly to the construction of the soul of Europe, and especially in this case, as the sub -programs included in the Culture 2000 are absolutely wonderful. In recent years, they have been among the programs that have been most popular with the European Union's most dynamic and youngest citizens. Finally, I want to say that the rapporteur Graça Moura made a deep human impression on me: his knowledge, his prudence, and his intellectual talent make him the best possible rapporteur who could have had this report. Congratulations! Finally, I would like to congratulate the Commission member Reding, Vice -President Impen, and Gargan, Chairman of the Cultural Committee, for the steadfastness and wisdom each of them has shown throughout the mediation procedure. The Mr President, the Member of the Commission, the Mr. Mr. Mr., I would like to start with Graça Moura for his enormous investment during this Culture 2000 processing. It was said before - and we have also discussed many times - that culture is, of course, very important as an independent area - I want to emphasize this once - but also as an excellent tool to take the European idea further, and culture is a very important thing for citizens. Under no circumstances should we forget it. The European incentive, which is included in this program, is of enormous importance, especially for small language areas, such as the Netherlands, where there is not only national potential, but where support is also needed, especially for language. We have come to the end of a long way today. However, I still want to deal with, as others have done, unclear and, above all, an unwanted procedure. The joint decision procedure and consensus are at odds with each other as if the snake ate himself at the other end. There is not much to negotiate if one party states in advance that we can negotiate everything, but the budget will remain the same. However, now I want to say that with regard to the Netherlands, this issue has been negotiated at an earlier stage. The result was an increase of 30 %, so we are not much dissatisfied with the result. Of course, it is always better - I always speak for it - give more money to use and also in a slightly faster way. However, I think this program offers good opportunities for many programs. I would like to emphasize that culture is not supported only from these budget. Culture is not just a matter of culture but also under many other areas. Structural funds also have a lot of money to use for culture, and we also need to take it into account and follow it closely. Fortunately, I am a member of the Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee. I'm going to control there that this issue will also be sufficiently discussed. In my opinion, we have also decided to accept that the budget is sufficient because it is a bad thing for citizens if it is not accepted. I have also always supported the rapporteur. However, I think it is necessary - even the rapporteur says - that the upcoming HVK will change the joint decision procedure so that no consensus is needed. We are very positive about many improvements. No more giant projects are needed, but space for cultural networks, a lot of attention to promoting reading, translating and translator centers, which is certainly important for small language areas. I would like to warmly thank the presenter and also Reding for the Culture 2000 program. I can still say that we are now working. Mr President, other colleagues have already dealt with what I was going to say, and I think the European Parliament groups are unanimous, as are the members of the Committee of Culture.	fi
It would be much better if we had tried to come up with some compromises and express a common vision. I believe that the European Parliament in this way is self -evident from the debate, at the moment when an extremely interesting development is being made in the European Union, as it is more and more clearly defined by a socio -economic program of action and wider plans. The Portuguese Presidency presented these wider plans during the preparations of the Extraordinary Lisbon Summit. The committee did the same in its five -year plans referring to one of the four priorities. But also the Commission's document, which was submitted in the context of discussions on the preparation of the Lisbon Summit, follows in turn a wide approach to many different areas. I consider these developments positive for the European Union, as I see a widely socio -economic approach to be more and more clearly shaped. I believe that the European Parliament will only be able to play a limited role in Lisbon, but we also have the June forum in which we have been invited. But what positions will we project there? Should we go and say that we remain in the political confrontations of the past? Mr President, ladies and gentlemen. I want to congratulate the body for the work done first. I believe that work was done with serious and in -depth. It is a fact that expert committees and discussions at the committees level have allowed us to receive high quality additional information. It is also a fact that throughout the debate this afternoon we were able to perceive significant disagreements about possible policies. Nevertheless, I also think I find some consent. I believe that we all agree that the economic situation at this stage is positive. We agree to try to move forward and take this phase to improve the circumstances, to achieve a clear improvement in employment. In relation to these issues I would like to make a short comment to focus on the last point, which I think is the essential in today's debate. Yesterday - some of you already mentioned it - The Economic Policy Committee referred to the improvement of the state of the economy of Europe. At this stage we can consider that this improvement, which we have already highlighted in the prospects in November, can even give us better results than those originally provided. Increasing employment continues at a satisfactory pace. It is a fact that we believe that inflation, despite yesterday's numbers, is a matter to follow - we have touched about two percent in the last December numbers - but it is just as a fact that our creepy inflation points out that inflationary pressures are due to some of its highly personalized elements. When we submitted our report, we referred to the dangers that might be magnified. We have basically highlighted the possibility of dealing with difficulties in American growth, and therefore in other parts of the world and some rejuvenation of inflation. This element of inflation resurgence can be particularly decisive if it ultimately causes cost inflation, which is why we always talk about the need for political wages compatible with the nature of inflation we want to determine.	el
"Alien hatred and racism are rejected through education, work and social integration, and by paying attention to homes, health or social services, but we do not collapse into easy generalizations that requires precision and relevance. This ended with the speech of Hernández Mollar. This is where my speech begins, the Mr President. Comprehensive and basic civil rights, economic, social and political rights, which are fully secured in both the constitutional system and in the activities of the authorities, are one of the essential parts of modern Western civilization. Different rights and declarations that have first encouraged the history of European-American politics and then world politics are milestones that have been honored to the coexistence of mankind and have supported it from Christian values ​​and education to the current democratic ideal. The European Union has always kept respect for basic human rights as one of the pillars that inspire it and has written it for the outer magazine of its establishment. Unless respecting human rights were inseparable to our moral perception of society, the entire existence of the Union would lack meaningfulness, as in addition to the fact that 15 Member State citizens form a wide range of economic freedom, they want, above all, to be an example of the complete respect for these rights. However, in this stable and unobtrusive endeavor, you must remember legal punctuality and, above all, healthy reason. Citizens of non -Union states in our area must be treated equal to the nationals of Member States in the case of education, health care and social protection. In all of this, you have to fully respect their religious beliefs and the specific features of their cultures. Even the smallest forms of racism, intolerance or alien hatred must be eradicated with their roots in all Member States where they occur. However, the administrative status of a person in a Member State and the political position of the citizen are two different issues. Union citizens are in a political sense of the Union's citizens because they are citizens of a Member State, and they have a full political right to participate, and in particular the right to vote in the election, to stand in the election or to apply for a permanent post in public administration. Artificially created European citizenship, which may not require the citizenship of a Member State, a European citizenship that only hovers over the constitutions of the Union's Member States without a legal and stable political basis, and is gently gave to third -country passport holders, no matter how they reside in one of the Member States. The European Union must be generously and openly welcoming all people who will promote their overall well -being and who are seeking refuge from Soro and persecution through their efforts and work. However, full political citizenship must be acquired in the manner set out by the legal system of each Member State. In his famous presentation, ""Qu'est-CK'une Nation?""(What is a nation?) Ernest Renan warned us: ""Let us not reject the basic principle that a person is a rational and moral being rather than tied to a language, rather than a member of a breed, rather than a representative of a culture.""Many of the 20th century European tragedy was due to the forgotten advice of this wise advice. So let's refresh our memory as shown in Renan, but let's not collapse into nonsense and morally questionable excesses. Mr President, I would like to express my appreciation for colleague Belder's report. I want to talk about it today. The report highlights many essential things. Indeed, there are many because racism and discrimination require a lot of attention in candidate states. I hope that EU candidate states work on the recommendations that are included in this report. I hope that our future partners, the candidate states, are also urgently related to a joint action program against discrimination, which will soon be discussed in this Parliament. However, I want to focus on the situation of the Roma in my speech. They are also called Gypsies. Many Roma live in candidate states in really miserable conditions."	fi
The second check group causes more problems for the Commission and thus does not support them: the Commission does not support the revision of 9 - coordination with local parties, as stated in the report - not because it disagrees with its principle, but because that article is related to the establishment agreement. The revision 12 proposes to increase the value of the project proposals from the Council from EUR 2 million to EUR 5 million. As most projects are already less than EUR 2 million, this review is not appropriate. In addition, we are concerned that approval of the review will lead to the mediation process. Therefore, the Commission does not support it. Reviews and market entry checks - checks 13 and 14 - would marked deviations from standardized and carefully agreed wording. In any case, as in the case of bank collateral, it is not appropriate to resolve such matters contained in specific regulations, but rather in a multidisciplinary way. We are opposed to the revision 15, which concerns the establishment of the Environmental Control Unit, as this is, in our opinion, a matter of internal organization that should not be resolved by decree. In fact, such a unit is already in operation, even though we are going to further strengthen it. Finally, we do not support the check 17 because it does not comply with the usual rules or wording of the regulations and consider it unnecessary. Much thanks, Member of the Commission! The discussion has ended. The vote will be delivered tomorrow at 12 noon. If the rapporteur hopes to postpone the processing, I ask him to apply for it during the voting lesson. According to officials, this is possible then. The following is the recommendation of the Bouwam Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism Committee for another processing (A5-0043/2000) ... (Bouwman to interrupt the President.) Bouwman.(De) Mr President, here's a mistake now! First there is another report. I'd love to talk about now, but before I have another report. Speaker. Many thanks, a good colleague, I knew as soon as the conversation started, why I was so happy to see you here in Parliament. I apologize, the documents have gone somehow. This is once again the bustle of the evening session. Forget what I've said so far. We will start again. The agenda on the agenda is the recommendation of the Committee on Development of Fernández Martín to provide the Commonwealth of the Council of the Council to provide measures to promote tropical and other forests in developing and sustainable care of the European Parliament and of the Council (EC)(12487/1/1999-C5-0014/2000-1999/0015 (COD))..(ES) Mr President, with this debate, we consulted the new authority of the Commission of Development in the joint decision procedure. The aim of the regulation we discuss today is to take action to promote and promote the necessary financial frameworks in developing tropical forests in developing countries to continue and promote the actions and projects, which were launched until the Decree of 1999 in force. 3062. With this financial instrument, the Union may comply with its obligations under the agreement on biological biodiversity, climate change and the convention of desertification. All of them states that it is necessary to support developing countries in solving their forest resources problems. Between 1990 and 1995, more than 56 million hectares of forest disappeared. This amount was unevenly distributed, but it was particularly affected by developing countries due to the increase in the area of ​​the crop, the construction of infrastructures or the natural disasters or fires. This is therefore not only a major problem that does not only concern developing countries, but on the entire globe and all living creatures there, and which Parliament gave his statement at the end of the last parliamentary term at the end of May 5, 1999. It was followed by a long negotiating process in the Council that only made a joint position in December 1999.	fi
"Additional recommendations as to this way of proceeding are also in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men.Likewise, the commission, through the voice of MM.Barnier and Vitorino, as well as certain Member States are resolutely favorable.I beg you, dear colleagues, to vote for this report adopted by a large majority by the Budget Control Commission.We can once again show that this Parliament is active to prevent mismanagement and, in particular, fraud and pronounce a conviction where it is necessary.Mr. President, I am happy to be able to express myself on this report and I congratulate Ms. Theato.I believe that this is a report where cooperation between the commissions has worked very well and the result, which reaches us today, is a sober and serene relationship on an extremely delicate material.Sobriety and serenity which are particularly necessary for the development of article 280.4.Because if we had to award a price for the most difficult article to understand, the least clear, the most confused whatever the name you want to give it, the competition would be, in doubt, very harsh when the treaty is a sampling of complex items, but it goes without saying that this article is a serious candidate at this price.This is also a particularly delicate question because it is, as Ms. Theato said, the protection of the financial interests of the community which is the game. We are all aware and this parliament is the first to have cared for the need to protect the financial interests of the community.But let's be careful and, as the French say: ""Let's not throw the baby with bath water"".In other words, it is necessary to respect, within the framework of the protection of the financial interests of the community, not only and Ms. Theato underlined, the powers of the national states, but also other points which concern citizens, which concern essential guarantees.The conclusions of the Theato report save them perfectly.Starting, as the president of the legal committee and the internal market and, of course, from the deputy, I hope that, tomorrow, this report will benefit from the support of the Parliament, to a large majority, and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.Mr. President, as Ms. Theato said, it is a critical relationship.It was proposed by the Budget Control Commission and it is an initiative report.One of the reasons why we ardently wanted to highlight this aspect was that the European Union, whether we like it or not, drags behind it a reputation for fraud and mismanagement, an exaggerated reputation, but it exists.We have to do something to remedy this situation.Some of the measures we have implemented in the past have not been respected by certain Member States - let's not forget that the Member States are responsible for the execution of some 80 % of the EU budget."	fr
I don't quite understand what the commissioner said.At this point, the vase leash in Stregrennan, added to the special protection zone at the commission's request, was completely destroyed.It is clear that the activities that took place at this location are in blatant offense with European directives.You say that there will be no subsequent funding.I would like to know if you hear, at this stage, to stop funding completely until a real investigation takes place.If not, why?If so, when will you do it exactly?Is it correct and indicated that the department which has the company is also the authority which issues the license as well as that which, at the base, perceives the funds from the EU and the reverse them to a company it has 100 %?Is it fair and well indicated?What is your opinion about it?It is necessary to put an end to any community funding of the project because it is in the blatant offense of the EU directives.Even the area designated by the commissioners as a special protection zone has been destroyed.Compensation afterwards will not repair the damage caused.The first legal challenge followed the start of the development of the port of the port, at the beginning of fall 1999, without having been implemented compensatory improvements in terms of housing.This resulted that the Irish authorities agreed to restore the elimination of the Spartina Anglica, but this time by mechanical means.The use of mechanical resources has brought an additional legal challenge - this is what I referred to in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical abduction would damage the vase leashes and would cause proliferation in the estuary of the Spartina Anglica, harmful on the environmental level.Currently, this legal challenge has not identified any conclusive result.The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is the responsibility of the national authorities and does not require any prior approval of the Commission.The role of the commission is to ensure full compliance with the standards required by the bird directive and it is clear that damaging compensatory measures as such would be a problem.In this case, the Commission proposes to request additional clarifications with the Irish authorities with regard to the most recent situation in terms of compensatory measures and the potential problems of the mechanical elimination of the Anglica Spartina.For the time being it is, we are not ready to offer the interruption of financing for structural funds.Mr. President, the specific case raised by Ms. McKenna is unfortunately not an isolated case.There are other examples of damage caused to the conservation of special scientific zones following EU funding.Will the Commission plan to transmit instructions to all member states stipulating that if, in the future, it discovers that European environmental directives have been infringed or that adequate environmental assessments have not been carried out, not only will interrupt any future funding but it will also withdraw the funds already allocated;In other words, it will claim the reimbursement of the sums paid to the Member States?Only such a measure will discourage this practice in the future.	fr
But what happens to vehicles that are already in the streets? Example: In the UK, Rover would be responsible for 5.8 million cars in the European Union if it was responsible for all its old cars and should immediately save EUR 250 million for recycling costs, while the Korean manufacturer who manufactures similar cars must reserve Panuts-Betrag. Competition is distorted in a way that has nothing to do with environmental protection, but that only affects investment ability and jobs that make cars here in Europe. Therefore, we propose that we form a fund for old vehicles, which will then be paid for the cost of recycling old cars to ensure the cost of cost. I can understand that colleagues from countries that do not make cars say that the manufacturers have to pay for everyone, and we are not interested in distorting the competition caused by reservations! However, I ask these colleagues to be solidarity with over 2 million people who make cars in Europe and make a living so that these jobs can be secured in the future. I am in favor of strict environmental requirements, you know about the connection of the Auto-Oil program and the exhaust limit for exhaust. However, I think the requirements must be the same for everyone! Mr President, a Member of the Commission and good colleagues, I think we need this directive, firstly, because it includes clear environmental objectives, and secondly, because this directive can encourage recycling, which is important. Third, it includes a clear procedure to prevent the pollution caused by heavy metals. It is also important. The Directive also provides a European framework for those Member States who already have a system and still want to use that system. First of all, we need to maintain the percentage of recycling, as this is naturally encouraged to encourage technical reforms and find ways to solve what is done for materials that we do not yet know what they need to do. Secondly, we need to keep the information as presented in a common position. The delivery of all cars must be free of charge since 2006, that is, free of charge to the last owner. It is, of course, very essential. No changes may be made to it. Is this too big a burden? However, there is one thing that we must not forget. The Directive applies to whole cars, or cars that do not lack any important parts. Experts say that whole cars are rarely worthless. Recycling and recycling spare parts is an industry that may not produce a loss, on the contrary, on the contrary, many companies live and deserve it well. This Directive encourages the whole area. There are small and medium -sized companies in the industry. As the transport costs are high in this case, a centralized system must also be created, as transporting a scrap for more than 100 kilometers is not a profitable activity. I think it is good that this directive does not have to touch museum cars, and I think we need to add it to the directive. So, in the case of museum cars, I have to make an exception. It is also good that we are clearly in charge of the manufacturer. It is the basic principle, and we have to stick to it. The manufacturer is responsible for the design. Thus, the manufacturer can do a lot in the design of the environment. We also need to hold on to the fact that the manufacturer is responsible for the costs in whole or for a significant part, as mentioned in a common position. I think it is a balanced wording that does not exclude certain other things. I think we have to hold on to it. Therefore, our group holds as tightly as possible from the common position and does not change the essential points of the common position. Of course, we all know that it was very difficult for the Council to make a common position and that it was very difficult to balance the common position.	fi
Regarding China, we should not give up approaching the question simply because discussions in the matter could be blocked.However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts in Chur, and threats of commercial sanctions should strengthen our resolution instead of weakening it.However, if we want to give full expression to the decisions that may be taken in Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must receive the necessary resources.The United Nations financial resources are distributed chichement and, because of this, many essential programs depend on voluntary contributions in order to survive.Resources are also necessary to promote practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, definition of priorities and the strengthening of communications between the Donor Community and the United Nations Member States.To this end, the high commissioner recently launched an annual call of US $ 53 million to allow her office to carry out these tasks.The European Union and its Member States should take the initiative and contribute to a large extent to the granting of these funds.By doing this, not only would we embarrass the United States, which should assume their responsibilities in relation to the financing of the United Nations, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to the defense of human rights is more than simply rhetorical.Mr. President, in this debate there is mainly question of the preparation of the United Nations Annual Assembly devoted to human rights which must be held soon and the efforts of the Commission and the Council on this occasion.I must first say that I am very happy with the contribution made until now by Mr. Patten and by Mr. Minister, and I also find good that China and Cuba are also the object of the debate.Cuba remains the last dictatorship in South America and we should not forget it, despite all the sympathy that some here and there can experience for Cuba.It is a dictatorship and therefore not a democracy.During the two minutes attributed to me, I ask for your attention in order to look into two countries to which I feel particularly linked.The first is Indonesia.We are obviously very happy that Indonesia now has a new government and that Mr. Wahid and Mrs Soukarnopoutri occupy the presidency and the vice-president respectively.We also welcome what the situation in Timor evolves slowly in the right direction.However, I point out to you that in the Moluccas, an archipelago located just north of Timor, violence has not yet been mastered.Thousands of deaths have been counted in the past two years.Tens of thousands of people have fled.The situation is not well in hand.I know that, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, a whole program will be devoted to Dutch television there and that we beg there that observers are sent to the region so that they can realize what is exactly there, so that the facts are in any case registered, for after in particular, when human rights commissions will be able to go there.My pressing request is this, and it is also a point which has been mentioned several times in resolutions: Can not consider sending observers to Moluccas?	fr
"Approved today the addition of 5% of other vegetable fats except cocoa butter, the European Parliament may open the way to many other scams. Because e.g. Don't call olive oil tomorrow the oil to which we have added palm oil? Secondly, if the text of the common position does not change, consumers will need a magnifying glass to find the composition of chocolate products. For this reason, I really please my colleagues to vote for amendments that will allow consumers to first glance distinguish the real chocolate from chocolate containing other vegetable fats other than cocoa butter. Finally, with a position of ours, the producers' countries, which we already know today that the price of cocoa is at its lowest levels, there is a risk of the price of that product to collapse tomorrow. In order to avoid chaos in producers in producers, the European Parliament must impose an impact evaluation study of export impacts. That is why I invite you to support all the amendments submitted by members of the Committee on Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy. Mr President, Mrs. Commissioner, as chocolate lovers know, a good chocolate is made from cocoa butter. Any addition of other fats alters its taste. After all, the 1973 directive banned the use of other vegetable fats other than the cocoa butter in order to protect this quality. With the integration of new countries into the European Union, derogations from this strict ban began to apply. In the name of free movement of goods it needed harmonization. The Commission could therefore choose to harmonize the European standard and extend the ban on all Member States. But under the pressure of multinational companies, who wanted to reduce their production costs, the Commission proposed in April 1996 a directive that allows the addition of small amounts of vegetable fats. During his first reading, parliament was entangled in dangerous gears, essentially accepting the directive under certain conditions. The Council took advantage of the previous one and approved its common position, which recognizes the name ""chocolate"" even with the addition of other vegetable fats. He once again defeated the profit of some against quality for everyone. The European Parliament, however, can do the second reading in this directive, the application of which can have a serious impact. Consumers and craftsmen chocolate may suffer a qualitative blow and leveling. As for Cocoa -producing ACP countries, they may experience a significant reduction in their markets and incomes. These are more than $ 300 million only for the Ctlie Coast. It is not enough to talk about the great concern of these countries here. The vast majority of my team, therefore, interested in the interests of consumers and ACP countries, supports the ban on vegetable fats, defending the authenticity and quality of true chocolate. That is why we suggested that the joint position of the Council be rejected."	el
"That is, you, that is, Parliament, should reduce your requirements, especially your financial requirements. ""But if we do not quickly confirm the Life Regulation in the joint decision procedure, it will be delayed in 2000, and NGOs and actors are waiting for the budget. We will be said to be: ""For a moment, we do not have time to discuss that even though our parliamentary procedure is not particularly in the council. Importance in the context of environmental issues. I would also emphasize the fact that Parliament cannot give up on blackmail, because then Parliament would have to be the only one who would do something about it. So, first of all, in the context of a mediation procedure, our colleagues will support us - the sounds usually approach each other in this respect - and also that the Commission and the Council listen to us and that we each come a little against each other. It is true that we openly disagree with some choices made by the Council and the Commission. I have the opportunity to go back to that later. But here, too, the same fact that this setting is better than the settings for Life I and Life II steps. Firstly, because the basic proposal gave the Life funding device more discipline, openness and rationality. Secondly, the common position combines some essential aspects of the European Parliament in the first process, that is, it defines the promotion of employment as a component of the assessment when choosing the objects to be nominated, as well as the overall impact of the products from their production to their recycling and disposal as one of the Life environmental instrument. Thirdly, we are very positive about the fact that the common position has first taken the use of coastal areas and regional arrangements as one of the factors to be promoted in the LIFE environment. Mr President and Good Members of the Parliament, but despite all these good aspects, a regulation on the Life III funding equipment fails to be the most important of the effectiveness of the financial instrument: in the budget. Once the Commission and the Council have persistently stayed in the reference amount of EUR 613 million proposed by the 2000-2004 season and have rejected the $ 850 million amount proposed by the European Parliament, they are now in the process of making a decision not based on the same reason for rationality and justice. For our part, we want to tell the Commission and the Council that we do not give up our intention to give the Life funding instrument a budget that it deserves and is best guaranteed by environmental results for such an instrument. We justify our choice with four very simple claims. First, Life is the only instrument of direct funding for the European Union for promoting environmental policy. There are no others. Secondly, Life is a good result of the tool, it has made it possible to develop new creative methods and techniques and has an excellent performance. Thirdly, the budget for the LIFE funding equipment has been reduced in real-life and has not remained at the level of enormous dynamism and creativity in demand. Fourth, Parliament has, for its initial appreciation to the Life funding equipment, recorded its annual budget budget, which would therefore mean translating the Council and the Commission's proposal to the reverse of this trend, contrary to our consent. However, we are not concerned about the question of the budget alone."	fi
"Linking both goals is not easy.It does not arise by itself. There may be certain contradictions between the two goals, and nothing indicates that the Commission has named these opposites and showed opportunities for its overcoming.As for the other side of the agenda, Mr Commission President, namely the cohesion and regional development, we must certainly show significant achievements here.However, there are also regions that remained, especially island regions, which should be given more attention.In terms of fishing, there is nothing in her program that the devastating overfishing, which led to the disappearance of whole species, would have drawn any lessons for the future.In these things, it may be necessary to vigilance and more Esprit de Finesse.Ms. President, First of all, I would like to repeat the reminders expressed by many of my colleagues with regard to this five -year program.Despite ambitious long -term goals, we must not lose sight of the present.The chairman of my parliamentary group, Mr. Poettering, referred to this in his opening contribution with great emphasis.The Union must not take on a whole series of new tasks without having a successful European economy as a basic requirement.This requirement clearly forms the internal market.And what about the current level of development of the internal market?I would like to remind Mr. Prodi and his colleagues who are still present, the results of the investigation of 3,000 European companies carried out by the Commission itself.Almost 40 % of them state that measures to comply with national requirements for their products and services cause additional costs.So the commission itself in its investigation.These are the classic symptoms for continued disability by national governments - bureaucracy that prevents market entry.In terms of completion of the internal market, the commission's program has a disturbing complacency.We stubbornly work on dismantling other obstacles in all areas, strengthen the pressure on the Member States, which fail to carry out the corresponding measures to complete the internal market, and take decisive new areas such as financial services.We can only successfully expand the Union with an internal market as a sustainable basis.An extended Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.The expansion of the internal market to an extended Union should be an enforcement of enormous level.Finally, in the name of all my conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this parliament - assure that we will support the Commission and Mr. Prodi in the implementation of this historical task.Ms. President, Mr Commission President, Ms. Commissioner, the Men Commissioners, Estimated Colleagues!I can start with a quote: ""The commission will continue the preparatory work on a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and submit proposals for the implementation of an ambitious program. In particular, the Commission will propose that a real European asylum and immigration policy will be designed, and it speaks out for the fact that legal assistance and justitial cooperation is being strengthened and an effective approach to combat every form of crime is developed.is the entire program for the next five years on the subject of internal security, freedom, rights of citizens and cooperation between the judiciary."	de
and in writing. Our main attitude towards the EU is positive. As Swedish liberals, we perceive European integration as a possibility of resolving supranational problems such as the environment, trade, free cross -border circulation, human rights and the handling of crisis. Here, the Republic of Europe is given an opportunity to show the rest of the world that cooperation leads to peace and growth of prosperity. We also believe in the principle of auxiliaryism, that is, to make decisions as close as possible to those concerned. That is why we are actively promoting the issue of the Community Constitution, where the division of responsibilities is clear to everyone. It must be quite clear to all citizens that the EU will only deal with those issues for which they are the most responsible, that is, supranational. All other issues should be addressed at local, regional or national level. Social policy is an example of an area where the EU must only have limited responsibilities, except in cases of free movement of people within the Union borders. Each Member State must have the absolute responsibility and the right to decide itself for its own social protection system. The care, childcare and elderly care are clear examples of sectors that are not directly supranational. The same is true of labor market policy. We do not believe that single European legislation in these areas is the solution to the problem of social protection systems. On the contrary, it is important for us to focus the EU on a small number of sectors, where it can really be useful. This, however, does not prevent Member States from cooperating and exchanging ideas in the social sector. The issues of social protection and equality are traditionally located high on the agenda of the liberal program. We support all of the ideas presented at the Andersson exhibition at the national level..(It) We are expecting with interest and hope a coordinated strategy of modernizing social protection systems in Europe, which will not, however, be cut off from a similar cohesion process: a modernization, but also a cohesion, as emphasized in the report by the rapporteur, with whom we agree. Many policies have already followed, though difficult, this last path, but there are still many that will have to follow him before Europe is made, even in the context of the auxiliary, the tangible representative of a common family, not only for the citizens of the Member States but also for those of the candidates. European social protection systems have always played a positive role in the processes of political and democratic development of every people; and if today, in the face of developments in economy, labor, demands of society, these systems must continue to play a role in supporting growth, there is no doubt that they need an action. The aspects we want to emphasize, however, are mainly three: the first concerns the close interdependence that must exist between economic policies, employment policies and social security policies at a direct proportional level.	el
While we are sitting here, hundreds of thousands of people run a huge danger due to the floods in Mozambique.It doesn't just happen.Floods have been extended for weeks, and yet it is only now that we seem to assess the needs.The level of practical assistance of the community and the Member States was pathetic.For a long time, many of us launched a warning saying that the European Union spent too much time on its project, potentially prejudicial and essentially political, to establish military decision -making structures.On the contrary, she should have concentrated her efforts on improving her civilian instruments, in particular those intended for humanitarian interventions.I recognize Mr. Patten's efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States did not spend as much time to define their capacity to provide help in the event of disaster and humanitarian assistance that they devote to the dangerous operation of creating military structures which, in the end, will be double job with those of NATO and the shaking.Of course, there is a link between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.They don't date from yesterday, but NATO is already taking care of it.I have not yet heard any convincing explanation in terms of justifying security policy explaining the reasons why the European Union needs to define autonomous decision -making capacities for the use of the military forces not part of the NATO structures, unless it is to create bodies that will compete with NATO.After all, EU member states are either full -fledged NATO members or they sit at the table of the Euroatlantic partnership council.NATO is largely European.Finally, Mr. Solana, I just would like to ask you what it is for to have, within the Council Secretariat, the political planning and early alert cell as announced, if we are still surprised by another humanitarian disaster.Mr. President, High Representative, the Commissioner, on the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly retained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular.However, what happened, and what is still going on in Chechnya, is akin to a genocide.How else should we qualify the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400,000 inhabitants, the incessant and disproportionate bombing of localities, villages, neighborhoods, where were perhaps mixed with a few Chechen fighters the entire civilian population?How should we qualify the sinister filtration camps, assimilated to concentration camps, in which the population undergoes the worst humiliations and where valid men from 15 to 65 rarely come out alive?How to qualify rapes, looting, voluntary fires, deportations, called cleaning, reminiscent of the worst episodes of the European Middle Ages?And what about the lead screed that falls on Russian and international journalists, and on the banishment of humanitarian organizations as well as any international commission of inquiry into the places of massacres?	fr
"The coordination of social policy and dialogue are good things, but we must avoid putting everyone in the same basket;The plurality of solutions must be maintained.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, compared to the strategy that is exposed here, concerning the modernization of Social Security, I would still like to raise a few points, certain positives and others in the form of a question.I find positive the movement which extends slowly but surely to the file.It seems good to me.It also seems useful to me.I find the main lines of communication just as positive concerning the strategic approach.We also hope that the four objectives mentioned there may be achieved reasonably.We would also like to underline the interest of the way in which this file was discussed, on the one hand by the ""Luxembourg"" process, the guidelines, but we also think that the interest lies in the fact that, as Ms. Van Lancker has already specified, directives are advanced with regard to atypical work, the self -employed without staff, etc.However, we plan two problems for which solutions will have to be found.The first is that it is a question of the decline in social security, where we hope precisely that it is a level convergence.Here I would like to give some examples drawn from the investigation which was recently carried out by the Dutch professional movement on social security reforms within the European Union.It emerges from this study that adaptations take place everywhere, but that many of these adaptations, even the majority, prove to be downward adaptations, the rest constituting improvements.The vast majority of these adaptations are oriented on pensions, there are eleven limitations and two improvements.For unemployment benefits, we note six limitations and five improvements.The reasons for these adaptations are for example the improvement of working conditions, the reduction of social security expenditure, but also competition from policy and UEM criteria.This policy competition is found mainly in the Nordic countries.The greatest stability and even social security improvements are concentrated in the countries of the South.One in the other, we also observe a limited role of the social partners throughout this process.This does not seem very positive and means that the convergence strategy must be oriented on the best approaches.If I can express myself like this, we don't always appreciate cappuccino.Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the commission and the rapporteur in my turn.The Commission because it has taken a new step in the direction of the convergence of Social Security and the rapporteur for the quality of the report he provided.European Union policy includes, in addition to an economic and employment policy, also a social policy.To date, it has however remained limited both in intentions and in means.But under the influence of the free movement of employees, the internal market and the euro, the labor markets are also integrated."	fr
Thanks to the principle of partnership and parity as well as to parliamentary assistance through the joint assembly, it is a world model.It is good that in this jubilee year, which also allows us to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the cooperation initiated by the Lomé Convention, we are about to attend the conclusion of a new partnership agreement which also values ​​the role of the joint assembly transformed into a real parliamentary assembly, both for the EU and for ACP.During this retrospective, I would therefore like to limit myself to the year 1999. Indeed, our colleague Corrie has already alluded to it in an admirable manner.Most of the things that affect us today are the result of fundamental transformations observed since the late 1980s on most of the globe.This transformation process has also led to upheavals in extreme violence in developing countries.These continue to feel the side effects today.ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.From Lomé I to Lomé VI, we have observed obvious advances in the level of the successive content of the agreement.Simultaneously, the number of partner states has increased significantly and is raised today to 71. We will especially note the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa, which has greatly affected all those who took part.It is now Cuba who has just struck the door.If this country is accepted within the ACP-EU community, this will constitute progress rich in consequences which will not be without initiating a process of change in Cuba itself.ACP cooperation is therefore very much interest, not only due to the new accents appearing in the agreement.The fight against poverty and support for sustainable economic, social and cultural development constitute important objectives in order to build in the ACP countries of democratic societies and respectful of human rights.This includes in particular a strengthening of democratic institutions.On this subject, the history of the joint assembly attests impressively a positive development.While people formerly representing ACP countries at the negotiating table were mainly members of the government, civil servants or ambassadors, nearly three -quarters of our interlocutors are now elected members of a parliamentary assembly.If this representation by parliamentarians had to be 100 %soon, as the new agreement wishes, we should celebrate the event.Alas, the ongoing democratization processes go much more unnoticed than the various crises that arise in these countries.He is therefore given much less attention.Cooperation or regional integration is a specialty of ACP multilateral cooperation.One of the wishes taken up in the long list of expectations of the European Parliament will finally be carried out.Soon, the joint assembly will also be able to hold regional meetings.We have already heard of it.Strengthened regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts of an ethnic, economic, social or religious nature and therefore have a preventive effect.It is for the same reason that the European Parliament has always been expressed in favor of a participation of civil society in the decision -making process and in the management of cooperation and it has always stressed the importance of decentralized cooperation.The strengthening of contacts between the joint meeting and the social partners, as provided for in the new agreement, again constitutes a step in the right direction.However, there is a small inconvenience, namely that the European Development Fund is still not integrated into the European budget.	fr
"Madam MP, I recognize that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this area are insufficient.It does not make any doubts for anyone, I think.I do not want to connect this question to the comments I made on the period ""before"" and ""after"" NATO intervention, we will probably come back to this point at another time of this time.However, I would like to tell you that the European Union is aware that the financial resources transported to Kosovo correspond to what it was possible to do, to the extent of the possibilities.It must be understood that our responsibility in this region is a responsibility shared with the international community.It is a responsibility in the face of which the European Union has a determined role, but we cannot pretend to quickly rebuild the structures which were not already of the best before military action in Kosovo, as you rightly recalled.Moreover, it does not seem to me, Madam, that military actions in Kosovo have contributed to such an important destruction of health structures, which have a direct effect on the current situation.The current situation is essentially linked to the dramatic situation in terms of displaced populations, it is linked to a set of elements of an economic nature and to the level of satisfaction of essential health needs arising from the general decay of the organizational structure of the Kosovo administration.This is the basic question underlying the whole current situation.There will be no solution to the problem of children's health, nor to other development problems in the region, as long as we have not solved the problem of political nature, which must be done within the framework of a resolution of the United Nations.I want to broaden the debate a little by evoking the situation in Mitrovica.The international community has reconstructed the hospital there with the aid of Europe, but the building is located in the northern district of the city, which makes it problematic for the Albanian Kosovars.This means that Albanian Kosovars remain deprived of medical care.This situation is repeated in other places in the country, provoking tensions between the Albanian Kosovars and the Serbs, the distrust between the populations being general, some not wanting to be treated by others and vice versa.I understand that you are saying, and you are right to say, that the European Union must work within the framework of a larger international cooperation association.But on which lever are you going to weigh to change the situation?What are you going to do so that the Albanian Kosovars can also be treated in a hospital, especially in that of Mitrovica?Mr. MP, Mitrovica's question is known.This is a very particular situation, where interethnic tension reaches a degree of severity fortunately absent in other areas of the Kosovo territory.I fully understand your concern.I would like to tell you, however, that Mr. Bernard Kouchner acted following a line which aims to preserve what underlies the United Nations resolution in the matter, in an attempt to create the conditions of multi -thnic structures that can serve the different communities, including at the level of the different dimensions of the administration."	fr
President, Mr. Council President, Commissioner Patten!I would like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share.That's why I will not repeat anything of what he said.I just want to make three comments that may be seen similarly by Commissioner Patten, but for various reasons I cannot be formulated as openly as by a MP.First of all, I believe that we can look forward to the agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.But we now have enough agreement: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm-El-Heik.This is sufficient for agreements, they just have to be fulfilled.Here, however, I share my colleague Salafranca's skepticism when he says that there was bad news from Israel this week, namely that this last agreement cannot be met on time.The second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.I think this is a very encouraging message.But we also learned this week that Mr. Barak does not go to Washington and the negotiations cannot be continued.I would like to find out very clearly: If the Golan heights are returned to Syria, the problem is solved in this region.On the question of the referendum that different colleagues have addressed: We have to consider whether you always have to carry out a referendum to fulfill obligations from international law and from international law!In Germany, one would probably be very happy if we would say that we are carrying out a referendum for the payments to the European Union, and we make it dependent on whether the German people are also willing to pay.That would be a similar situation.Third and last point: the role of the European Union.I really want to pretend what the excellent role of the special ambassadors Moratinos played in the region, and also what we have done in financing there, Mr. Commissioner Patten.You know that you will always find support in this parliament, also for your suggestion.We will be there if it is to be financed.But we also have to play a political role, and Mr. Moratinos cannot play that in this region alone.The Presidency of Council has to work, the Mister GASP has to go to the region, and, as the Russians did, we have to invite the protagonists of the peace process themselves.Then we played the role that corresponds to our participation and our contribution.President, Commissioner Patten, revered colleagues, the peace talks, who recently started in the United States between Israel and Syria, are a turning point in the history of the Middle East, which we have been waiting for for 50 years now and which will certainly be difficult to master.No meetings will take place in Shepherdstown today, but we can hope, as Commissioner Patten said earlier that this postponement of negotiations due to the latest Syrian demands is only a smaller incident on the way to a peace agreement that will change the entire Middle East.This is exactly the content of our resolution: the hope of a fair and balanced agreement, founded on the preservation of sovereignty and right to a life in safety within safe and recognized limits.	de
I am focusing that this will continue to be quite important for our future and for the European economy, and especially to ensure our wealth and the general technical development of Europe. Mr President, British Conservatives, believe that the Union's competition policy must be applied effectively and in a uniform manner in order to implement a effective uniform market throughout the European Union. As a result, all proposals that propose significant reforms to the Competition Policy Implementing System must be examined carefully and carefully. The truth is that the uniform market is not yet perfect. I have been a member of the Parliament for half a year and during this time I have clearly found out how decisively many members are moving the so-called Europe project. We hear daily that we need to promote a wider and deeper Europe. However, all of these are actually just jewelery, as national, regional and local barriers continue to complicate the actual European cohesive market. I want to look at the Commission's proposals in this context. I would like to make it clear that we have a lot to trust and respect him to the Commission member Mont. We look forward to being able to eradicate the cartels. However, he should understand that, as for anyone, we must consider his suggestions and look at them carefully. Indeed, von Wogau, a rapporteur of the Economic and Financial Committee, has done so. Unfortunately, even though he is not there, I want to congratulate him on how thoroughly and carefully he has prepared his report - and also that he lasted, even though I was a spike in his flesh! He previously mentioned that the report received a significant majority behind, but not my support. So, even though I do not agree with his conclusions, I think he has raised many of the issues that the Commission must consider in his report. The first question is the possibility of re -nationalization of competition policy. I know the Commission is opposed to it, but there is such an opportunity. I am still concerned about the performance of national courts and national competition authorities. I am still worried about the activities of the entire legal process. Recently, I asked the Commission member Monti what happens if he happens to be wrong and the competition policy is really nationalized. Member of the Parliament von Wogau said we could turn to the court of the European Communities. Well, in the UK, we are now waiting for a reaction to the Court of Justice. We consider that the Court of Communities is unable to grant us temporary measures in a certain dispute that we are currently undergoing France and where we have a commission support. That someone does not consider this to be just a nationalist comment, in the Factortaman story, where the Great British government was a defendant, it took 10 years before the judgment of the Communities was sentenced. So something must be done for the legal process. I ask the Commission how to speed up enforcement in this area. With regard to legal certainty, I support the idea presented by Parliament Thyssen. It is important that companies have legal certainty. I mentioned this recently to the Commission member Mont. He said we should not always let the lawyers lead ourselves. The matter concerns me because I am, not only a lawyer, but also formerly the United Kingdom Minister of Competition. After all, we all have to live with our past, but it is important that companies have legal certainty. I would also ask the Commission whether this change has been analyzed in any way: whether there is a cost-benefit analysis that is now clearly becoming more common in European policies. I know that the consequences for the Commission have been analyzed. We have heard how much people's time is wasted nowadays and that changes would therefore be useful. However, I really think that in this situation we want to know what consequences of the change would have for companies. Finally, we British Conservatives hope to change the direction of the direction of the independent competition authority. I would like to hear what to say about the Commission member Montti has this.	fi
We always come back to the same fundamental problem of Europe: our economic life is not dynamic enough and it does not sufficiently encourage the individual initiative.The economy must be strong, so that we can take care of our loved ones and the environment.It is not politics, but the simple logic of life.Regarding the use of credits now, it is positive that they are centralized because the sprinkling will end up volatilizing them.Now we have to concentrate our efforts to solve the problems of large and medium-sized cities since they do not have enough critical masses.We will also be able to give additional momentum to the surrounding rural areas.We often forget that the problems of the cities and those of the countryside will actually go hand in hand.Everything is based on the encouragement of individual innovation and business spirit because the mobilization of masses, which begins among individuals, leads to an internal renewal of the area.Giving credits without a healthy and independent economy would be like pouring water into a well: there will be drinking for a while but the next day the well will be empty again.Mr. President, with the implementation of Interreg III, the European cooperation policy enters a new phase.Internal borders are no longer alone at the center of our concerns, those external are there too.In the context of the globalization and cultural openness that characterizes the current situation, the European Union needs instruments which allow it to strengthen its links and its communication channels with the neighboring regions, in particular the east and the south of Europe.The boundaries of the Union will no longer have an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to make cooperation more fruitful.Thanks to the amendments approved in committee, the Parliament tried to complete the work of the Commission, by introducing new elements into the list of areas recipient of aid, in particular in favor of the external and maritime borders of the south of Europe.In its orientation project, the Commission recognizes that these borders require more attention than in the past.And this because of the process of widening to the east and the process of integration reinforced with the countries of the Mediterranean basin.As President Prodi recalled when he explained the 2000-2005 strategic objectives, the revival of the Barcelona process represents a priority for the Union, and the Interreg III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.While congratulating us with the very good work accomplished by the rapporteur, we only hope that the Commission will take into account proposals put forward by the Parliament, thus respecting the commitments made within the framework of the code of conduct for the implementation of structural policies, and that it confirms through changes which are imposed on the conversion of this community initiative so that the latter is no longer a simple internal instrument butRelaxation and valuation of relations with neighboring countries.Mr. President, since this year, the structural funds have benefited from an amount of around 200 billion euros until 2006. Only 5.75 % of this sum are reserved for Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, Urban and Equal.	fr
