It is therefore essential that this assembly establishes with as much force as possible the principle of the application of the Equal program to all refugees.To conclude, I would like to say that I felt some scruples last week, when we discussed the constitution of the Austrian government.But when it comes to Austrian policy towards refugees, and we have to criticize it, I no longer have any qualms.I hope that Parliament will be able to engage just as much, this time.Mr. President, in the context of the 1994-1999 financial prospects, when 13 different initiatives were carried out, the Interreg II tranfronier program was an important initiative.The fact that the next cycle of structural funds 2000-2006 understands the Interreg initiative proves, I think, very clearly the importance that the national member states of the EU attach to it.The Interreg program for the period 1989-1993 and the Interreg II program for the period 1994-1999 proved to be real success because they brought the economic and social development of border member states.I come from border counties in north-west Ireland, I have therefore seen, over the years, the important role that Interreg I and Interreg II have played, and I congratulate myself on Interreg III.The Commission grants an envelope of 67 million pounds via the Interreg III program, which will be spent to continue the development of cross -border economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.The European Union has played a key role in the development of the Irish border counties region over the years.The European Union is the major contributor, with 80 million pounds allocated to the International Fund for Ireland.The European Union contributes 75 % to the Peace and Reconciliation program up to 75 %.Overall, Interreg, the International Fund for Ireland and the Peace and Reconciliation Program have all played an important role in the developing peace process.Mr. President, I will intervene on Interreg by limiting myself to a few critical points, also to respect of course the time imparted to me.We all expressed ourselves positively on the confirmation of this program and on the extension of the intervention sectors, in addition to cross -border cooperation, in terms of transnational and transregional cooperation.This does not prevent us from being aware of the fact that most of the resources - from 50 to 80 percent - will be reserved for cross -border cooperation, with a component A of the Interreg III program;In addition, we continue to think that the choice which was made to consolidate the current sectors of cooperation, with regard to the choice of eligible regions, is wrong and contradictory.We hope and we hope that, on this point, the Commission recognizes in substance, and not by a formal tribute, the position of the Parliament.Cross -border cooperation continues to consider almost exclusively that land borders and, where there have been exceptions in reference to maritime borders, these exceptions are not transparent in their choice and often benefit from compensations through other community policies.Discrimination is really much more serious for the islands whose regional condition can only be linked to borders exclusively of a maritime nature.	fr
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has already made progress compared to its guidelines and very little affects the position of the European Parliament on the programs of the period 2000-2006.In the meantime, it is necessary to insist on the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with greater difficulties and the ultra -aperitical regions, of which we have an example in Portugal with the Azores and Madera, in order to achieve economic and social cohesion.In reality, however, the guidelines of the Commission do not fully fulfill these objectives.On the other hand, it is important that there are precise indications and sufficient funds for the creators of quality employment and with the recognition of rights as well as for those in which the equality of rights and opportunities actually promotes, for support for social and solidarity economy, for rural development, for small and medium -sized entrepreneurs, for the improvement of the quality of life of the urban populations of lacking areas, in particular as regards the accommodation.social, for the purposes of sustainable urban development..If the contents of Article 158 of the EC Treaty are aimed at promoting the harmonious development of the set of communities, we must say that the achievement of the suppression of disparities is still far away, indeed, in some cases, as for the areas of Italy falling within the goal 1, paradoxically the disparities increase, above all due to the anchor of poor approach to community procedures by the structural systemcumbersomeness of the procedures;Despite the regulatory interventions, in fact, the streamlining of the community structures has yet to be carried out.If there are no administrative simplification, first of all, community objectives of reforms based on efficiency and concentration can hardly be achieved.In this sense, the document of the Commission is lacking, without any recommendation for Member States intended to simplify the national procedures and regulations regarding the presentation and education of projects by national authorities, as well as in the field of financing, implementation and control.SMEs, micro -enterprises and craftsmen in particular are still ""weak subjects"", given that precisely for them the regulatory and administrative constraints imposed by some Member States, including Italy, represent great obstacles for access to structural funds.A remarkable handicap is the inability and impossibility of the regions and other subjects to plan in time, for which the Commission, which according to the decision on the directors 97/99 (Howitts report) should have consulted in time the parliament, in fact found a sort of comfortable alibi in the establishment of the reduced programming phase in the Member States and published the directors already in July 1999, even before theNeoeletto Parliament started his legislative activities, thus preventing the parliament itself from affecting the current structure of the directors.For this reason, the intermediate assessment of article 42 of Regulation 1260/99 will not assume little importance.The current guidelines do not generally have the value of clarity and transparency.They only touch the theme, although important, of the possibility of measuring the progress carried out in function of verifiable objectives and in total harmony with the strategies of community policies and do not properly focus on the implications of the expansion, so much so that they do not contain specific provisions or clarifications on the matter or for the regional and national authorities or for candidate countries."	it
All the commissioners have committed themselves, provided that they must move to a country and not only to their countries of origin, to a region -I do it three or four times a month -to dedicate a moment of their use of time to a direct dialogue with citizens and not only with personalities or institutional representatives with which we regularly meet, to also establish direct contact, in a universityPeople, answer questions and listen.That will be, therefore, our participation, as their lordships will also participate in that necessary effort, in that burning obligation, which consists in reducing the democratic deficit, that is, the departure of the citizens of what we do.We want to carry it out in cooperation with the Member States, in contact with the European Parliament.We will make a periodic synthesis in order to calibrate the state of opinion well and can adjust or reorient.We also want to carry it out in consultation with the deputies to national parliaments, local representatives, non -governmental organizations, socioprofessional media and the media: the transmitters of opinion, groups and political parties, European, national, representatives, representatives - some of saying it - of the local collectivities or of the national parliaments, the committee of the regions, the social committee, the social committee, the social committee.of civil society and university media.For the rest, I have to remember - and I need to do it - that the European Parliament itself already adopted, on February 1, the initiative - and I want to thank Mr. Napolitano again - to organize a first working meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments, that is, the representatives of the citizens in each of the states.The Commission will propose to the Member States to participate in that operation, either within the framework of concrete cooperation or in that of a more structured association.We are preparing a plan for the media, close contacts with the presidency of the European Union and Parliament.I have already said in what conditions the commissioners themselves will participate during the meetings and visits in the field.What we want is to celebrate citizen debates.Allow me - without pretending to give lessons, that of course, neither advice - remember that, when I had the honor of being a minister of European Affairs of my country, I felt that need to go directly with the citizens and that, by celebrating every week that dialogue in each of the regions, directly, I realized that there was the urgent need for the European Union to have a face, so that it was every week, so that the European union wasA European commissioner, not only the French commissioners, for the rest, accredited ambassadors in Paris, European deputies, to dialogue and realized that the questions were innumerable, intelligent, that people needed to be respected, to be heard and give it explanations.That is what we are going to support ourselves in a budgetary endowment of about four million euros, if your lordships are well to make them available to us.	es
We understand your concern and we will not fail to take it into account, in particular in the context of the future contacts that we will have with Turkey when defining the agenda of the membership strategy planned for Turkey.This question will of course be at the center of our concerns and the European Commission will certainly not fail to take it into consideration.Mr. President, let me thank the president in office of the Council.I am sure that the President in office is a very good man and that he is very kind to his wife, children and dog.That said, you will forgive me if the answer you have just given me leaves me a little skeptical.I do not believe that the public immediately had access to declarations and votes within the council.Could you therefore promise me to write to me, before the next plenary in February, where I can, as a simple citizen, find this information immediately after the adoption of a legislative act by the Council, instead of waiting for it to appear in the press of weeks later?Will you write to me before the next plenary to give me this information?Mr. MP, above all, I would like to say that I dispense with making personal comments like the one by which you started your second question and I will be kind enough to abstain in the future.Regarding the substance of your question, we withdraw the impression that the criticism made to the council, in addition to its specific form which we also take note, does not relate to opacity, let's say, of the legislative process, but almost to excess transparency.I would like to tell you, the deputy, that the results of this type of transparency process are clear to us and undoubtedly.We will not hesitate to repeat this information to you, the deputy, but we cannot go beyond what we have said because it corresponds exactly to what the treaty requires.We therefore believe that all the elements that the General Secretariat of the Council currently makes available to the public are essential elements with regard to the mode of operation of the Council as a legislative authority.It seems to me that the council has not tried to answer my question.I did not ask what his opinion was on the proposal that the commission has not yet presented.My question focused on the interpretation of principle of article 255 of the Amsterdam Treaty.Does it mean that we must also legislate on transparency on the national scale, and not only within the three European institutions which are cited in the article?I would like to get an answer to this question.Does the Council consider that one can, on the basis of article 255 of the treaty, settle national laws in matters of transparency, apart from that which must govern European institutions?	fr
Next week I will go to the Bundestag in Berlin.I've already been to the French Senate.Throughout this debate, I will also go to the national parliaments directly, if possible.As part of the dialogue with the citizens, it is not about operating propaganda or marketing and also no public relations work.I strive for a real dialogue, and after a short film in which it is factually explained what the institutional reform is all about, those who are on the podium can take the floor with open microphone.We will carry out this initiative, as I would like to repeat, in a punctual or constant cooperation with the Member States, and I have the great wish that the governments of the fifteen with their support under the conditions that they consider to be the most appropriate and reasonable.Mr President, I would like to join Mr. Barnier's study group of 700 interns so that there is also a discussion.It is not so interesting to debate the government conference and openness.In connection with the government conference, Mr. Barnier said in parliament that social policy would not be the subject of majority decisions.On page 63, however, it says that the fight against unequal treatment, the right to freedom of movement and stay - i.e. the residence guidelines - should be decided the entire social security system, the renewal of regulation No. 1408 and the measures in the social policy area with individual exceptions by qualified majority resolutions.Does Mr. Barnier have no concerns that he intervenes in the election process of the Member States?Citizens go to choose from such topics and thereby create new majority in Danish folketing and other parliaments.Can this be steered from Brussels?Is that part of the radical decentralization that Mr. Prodi spoke of this morning?I was very happy when I heard last week that the Commission wanted to pay more attention not only between the Union and the Member States, but between the Union, the member states, regions and cities in the coming years.I hope that Commission Member Barnier will explain this idea in more detail on his dialogue trip through the European regions and to listen and pull closely.Mr. Commissioner, I refer to your answer to a previous question in which you dealt with the possibilities of making the contract - as I want to call it - waterproof in view of the dangers of undesirable developments, and in particular the diversification of sanctions that can be imposed against a member state in application of Article 7 for violating basic freedoms.Do you think that these proposals or suggestions of this kind belong to the mandate of the government conference specified in Helsinki?I don't have this impression on my part.Do you not fear that such sanctions could not only be misused not only against human rights violations, but also against mere disagreements, against opinion offenses or deviations from the prevailing European unit thinking?Yes, Mr. Bonde, we will start this dialogue with 700 young people in Brussels who will work in the institutions and the Commission, and I believe that this start is a good start for this dialogue with motivated young people.	de
The competition between the regions will certainly strengthen the European Union and not weaken.Here I call the topic of GA funding, the example of Sparkassen and Landesbanken, the example of the seal of approval.Here a region has created something on its own to market its own products.This initiative must not be destroyed from a European level.I think that an increase in the Dinimis control is also necessary.We should do everything we can to promote the competition between the regions.The second is a discussion about competition and social market economy, although I am now not talking about market failure.I have already indicated the area of ​​state banks and savings banks, but now I take to the extreme what you hear on one side or the other.A resident of an old people's home is now housed in the social area.But I can also consider him a customer, and I think we should discuss quite clearly and in time about where the social field, where grown structures mean a stop for the competition.Otherwise, I can name any customer, all areas as customers and thereby destroy very social areas.Finally, I would like to say about the principle of subsidiarity: I think it is urgently needed that where Member States enable the regions and the municipalities to charge taxes, this is preserved and is not regulated uniformly by Europe.Thank you, Mr. colleague.I congratulate you on what is inadmissible in German parliamentarianism in German parliamentarianism.President, Mr. Commissioner, values, colleagues!I take the word in the name of my colleague Robert Goebbel, who unfortunately cannot be present because of a political obligation.Within the committee for economy and currency, the Jonckheer report triggered sharp controversy on the question of how the market works.A narrow right majority has succeeded from the report of any reference to the inadequacies of the market.If our parliament mostly follows this ultra -liberal concept of an allegedly perfect market, the world would not change.Economic relationships in the real world make it sufficiently clear that the elimination of any state intervention on the market does not lead to a perfect competition and optimal resource allocation.The market has been the preferred location of the people since ancient times, but never perfect.The market privileges short -term business and quick profits.On the market, the balance of power between supply and demand in general is to the disadvantage of the weakest - the consumer and the employee.The market needs regulation to work.As a counterweight, the necessary and valuable enterprise requires a sense of responsibility towards society.We as European Social Democrats are for a social market economy.The market is not an end in itself, it must serve to improve living conditions.The European Union, the states, must not take the place of economic participants, but the government agencies must determine the rules and goals that enable the economy to develop sustainably.Ultimately, aid can serve to enable restructuring, to offer training courses, to save jobs and thus to save know-how.The main goal of the Union's competition policy cannot be to lower the global subsidy level.	de
I would be delighted, Madame Schroedter, that you can positively consider the inclusion of this amendment proposal, and also in the interest of subsidiarity.Mr. Chairman, the Commissioner, the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has remained unanimous to say that it was strategic and priority to support the interventions of structural and cohesion funds aimed at offering better employment opportunities to the unemployed and to promote equality between men and women.Unfortunately, Schroedter's excellent report did not take into account this criterion despite the many evidence and we will see it later in the Berend report of what these funds actually help the most behind regions to reduce the gap that separates them from the most developed regions of Europe.They grow, but in terms of GDP.Their competitiveness increases, but the increase in wealth does not benefit everyone because employment does not increase and the difference in employment opportunities persists in certain regions.The Commissioner, read the opinion of the Employment and Social Affairs Committee and give him a priority character, because this is where the main problem of citizens lies.In the revision, in the assignment of reserves, take into account, strategically, the need for jobs because this is, ultimately, what the structural funds and cohesion funds require.Mr. President, it is important that the guidelines make it possible to properly guide and strengthen the effectiveness of the programs of the crucial period of seven years 2002-2006, so that finally realizes sustainable development, employment aid, especially for women and young people, and that the balance between economic, social and environmental policies is ensured.It is particularly necessary to attack acute urban problems, to preserve employment in rural areas and, of course, to offer, as precisely provides for article 158 of the treaty, equal chances of development in the European Union islands, also in the Greek islands which represent half.The Union cohesion policy must still be reinforced, because a Europe whose regions have enormous differences in standard of living cannot be credible or viable.Mr. President, ladies, gentlemen, I would like to tell you the great interest that I took carefully listening to the observations, sometimes the criticisms and suggestions that both of you made in your interventions, from the report of Mrs. Schroedter.Everyone understands, Madam Rapporteur, ladies and gentlemen, the reasons, the deadlines - I will come back in a moment - and whatever these deadlines or these delays, since it is now that we discuss this report, I consider, in the name of the Commission, that it comes at the right time, being the orientations 2000-2006, since it is at the moment that we are starting the new regional programming.Madam Rapporteur, you rightly recalled that it is in fact mainly in the Member States and the regions to define their own development priorities, the co -financing of programs by our European Union demands, justifies that it is also taken into account of community priorities as they are debated and approved here, in order to promote this community dimension of economic and social cohesion.	fr
"It is recognized that there is an incongruous policy.Good purposes are made again and again, but, in fact, nothing happens.Therefore, it is fair that today we show it.I want to put some examples in order to illustrate these contradictions.Some developing countries produce sugar cane for sugar production.In the union, sugar is also produced by sugar beets.In order to prevent this cheap sugar from developing countries competing with the most expensive sugar in the EU, a severe regulatory exaction is imposed.The result is a serious limitation of sugarcane imports from those countries.At the same time, we allocate a very important development aid to those countries.A minister of one of the Caribbean islands that produce this sugarcane once told me: ""If you allow the normal entry of our sugar into the European Union, we would not need your development aid at all.""Another example: cocoa.The European Union wants to allow the use of 5% alternative fat in chocolate to harmonize the internal market.A zero percent could also be agreed and the internal market would be harmonized equally.If 5%is established, something that for now seems to happen, it is known that, almost certainly, hundreds of thousands of small cocoa producers from developing countries will be harmed.However, it seems that this is the address followed, what are we doing?It is the typical policy that our citizens say: What does Brussels do?It seems that European companies are more important than our own principles, our own coherence and the interests of developing countries.Likewise, in the field of sanctions and embargoes, there are shocking examples. Why a boycott in terms of oil supply to Haiti and not against Burma, where an elected president has been arrested, Parliament has dissolved and some deputies are in jail or even have been killed?Why not a boycott regarding the supply of oil to Sudan, where armed clashes continue to be produced, in which weapons, attention have been paid with money from the oil companies that work in the territories in which refugees are?Incherence is, obviously, colossal.Mr. Nielson has provided us with a beautiful example of the new Lomé agreement.If the new Lomé agreement is launched without more, without all inconsistencies being solved, a policy with mud feet is built, using a biblical expression.The Council has mentioned again and again where the error lies: in agriculture, trade, conflict prevention, peace operations, fishing, immigration, the environment.Commissioner Nielson, what we expect is a good report on these inconsistencies and some concrete proposals to end them.I repeat, otherwise his beautiful examples, all his wonderful policy - and I also tell the Secretary of State - will be built with mud feet and, rightly, he will not achieve much."	es
It is indicated, in paragraph 11, that symbolic measures can replace the political agreement, the political perspective represented by being a candidate.But it is not only a chief of hypocrisy, it is also an aberration, because, dear colleagues, if the negotiations begin tomorrow, this agreement will be signed in a year and will come into force in three years.And I challenge you to think that, among the countries of the Balkans, within three years, you will not have, on the part of Croatia, Macedonia, Bosnia, requests for membership in good and due form.Mr. Racan announced a few days ago, the form of formal membership of Croatia for the end of the year 2000. I am sure that we will have other membership requests and therefore that this beautiful work, this beautiful intellectual architecture will collapse, because it will be overwhelmed by events, as we have been overwhelmed for twenty years by everything that happened in the former Yugoslavia.This would not be serious if there were not the problems that we know in this region of Europe, if there were not the problems which are faced, but which have not yet been resolved by the new government of Macedonia, the problems of cohabitation between the Macedonian majority and the Albanese minority, with the related problems of Kosovo, if there were not the economic problems that we know,Serbia, if there was not the problem which is a veto that should be denounced for what it is, the veto of Greece which, after almost ten years, continues to prevent this country being called by name, and I hope that the performers did not use the term fyrom when I spoke of Macedonia.This is absolutely absurd.I think it is an offense, first of all, with regard to our Greek colleagues, with regard to Greek citizens.It is urgent that this question is resolved.Finally, I had by a blessed chance a letter addressed by Mr. Georgievski, president of Macedonia, to Mr. Fischler, dated March 8, in which, referring to article O, today article 49 of the treaty, he requests that Macedonia can join the European Union.Why has the council not informed us?Why did the Commission not inform us of this formal request from Macedonia?Mr. President, the Commissioner, the Balkans are not only an obscure, politically speaking abyss.It is enough to see the clearly positive developments in the Republic of Macedonia in recent years, critical years.The abominable ethnic climbing in neighboring Kosovo did not make oil on its territory.Paradoxically, but this is true, the war on the battlefield of Kosovo Polje had exactly the opposite effect: the dangerous gulf of mistrust between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority has been sharply reduced.In the opinion of the first, the last behaved loyal to the common state during the international explosion of conflict in Kosovo.And in the perspective of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state have largely fulfilled their obligations of neighbors towards the Albanian majority of Kosovo so hard.This remarkable result of the conflict in Kosovo can therefore rightly qualify as a second internal political pillar of the Republic of Macedonia.	fr
And all this in accordance with the principles we have always supported.Thank you, Mr Segni, I will gladly do it.In fact, this is absolutely compliant with the position that our Parliament has always supported.Lady president, I would like to draw attention to a case that Parliament has been following for some time, i.e. the case of Alexander Nikitin.We all are pleased that the Court has acquitted it, reiterating that also in Russia access to information on the environment is a right sanctioned by the Constitution.Now, however, it will be put in accusation again because the public prosecutor will appeal.As we know and as we have revealed in countless resolutions - even in the last plenary session of last year - it is not simply a judicial case and it is a serious mistake to accuse Alexander Nikitin of having committed crimes and criminal acts, especially since we, as those interested, have benefited from the results of his research.These results are the basis of the European Barents sea protection programs.I therefore ask you to examine the draft of the letter in which the main facts are indicated and to support the position taken by Parliament with the Russian authorities, in accordance with its resolutions.Yes, Honorable Scroedter, I will gladly examine the facts relating to the question she exposed as soon as I have received her letter.Lady president, allow me to first compliment her for having been faithful to the word date.In fact, the number of television channels available in our offices has increased enormously in this first round of the new year.However, Mrs. President, it has not yet been followed by my request.It is true that now we have two Finnish and one Portuguese channels, but unfortunately the Dutch canal is still missing.And it was precisely what I had asked, given that we Dutch parliamentarians, when we are sent to this monthly exile, would like to be able to see the news in Dutch.I repeat my request once again: make sure that a Dutch channel is also made available.Mr Plooj-Van Gorsel, I can reply that this point appears at the agenda of the meeting of the questions on Wednesday.I hope it will be examined with a positive spirit.Lady president, I would like to know why this parliament does not respect the rules on health and safety that it itself approves.Why wasn't any air quality tests in this building have been conducted since we were elected?Why has the Health and Security Committee no longer gathered since 1998?Why were no evidence of the fire alarm or in the buildings of the Brussels Parliament have been made nor here in Strasbourg?Why are there no instructions to follow in case of fire?Why haven't improved stairs have been made after my accident?Why are not the ban on smoking in the areas reserved precisely to non -smokers?It is absolutely shameful that we do not respect the rules approved by ourselves.Mr Lynne, she is perfectly right and I intend to check if everything she really said has not been done.	it
The question is therefore: what requirements should we possibly ask a monopoly or part of the services that are mastered by a monopoly?On this point, most Member States have always refused to move forward and I am satisfied to be able to note that in my country, the new government is concerned with a subject that should have been treated for a long time and that the Belgian Post and the Belgian government are currently taking the necessary measures in order to ensure that the Post is, for a part, ready to support competition by 2003.That it poses me a lot of problems.I have consulted a series of studies which were commissioned at the time by the European Commission, but at the same time, I find post-Europe documents which claim that these studies are not correct and that the basis on which they were carried out is wrong.I think the commission could at least be a little more active on this point and could have provided us with a little more information.She could also have sent us the studies she had promised us and that we also asked.As far as I know, this has not yet been the case.I therefore ask you, Mr. Commissioner, to help a new member like me in his heavy task.Like Mr. Miller, I would greatly appreciate that in the months or weeks to come, and even if possible in the coming days, you explain to us where the execution of the 1997 directive is. Second point: what is the state of progress of the universal service, how much it costs, how is it organized, how do you plan, what proposals can you formulate?I would like to receive more concrete information on this subject.Apparently, La Poste is a very powerful lobby and rightly so.Hundreds of thousands of people earn their lives in La Poste.In addition, Mr. Miller also pointed out, my country will not be scratched either from the card, despite the density of its population, if the factor does not pass every day.However, we have a large number of people with us, elderly for example, who see only one person on their day and it is the factor.So let's also try to take it into account.La Poste represents much more than the simple transport of packages and letters.For companies too, La Poste is particularly important.It emerges from a study that 90 % of postal traffic is carried out between companies, compared to 10 % between people.What actually do you want to liberalize?I would like to be better informed about this, because the most important question is how you can better serve the customer with the services that exist.There are postal companies that have a monopoly and which still work in a very valid way.	fr
The reports must be submitted to the Parliament Fisheries Commission before decisions are made, otherwise we are only an approval organization.I know that it is hardly the intention of the commission or the commissioner, but we must learn from the errors of the past.Mr. President, we are faced with a proposal aimed at transposing a recommendation from the Cicta into community legislation - which, as has been said, dates from 1998 -, which should be in force since June 1999 and which only reached Parliament at the end of last year.The commission's legislative laziness on certain questions should not surprise us, except because we find ourselves before the recommendation of one of the most important international fishing organizations in the protection of a resource as threatened as tuna.The Mediterranean, and in particular one of its areas, is a very important reproduction area for red tuna, whose commercial value is enormous.This is the reason why the Cicta recommended this closing area in the Adriatic and has strengthened the conditions relating to the capture of zero age tuna.As the rapporteur said, the two measures are completely and largely justified, which is why we can only request their approval.But I also agree with Mr. Gallagher, who expressed his frustration before the slowness of the commission to start the machine and convert recommendations into community regulations.We are still awaiting, for example, the proposal for the ban on the ban on importing the red tuna of Honduras and Belize, a recommendation which dates from 1996. According to my information, it seems that, the CEO of fishing sent a note in the CEO of trade in January and that it has already started preparatory work.But four years to make the ban on imports of known countries effective to promote the pavilions of convenience is an absolutely intolerable period, the Commissioner.We have heard the explanations of the Commission on the long internal process which consists of a transposition, and the image that has remained to us is that of an exasperating bureaucracy.With regard to the only proposal with a view to accelerating what is currently on the table, by which the council and the parliament of the procedure are dismissed, I feed certain doubts.In any case, it is clear that we will have to end up finding a solution to the problem, either within the framework of the Commission report on regional fishing organizations, or, if possible, as quickly as possible.I assume that no one in this assembly is opposed to the principle of the protection of juveniles of marine organizations.Indeed, it is often noted that one of the general objectives of the common fishing policy must be the protection and conservation of living aquatic resources.All this is worthy of praise.Likewise, one cannot doubt the enormous environmental and financial importance of the red tuna.Being myself a confirmed fisherman, I would like the good old days of the 1930s to return when the fishermen of the port of Scarborough, in Yorkshire, grabbed red tuna weighing up to 830 pounds.I do not know the metric equivalent.	fr
Competition, that is to say the war to which large companies are engaged in each other, is constantly reflected in layoffs, by factories, not to mention the immense waste in terms of the use of productive capacities.We still have an example with the job removal plan in Europe from the Trust Abb Alsthom Power.18 million unemployed, 50 million poor in the European Union, yet one of the richest regions in the world: this is the result of this competition that European institutions intend to promote.The desire to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market expressed by the Commission is derisory, because the only law to which competition obeys is the law of the jungle where the most powerful crush or devour the lowest.It is especially revolting on the social level.The European Commission's report crudely shows that the institutions of the Union are only interested in the large capitalist groups which are engaged in this economic war and not at all in the victims it has.Nothing to prevent the extension of unemployment, nothing to protect employees, nothing to prevent large companies from pushing for misery a fraction of the population, simply to enrich their shareholders even more!So, if we recognize this report a merit, it is that of showing that the laborious majority of society has nothing to hope for European institutions to preserve and, even less to improve, its conditions of existence.By voting against this report, we make the spokespersons of all those who have marked their refusal, in Seattle and everywhere in Europe, of a world reduced to a strict market logic.We voted against this report on behalf of the development of public services, and in particular, in memory of the victims of the Paddington Train accident, which were killed not by fatality but by an absurd relentlessness to put competition where it would be necessary.This report is, basically, a primitive text which has no other inspiration than the law of the jungle, because competition cannot solve any of the problems that arise in humanity at this turning point of the century.Whether it is the balance of the biosphere, the promotion of culture or cooperation with the Third World, excessive competition is a factor of regression and insecurity.And the 18 million unemployed in Europe, do you think they are victims of an overly timid application of this competition policy?We are convinced of the contrary, and we also do not think that state aid are by definition too high.Compared to which iron rule, what effectiveness criteria would they be?Finally, after Seattle, do you find it serious to recommend an increased role in the WTO?Only multinational lawyers can show such obstinacy.Jonckheer report (A5-0087/1999) I welcome the quality of the seventh report on state aid in the EU, the now annual nature of its publication and the fact that the General Directorate of Competition diffuses general and specific information on its website.	fr
I think the European Union must do it.I think that the embargo should be raised against Serbia and that, on the other hand, Serbia must free political prisoners.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I fully join the passionate intervention of Mrs. Pack.What he said here is totally successful.In Kosovo there is not a single truth, there are several.I refuse to accept that we can talk about a genocide in reverse, since, in this way, we would miss the truth.I adhere without reservations to the proposal for resolution that we have in front of us.In it we condemn all kinds of violence, of course, but we cannot talk about a genocide in which the papers have been invested.Obviously, the situation in Mitrovica is very dangerous and we all know why that is so.Important economic interests are at stake and we cannot forget the drama of the Trepca mines.We have already referred to the destiny of political prisoners.There is a lot of pain, a lot of suffering in Kosovo.People manifest, people send us messages by email.They ask us where their children are, their sons.We have to offer them a reasonable answer.The case of Brovina Flora is one of the many pending cases.It is positive that we approach it in the resolution proposal, but as Brovina Flora there are hundreds, there are thousands.I pray to the commission and the Council, which is absent, that intervene without more delay in favor of political prisoners.The fact that they are imprisoned in Serbia is one of the factors that are at the origin of the riots and violence in Kosovo.Mr. President, paragraph 10 of the common resolution proposal that we have in front of the Council and the Member States of the European Union to redouble their efforts in order to gather the personnel and financial means necessary to strengthen the United Nations police forces.This request is perfectly agreed with the vision of the high UN representative in Kosovo, Bernard Kouchner.In order to bring its mission of restoring and safeguarding public order in Kosovo, according to its own estimates, at least 6,000 foreign police officers.The UN has promised, on the contrary, the sending of a police force of 4,800 men.However, at the moment Kouchner only has approximately 2,000 police officers.In addition, half of this group comes from the United States and Germany.It is logical that the high UN representative is not happy with this situation, and less given the endemic ethnic violence in the area.Above all, the virulent reproach that Kouchner launched the French government in recent days is disconcerting.Paris abandons his compatriot to his fate in the middle of the crisis zone after sending him a handful of police officers, no more than 37. As is guilty of this little honorable French position, Kouchner points out nothing less than the Minister of Interior Affairs, Chevènement.According to Kouchner, the minister prevents the sending of French police officers to Kosovo for ideological reasons.	es
They therefore concluded that the voting system must take into account the demographic dimension and that the United Kingdom will not give up its right to veto.Is the Council examining the question?Is it willing to maintain the democratic law of veto, based on the actual strength of the population, or is it still oriented towards a simple majority vote by the members of the Council instead of a vote that reflects the European population democratically represented by them?They have representatives of the United Kingdom communicated to the Council their decision and proposal and what consideration did you receive, if you received it?Since the question of the vote is fundamental for the democratic future of the Union, the utmost attention should undoubtedly be paid to it.The way in which the decisions are made is of added importance.Mr President, I thank the Council and the Commission for the declarations made in the morning, but I would like to focus on the consistency of the policies because this is the topic at the agenda.Although it is in agreement on the need to keep a debate on the consistency of the different policies of the union with the development policy, I wonder if this is the most suitable time.However, the Council declaration gave me hopes for the future.It is evident, for me that I specifically deal with development policy, that there are many sectors in which the lack of consistency produces dramatic effects in developing countries.I will shortly provide some examples.However, I remember the assembly that already in June 1997 a resolution of the Council recognized the existence of a serious lack of consistency between some union policies and the policy of development cooperation.In this regard, the Council asked the Commission to present annual reports, the first of which should have been examined in 1998. We are still waiting for the first report, and this is the reason why I believe that the discussion is premature, given that this morning the Commission had very little to say about consistency.The sectors identified by the Council are specific sectors, in which the coherence of policies is of particular importance, such as the construction of peace, the prevention and solution of confetti, the safety of food, fishing and immigration.Some of these issues have been the subject of in -depth analysis.Personally, I believe that issues such as the construction of peace and the prevention and solution of conflicts are the responsibility of the African heads of state, which must be granted the support of the European Union, with the organization of the African unity that acts as a referee.The issues that actually affected the lack of consistency concern sectors such as agriculture, trade, the environment and biodiversity, but here is the real problem: these are highly sensitive sectors in the European Union in general and in this parliament in particular.The MEPs will have different opinions, even within the same political parties, depending on (a) of their country of origin or (b) of the commission of which they are members.There are aspects of the consistency that I would like to examine as a member of the Development Commission that would probably horrify some members of the Commission for Agriculture or the Commission for Fishing.	it
My job as the author of the opinion of the environmental committee is a very simple one.I can agree with the rapporteur and say that the environmental committee has asked the committee for agriculture and rural development and asked to agree to the Commission's proposal.I have gained a lot of time that I sometimes would like for other things and that I will now use a little in anticipation, as Mr. Böge has already done.My report on Tse is not yet available to the house.We were a bit undecided at first, even if we regret it.But I came to the conclusion, it is actually a very clever timing.It is actually quite good that we can already give a few placement of the contracts based on this commission, Mr. Byrne.After we may not have dealt with each other so much with the report from Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf and will certainly not come so close to each other, it may be that it is a little different in this area.Let me say in advance that the part of the complex report that Mr. Böge treated - by the way - a form of good cooperation between two committees, one committee is responsible, the other gives the other an opinion from time to time, which may be an example of the future - is relatively simple.It becomes more difficult if we will see the TSE proposal, Mr. Byrne.If we ask questions directly, the questions that Mr. Böge has already mentioned will come.The question will come -and I will have to put them in the committee -as it will look like with the BSE status of the Member States and other third countries.How will the BSE status actually be defined?Will you also consult a willingness to apply a BSE test for the question of BSE status?And then my constant question to you, Mr. Byrne, whom you already know and which she does not surprise: What about the BSE test?When will you introduce it?Maybe you will even do that before this parliament advises on the TSE report.Not that I want to delay it, but it would be a gesture, so to speak, if you could say: And here the legislative proposal to the BSE tests is available for you!I know that I torture her with it, Mr. Byrne, but sometimes that has to be.I say very emphatically - and afterwards to the report by Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf, who is certainly linked to the overall idea - animal nutrition, animal husbandry, animal production must be in such a way that it is on the one hand, on the one hand, it must be so that it does not harm and endanger people.It cannot be the case that you can exclude cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and other products on the grounds that no damage could arise or that is not dangerous.That is certainly too short, too scarce and too little.With Mr. Böge's report, you are lucky enough to treat it on the side.But you will have the problem with my report that you have to justify yourself a little more and you will get a little more problems with it.	de
Otherwise, I find that we work in terms of symptoms but that we do not fight the causes.The population is very critical, particularly in relation to the use of GMOs.We have to face the growing awareness of the population vis-à-vis GMOs and accordingly regulate their use in animal food.First, if an additive consists of genetically modified organisms where it contains such organizations, it can only be authorized if it presents no risk to human health and for the environment.Second, it is wise to enhance provisions for the additives genetically modified in the food of animals, like the rules of the law on the circulation of seeds, as the rapporteur has also mentioned.Thirdly, finally, to have a transparent consumer policy, we need a labeling for animal feed which is genetically modified.This explicit declaration as to the composition of animal feed therefore allows double freedom of decision, both for animal food users and for subsequent consumers.I find that the decision should be the responsibility of the citizen.We all talk about citizens who are shaken by scandals, who have lost confidence in food security.With coherent regulations on additives in animal feed, we can make an essential contribution to the restoration of confidence.I am therefore also very impatient to hear your answer with regard to our amendments.We will therefore naturally vote so that we can possibly send the proposal to the committee.Mr. President, dear colleagues, this proposal to modify the directive concerning additives in animal feed, which dates back to 1970, is the first of a whole series of proposals on the theme of animal food.In the coming months, we will therefore discuss a few here in Parliament.The major attention that the European public has paid dioxin scandals, antibiotics, purification sludge, etc.proves the crucial importance of this theme.It is therefore an important element in the protection of public health.This is why we are of the opinion that it is necessary to use article 152 as a legal basis, and not of article 37, as proposed by the Commission.The modification that the Commission proposed, namely an equal treatment of the additives which was authorized before and after December 31, 1987, is indisputable and has our full support.The Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development, however, has made some important changes to the commission proposal, unanimously.The regulations proposed by the Commission includes the risk of monopoly when marketing certain additives.The right of request is only granted to those who have received the initial authorization, but companies which later received an authorization are excluded.We should avoid such a monopoly, which could for example lead to an increase in animal feed prices, by granting provisional authorization to all companies that put a determined substance on April 1, 1998. This authorization is then valid until the re -evaluation procedure is concluded.The main change in relation to the commission's proposal concerns the adoption of provisions on genetically modified organizations in the additives directive, recommended by the rapporteur.He took as a starting point the compromise, negotiated between the Parliament and the Commission, on the authorization of the GMOs outside the directive relating to dissemination.This compromise already represents the base for the authorization of GMO.It is therefore logical to also provide provisions on the additives of genetically modified animal food in this case, in accordance with the regulations that we have already adopted in other areas - I will only cite the field of forest reproductive materials.	fr
I would like to notice that considerable progress in this area has been made in Italy;We were probably the first in Europe to prove a regulation to promote the withdrawal of old vehicles, but we also have a fairly outdated vehicle population in our country and are therefore seriously concerned with regard to the market problems that the available guideline could cause.In my opinion, the situation must be carefully analyzed.In Italy, about 80 % of the old vehicles are withdrawn and exploited, but we have a market problem that - since the Italian industry often uses short -time work and layoffs - lead to crisis -bearing phenomena in the employment sector and that workers in various parts of Italy could bring serious difficulties.Therefore, in my opinion you should try to reconcile the two requirements - I sometimes find a somewhat extremist attitude in this parliament.h.Either radically green or diametrically opposite points of view are represented - and to find a synthesis, as in my opinion, all in all the efforts of Mr. Florence and other MPs to somehow in accordance with both points of view.As a result, we now have the interesting amendments;In my opinion, a balanced solution for the problem can be found on the basis of the position that is represented here and the environmental issues can be reconciled with market and employment requirements.Mr. President, this guideline concerns the increasing but comparatively minor problem of scrap cars and the question of more systematic disposal of all vehicles when you have reached the end of your lifespan.For this reason, the guideline may seem desirable, even if it is not urgently required.Now the following key questions arise: Who pays the 262 euros per vehicle for the nine million vehicles that are disposed of every year?Who comes up for the recording, dismantling, disposal, etc.?And should the guideline apply retrospectively to all vehicles that have ever been made?As part of the common point of view, the Council suggests that the costs should be at the expense of the automobile manufacturers.That would be billions of pounds or euros that would come to the large manufacturers in the individual countries of the European Union.The costs would inevitably pass on the prices and thus to the buyers of new cars.Since the European automobile manufacturers have been in business much longer than the Japanese, Korean or other companies, the burden for older European companies would be much greater, which was the same for the competition for a significant competitive advantage.I support Mr. Florence, Mr. Lange and others, who tried to compromise on both sides of the political spectrum based on the cost section.I recommend that I and my colleagues from Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Great Britain agree to agree to the reproach of the proposed measure.REFICIAL LATIONS are poor legal files, they are unfair and frequently impracticable.They are in principle rejected by the majority of democratically chosen parliaments in the free world, unless there is a predominant public interest, which is clearly not the case here.That is why I asked for a name in this matter.	de
This is the area on which the ideological struggle for Europe is concentrated.In my opinion, the debate made it clear.This evening it has become very clear where the political break runs, and it is therefore not surprising that this topic has polarized the debate in a house that is known for its consensus and his policy of compensation.And I am pleased that this difference in opinion comes into play so much, because we are dealing with a radical report.This report is supposed to shake Europe.This report contains radical measures that will ultimately make relief for the labor market.It's that simple. The unemployment rates in Europe are so terrifyingly high because in many cases it is too difficult to hire employees due to bureaucracy, the existing framework and the inflexibility of the labor markets.The only way is now shown.Social justice, and that is what we are all about here, can only be established in Europe if there are prosperity, opportunities and jobs.This report shows very clearly how these goals can be achieved most effectively, because Europe has to wake up.With government spending alone, you cannot create jobs.You cannot create jobs by reducing working hours by law, as if jobs were a cake that can be cut and divided among the citizens.The real world works differently.And if Europe should stay behind if it is supposed to remain in stagnation and unemployment, standing in standstill and the state order, then you will vote against this report tomorrow.But if you want Europe to develop further, so that the citizens of Europe benefit, I call them all to support this report, because it will create the required jobs and opportunities.There is no other option.President, dear colleagues!The great advantage of the original version of the report of Mr. Giorgos Katiforis was that important recommendations for a strategy of the European Union were derived from the concrete statements of the Commission about the EU economy, which could have been the perspective of sustainable development for all countries in our continent in 2000.These recommendations concerned the need for an effective coordination of economic policy at the Union level, i.e.h.The overcoming of the separate management of economic and social policy, which has so far seriously hindered the determination of a coherent strategy to combat unemployment.This vacuum of an administration of the economy at European level is, dear colleague from Wogau, which at least partially causes the weakening of the euro.The recommendations of the report also concerned the creation of a common European research space and the funding - in all Member States of the Union - corresponding measures in the field of research, lifelong learning and employment, whereby every form of unfair tax competence between the states should be overcome.Finally, the proposals of the Weißbuch by President Delor to promote a European project for the creation of a uniform infrastructure and service network were also updated.These recommendations, which largely match the orientations of the program document of the Portuguese Council presidency and are therefore treated at the summit in Lisbon, were rejected or distorted in the committee of the economy and currency of this parliament, namely by a majority that only and solely in the ideological dislocation against a European Union, which on the convergence of the national policy measuresInstead of just being based on one market structure, it was possible to find.	de
Many Member States have not ratified the Convention on the Protection of Financial Interests or made no commitment in this regard and, therefore, it was clear that something more radical had to be undertaken.We must take this responsibility seriously.We must be able to start prosecution against people who commit fraud to the detriment of the European Union.The question is as follows: Who begins the proceedings?This is where things really get bunched.Who is responsible when you have to do with a structure that crosses so many borders?We must also listen to the concerns of the Member States.The proposal to establish a European public prosecutor is very sensitive.We are all aware of the fact that a complete federal approach and a European judicial authority prevailing on national judicial authorities constitute an too premature step for certain people.However, the discussion must be started and we therefore invite the CIG to do so.The way of reacting vis-à-vis the personnel of the institutions of the European Union is of crucial importance for the Parliament, guardian of the budget of the European Union.At a time when we examine the entire reform process, it is essential that we issue the appropriate signal.People committing fraud must understand that they will be continued, which is not currently the case.Ms. Palacio stressed the question of whether we had the legal authority to do so.I would clearly say that my group will offer an amendment to eliminate details concerning how the commission should tackle this problem.We know it is a delicate debate.We know that the Commission may need the possibility of negotiating a situation that would be acceptable to all parties.Let me clearly say that there is no commitment here in favor of a corpus juris, nor in favor of a European prosecutor.However, there is a commitment resolved in favor of a modification of the status quo which is completely unacceptable.Mr. President, I will start by sending my congratulations to Ms. Theato for her report.I think it is an excellent quality report that will obtain the support of my group in its major.I only have the very clear impression that he would have liked to go even before.After hearing the debates of these last five or six months, it seems very possible to me.We all know that in 1995, it was agreed that it would be necessary to ensure better criminal protection of the financial interests of the European Union.Unfortunately, the Member States have not played the game. It is a purely political fact and, at the moment, we cannot do much, it seems to me.However, there remains the possibility that the Commission will take new initiatives on the basis of article 280 of the treaty and I would suggest that the Commission do so as quickly as possible.Unlike the previous speaker who has already left us, my group is very favorable to the institution of a European prosecutor.	fr
Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Solbes Mira.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Excessive deficits annexed to the Treaty establishing the EC The agenda calls for the A50013/2000 report by Mr. Knörr Borràs, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the proposal for the Council Regulation modifying the Regulation (EC) 3605/93 relating to the application of the Protocol on the procedure concerning excessive deficits annexed to the Treaty establishing the European Community (COM (99) 0444 - 0444 - 0444 -C5-0174/99 - 1999/0196 (CNS)) Mr. President, I also have the pleasure of greeting the Spanish Commissioner, M. Solbes, which I have several times congratulated, inside and outside the Parliament, for the excellent work he has done in the Kingdom of Spain in the field of European convergence.The proposal to modify these regulations, relating to the application of the protocol on the procedure concerning excessive deficits annexed to the treaty establishing the European Community, raises a fundamental question concerning adaptation to the European system of dry 95 accounts which, as you know, replaces the previous system of integrated accounts in 79 and above all a question concerning the appearance of new ranges of financial products, consistency in the proportionsGross in light of this European system of 1995 accounts and, finally, concerning taking into account the importance of calculating interest expenditure and their consistency with this new methodology.In my opinion, the proposal for a regulation aims to update the definitions and assessments of certain economic operations involved in the calculation of the deficit within the meaning of the Maastricht Treaty, which sets Maxima percentages for the deficit of public administrations compared to GDP at market prices in different states.Until now, the States have calculated this GDP in accordance with the SEC 79 methodology. The last estimate we have is that which was given in September 1999 and which referred to the 1998 accounting year. Also, if these regulations are approved, the estimate corresponding to March 2000, the first estimate of the 1999 accounting exercise deficit, will already be made in accordance with this new system.We know that the Member States have done - so to speak - their duties, they calculated and developed their national accounts in accordance with the 95 SEC 95, and their corresponding estimates are already published.This supposed, in addition to incorporating the new methodology, the nominal revision of most aggregates and accounting operations due to methodological changes and more refined statistical information incorporated into estimates.Naturally, these changes are likely to modify public deficits in terms of national accounts of the Member States.And very briefly, I will say what are the five areas that may be the subject of the most important changes.First, the adjustments in the delimitation of what we mean by institutional sector public administrations according to the SEC 95. This is important because the public deficit refers to what, in this case, all public administrations.	fr
"Together with him I thank those who collaborated in the project and all the staff who work in the Commission, who participated in the wider debate that has ever been organized within the institution.I would like to emphasize that this method of debate is extraordinarily new and, in my opinion, has forced to make radical transformations also in our way of thinking.The White Paper, which we have in front of them, is also the result of their contribution: they have understood that only a deeply reformed commission can return to being that institution, admired internationally, which was the basis of the history of Europe.With the adoption of the White Paper a chapter of the past is closed - I hope, I hope - definitively.Now we look to the future, to the challenges that await the union and to what we have already indicated in recent weeks, here in front of you, for the 2000-2005 program.The reform finds its profound reason for being political in these objectives of the five -year plan.We need - all the union needs - of a strong commission, a commission that recovering the ability to act as a political subject, recognizable as such in all its actions.For this we are redefining all the priorities on which to concentrate our work.For this - it is another important chapter - we are freeing ourselves of activities whose management is no longer appropriate for it to be up to us, consistent with a principle of decentralization and subsidiarity.For this we reform the administrative machine, so as to create the conditions to effectively carry out our tasks.We will use our resources at best, which are already very scarce now and that we are using up to the last part.If there is a need, however, I do not exclude to return here, in front of you, to ask for additional resources for the new tasks that are there and that they will be entrusted to us.In September we made a reform commitment with the presentation of the White Paper and today we respect the commitment made, in the terms we have made in front of you.The Commission wants to be judged by the facts, only by the facts, based on what we will realize.I remember - it is my last reflection - that the Commission is not the only community institution.Parliament and advice are equally called to fully accept the challenge of these reforms.The Commission has resolutely opened the way: I hope that all the institutions will go through it to the end, at the service of European citizens, for an ever stronger and increasingly transparent Europe.I am pleased to participate in today's debate, together with the president of the Prodi Commission and colleague Commissioner Schreyer, to present the white photographer ""Reform of the Commission"" adopted this morning by the Commission itself.As the honorable deputies can see by reading the document that will be made available to them today, the consultations (which constitute an absolute novelty), carried out with the Commission staff, with this Parliament and with the Council starting from January when the consultation document has been approved, have been very productive and have ended with useful improvements."	it
It is for this reason, estimated commission, an estimated presidency of the Council, that we urge them to take advantage of this political initiative to prevent us from meeting us again in an emergency situation that forces us to restore the payment capacity after one month.On the contrary, we must elaborate a long -term aid strategy for the region.I hope you finally fulfill your political obligations and that the situation we have lived in recent months does not maintain!Mr. President, when the Alliance intervened in Kosovo, did so with the aim of restoring in that province conditions that would allow those who wanted to remain in it or return to it, with its roots and its own culture.The alliance is present today in the field with the same objective.The day before yesterday, I heard with satisfaction an interview granted by the commander of the KFOR, who indicated to what extent they were beginning to improve things in that regard in Kosovo, to what extent they had recovered - in particular, in the sphere of security - an acceptable level the rules on crime.Those who are in the field to represent Europe in the persecution of said objective - and I think in particular in the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General - are on the verge of discouragement, precisely because, as things are improving, there is less talk about Kosovo and the urgency of the aid that should be lending is less evident.We must work so that in that province and throughout the region of the Balkans in general the era of the merchants happens to that of the Lords of the War.It is true that economic aid in that regard is an essential element of the essential possibilities of action that will be provided to those who are present in the field.I collect here the statement that Mrs. Pack has just made and insist that in the European Parliament we must fulfill our responsibilities in that regard, but obviously asking that we are not the only ones.Mr. President, Lord Commissioner, ladies and gentlemen, first of all he would like to thank the speaker, Mr. Brok, for his report.It is true that if the Council had worked with the same speed with which Mr. Brok has worked, we would be more advanced.The delay of the Council in this file really has no forgiveness!The rapporteur and the report are rightly based on the assumption that we must urgently help, although they also rightly point out that it cannot be unlimited or arbitrary help.I would like to refer specifically to amendment 5, which unequivocally stipulates that with the funds of exceptional financial aid, those Kosovar budgetary needs that derive from administrations and public, semi -public, municipal and others that are directly or indirectly controlled by the UNMIK may only be financed.This must be clear, Mr. Commissioner, we support UNMIK, we support the institutions implanted by the United Nations, paying special attention to the IV Pilar, as is natural.Therefore, it is inconceivable that we support the parallel structures that have been created in Kosovo and that continue to work in the same way as before.	es
Therefore, if you have any lesson than to give better than those in this assembly.He knows me sufficiently to know that at all levels at which over five years we have worked together there has not been a single occasion when I have refused to respond completely, formally and in detail of everything I have done.Mr. President, allow me to start paying tribute to Mr. Van Hulten for the suffered work that has meant the elaboration of his report that, in addition, for what I have been able to hear, it has been a good -won suffering.Although relatively new in this assembly, it is also relatively veteran in some aspects, certainly in familiarity with the institutions for its quality of former official - and I believe that the value of this is evident in its ability to deal with this issue that, as several deputies have said, it is so important for all our institutions.I thank you and I wish you a long and distinguished career as a deputy.Mr. President, as you will know, Mr. Van Hulten's report on the second report of the Independent Expert Committee is necessarily long and given that I want to give a complete response, especially issues related to financial management and control, I appeal to your indulgence.Naturally I will not use the assembly time beyond whatever absolutely necessary.When last September this assembly discussed the second report of the expert committee, on behalf of the incoming commission, I promised that the report would be considered as one of the fundamental ingredients of the commission's reform proposals.Our efforts to honor this promise will become evident to this Assembly when the reform package approved by the Commission is discussed today, well within the demanding term we imposed four months ago.I am sure that this will encourage Mr. Pomes Ruiz.The majority of the proposals of the document are very similar to those indicated by Mr. Van Hulten and - I am addressed to him and Mr. Staes - the document includes a very explicit calendar of the actions that have to be taken to undertake the reform.There is, therefore, nothing that has been left open or vague about the report that I have had the honor of compiling.The point of view of this Parliament in the consultation period of the next four or five weeks will be, for obvious reasons, of great importance.I would tell Mr. Elles that we are definitely in the position of listening.But surely you will know how to appreciate - with your usual generosity - that so that we can listen to the answer to what we are proposing, it is necessary that we previously transmit what we are proposing.Therefore, here is the transmission.Although time prevents me in this debate, Mr. President, to comment before the Assembly each of the elements of the resolution, I can immediately ensure that the details will be treated as an important contribution to our reform proposals during this entire consultation period and, certainly, to our work in other relevant areas.	es
On the other hand, the protection of investors can often be better ensured by an actively managed fund.Ladies colleagues, my amendment n.47 goes in this direction.As regards the proposal of a new provision that would limit investments in a single group to 15 percent, I would like to highlight - regardless of the fact that this limit is too low - that the text does not provide any definition regarding the group concept, a notion that it does not exist in European law, since it is impossible to carry out and equally impossible to control in practice.I will therefore vote against this proposal of modification.In conclusion, Mr. President allows me to remind the honorable colleagues who, although the directive needs a new look that makes the OICVMs even more attractive, it does not need a European corset that would suffocate them.Mr. President, with the advent of the euro and the growing liberalization of the capital markets, a larger and more solid European financial space has already been born, which contributes to expanding the markets and to increase the transparency of prices, but also to create a more fierce competition.The economic weight of financial transactions must also be taken into consideration, especially of those under discussion today.At the end of 1999 there were almost 15,000 investment funds recorded such as OICVM, with a global value of more than 2 billion euros, correspondent about 75 percent of the entire fundraising.So the economic weight was rightly put in the foreground by the Commission also in its proposals for projects of directives, and I must say that the Commission's proposal seemed particularly convincing to me.We all know how difficult it is to improve the regulatory framework for investment funds, and how difficult it is also to define the European passport for management companies based on specific criteria, which are interpreted by everyone in the same way.The proposal therefore represents progress from the point of view of the rules and provisions for control over markets and financial products.In my opinion, the main purpose must be the maximum consumer protection, and I consider it very important that this is explicitly affirmed in the Commission proposal, in the proposal of the European Parliament, as well as in the compromise proposals.As for OTC and derivatives products, I believe that it is not possible to evaluate the risk inherent in them, and I think that the European Parliament must let consumers know.These think that investment funds are comparable to classic savings tools and that they can offer long -term safety, so much so that they were also known with the name of investment and savings funds.The European Parliament must continue to explain that these are different things, and for this reason a minimum level of protection is needed.Why not inspire us to the minimum protection system contained in the titles trade directive, for example that of article 11, relating to correct behavior?In my opinion, this therefore represents another step forward that we can take;It would be appropriate that already on the basis of the name of a fund, consumers and investors had the opportunity to get an idea of ​​its risk structure.	it
"We should judge the Lisbon summit also in light of the contribution that it will achieve this goal.Mr. President in office for the Council, do you know how Archimedes exposed his lever theory?He said: ""Give me a point of support and I will lift the world"".Evidently, in Lisbon you will try to lift the world, or at least our world: the European one.As for the lever, she described every mechanism during her exciting intervention, exciting in many respects.The support point remains.The point of support is the means.Now, she is now in the face of an assembly in which numerous deputies in which the memory of what I would define as the white paper syndrome, formidable initiative by Jacques Delors crashed against the accounting accountant are still alive.And we would not want the same misadventure to her today, because the project that she offers us is so exciting that it can really revitalize Europe, giving her that future remembered by colleague Goebbels.But it is necessary to have the means: means that, I'm afraid, today they make you very defect.To you the task of creating them, therefore.And it is certainly not from the 2000 Agenda Corset that the necessary resources will come out.You will therefore have to induce your colleagues to ensure that the proposals that will be addressed are actually financed.An example among others - and relating to a significant aspect of what you propose - is that of the information and knowledge society.It is clear - and she illustrated it adequately - that social fracture constitutes a problem against which we must beat each other.But we need to look at you what I would call as digital fracture.In fact, who do you intend to propose this information and knowledge society?To an increasingly elderly or increasingly senescent population, to a population that remains, despite everything, poor and a population, alas, less and less educated.Therefore it will be necessary to intervene at the base, if you do not want this knowledge society to be resolved in a race for the profit of some start-up as dynamic as it is necessary.But this is not your goal.In the device you have foreseen there is an absence, which I deplo: that of public services.In the history of our European social model, public services played an essential role.Today, actually, it is no longer a time of Monopoli and the Commission has launched a process of liberalization, of opening to competition in a series of public sectors in order to make them more modern and efficient.But one cannot limit ourselves to this.It is now necessary to define more precisely, in the context given by the competition and the information society, those that will be the main public service functions for public companies tomorrow, but also for private operators of that same sector.In this regard, more incisive initiatives will be necessary, which for now do not appear in the commission's work program to which you could however impulse: this would be, in my opinion, an extremely important signal.Finally, the knowledge society is based on research and development;In this context, I would like to greet the commission's initiative aimed at creating a European research space."	it
"The measures envisaged in this resolution are however derisory to stop the policy of large industrial groups which abolish jobs and aggravate unemployment.Furthermore, these are only words, because socialist governments, which are mostly in Europe, are just as incapable as right -wing governments to take the measures that are essential to prevent layoffs.The real problem is not to find legal modalities that complicate dismissal procedures a little more, but to prohibit them.The only way to stop this infernal mechanism which produces financial added value in one side and unemployment on the other is to prohibit layoffs in all large companies that achieve profit, under penalty of expropriation, and to make public accounts public and subject them to the control of their workers and the entire population.Company must have the means to impose its own priorities on large companies and their owners, including, in the first place, the eradication of unemployment.The sums necessary to create useful jobs in public services, as well as to finance the distribution of work among all, without reduction in salary, must be taken on the profits of large companies.It is infinitely more important for the majority of the company than waste in financial operations, or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of large shareholders.I cannot support this resolution, because we mention in point 8 the case of an Italian factory whose conservation we wish, whereas at the same time, the current management of the company is advised to try to sell the factory to a manufacturer of European tires.It does not return to the European Parliament to say which factories of the fifteen member states of the European Union it is advisable to keep or close, in which it is necessary to increase or reduce the workforce, whether to keep their current implantation or relocate them, sell or not sell, or, if necessary, to decide if they have to be sold inside or outside Europe.In the end, these are areas of competence in which the European Parliament and its members do not have the legal possibility of modifying a given decision, or even having an in -depth knowledge of the situation that the factory concerned.Swedish Christians repeat that it is important that the European Union and the European Parliament are dedicated to their fundamental mission and that they do not weaken the value of their action in these areas by going beyond their skills.Potential of tourism for employment The agenda calls in common discussion (A50030/2000) of Mr. Viceconte, on behalf of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on Commission Communication: ""Increase the potential for tourism for employment - Monitoring of the conclusions and recommendations of the high -level group on tourism and employment"" [COM (1999) 0205 - C5-01121999/2115 (COS)]., rapporteur."	fr
"We need a rationalized approach to tourism, which covers all policies.I am convinced that we will progress in this area in the future, when we have a good report from the high -level working group, the support of the report of your assembly and, also, when the tourism sector is emerging from business policy.Why is it so important in this sector?Because, in business policy, emphasis will mainly be placed on helping new businesses, how to help young people more easily create their own business.This is where the potential is.If we can eliminate obstacles and reduce the cost of creating a company, facilitate access to financing and modify the attitude of the company so that it has a more positive business spirit, I am sure that the tourism sector will be the first to benefit from it.It is a problem that I hesitate to mention today because I am new in this sector.I worked in all sectors of industry and services but when you examine the organizational structure of the tourism sector, this is almost impossible.It is very difficult for a commissioner to try to work in a sector with dozen organizations whose representativeness must each time be verified.To strengthen the role of tourism in Europe, organizations should do what has been done in most economic sectors: seeking better convergence, better coordination and concentration of activities.We could then start a serious dialogue in our daily work.This is the main difficulty that we have to overcome.As for the treaty, the intergovernmental conference began this week and we do not yet know the results yet.I want to be very frank: I have not noted a great enthusiasm as to this conference or as to the proposal to expand the powers of the EU.Tourism is also on the list of subjects which are not among the new areas of competence of the EU.We will see what is going on, but for the time being, this does not seem to be the case.Finally, the Commission is delighted with the resolution that aligns the high -level group, the communication of the commission on the increase in the potential of tourism for employment and the conclusions of the related council.The general agreement concluded between the two institutions in this area should not prevent the Commission from following the most pragmatic approach to achieve our common objectives.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 9 am.(The session is lifted at 11:45 a.m.) Adoption of the minutes of the previous meeting The minutes of the session of yesterday was distributed.Are there observations?Mr. President, of course, the minutes of the yesterday session will have taken over the interventions on the said ""Strasbourg Declaration"" aimed at involving this European Parliament in considerations which, at the foot of the letter, come to the conclusion that this European deputy is a Nazi.The declaration - which, as I say, implies the European Parliament, although such a declaration has not been made before the European Parliament - is a completely inadmissible manipulation."	fr
There must be a willingness to collaborate.If, in a way, it should not be understood as an obligation, but as a disposition, possibility, which must be used by each country, then this approach is adequate.If we turn our gaze to Arym/Macedonia, we will see that with some neighboring countries this cooperation, for example, in economic matters, is very complicated, as with the Kosovo and Albania, or it is difficult from a political point of view, such as, for example, with Yugoslavia.On the other hand, collaboration with Bulgaria and, in particular, with Greece, has evolved positively, which also deserves our recognition.In this context, the European Union must reflect has begun to do so earlier this week on how part can be made, despite everything, to neighbor Yugoslavia without ignoring any criticism of this terrible regime of regional cooperation.That is why tomorrow I will present an amendment in which we declare ourselves in favor of the sanctions to fall on the regime and that, on the other hand, however, the situation of the population and the economy through economic cooperation is relieved.In this sense I am grateful I allow myself to mention it here, given that I am from a country for which the Danube flows for the reflections raised by the Commission, that is, by Commissioner Patten, but also by the Vice President Palacio, with whom I was recently in Budapest, about the possibility of making navigable to the Danube again, in order to promote a minimum economic recovery in this region, which would also be without a doubt.In my opinion, this regional approach, if I have understood it correctly, that is, as a method of contributing in some way to the economic recovery of the region, it is the appropriate approach.As I said, it cannot be interpreted as an obligation or impose itself as a previous condition.Second: I would like to make it clear that we want to open and offer AryM/Macedonia the road to the European Union.We maintain that it is illusory to believe that it would be convenient to present the application for adhesion, but we also consider it wrong to say that we will ever talk about it.AryM/Macedonia wants to get the answer that, in principle, you will have the possibility to do so when the right time comes.The country is afraid to be abandoned in a way in a dead road.In the complete reorganization of the support instruments, it does not see danger in being the last car of a train that circulates in the direction of Europe, but in which this train continues to march towards Europe and Macedonia ends up dead.But I think that Commissioner Patten will show understanding for the problem.I ask you with all insistence that this extreme will make clear in the conversations in which Third Party participates: in my opinion, Arym/Macedonia has shown so far, without any doubt that it is able to correctly use the instruments put at your disposal.Although, of course, there are changes, AryM/Macedonia will continue to show that many of the tasks faced today in Brussels, can be undertaken in the future in Skopje, in the country itself.	es
However, the possibility of including other points had been agreed, which is why the representative of the north part of the island, Rauf Denktas, proposed three new issues: the question of sovereignty, the question of measures capable of creating a climate of trust and that of the retreat of the embargo on products from the north of the island.The interviews held so far have essentially outlined two developments: first, the possibility of establishing a direct information channel between the European Union and the northern area of ​​the island - without this necessarily means its recognition as an entity with legal personality on the international level - which aims to facilitate the adoption of a community acquisis for the possible adhesion of the entire island, if you have arrived, in the meantime, to a solution of the global problem.of the division of the island.The second development, which seems important to us, is the declaration issued by the Secretary General of the United Nations at the end of the first day of interviews, in which it states that if we received a global accommodation of the situation, this would imply the recognition of the specificities of the northern island.This is the position taken by the United Nations Secretary General and is an element that we will have to take into account in our future analyzes.There are many expectations regarding the third cycle of negotiations, given the scenarios that are expected and in which the intervention of representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom is contemplated, in particular in the safety and constitutional set -up sector.These issues will be addressed in this cycle of negotiations with the mediation of the representative of the United Nations Secretary General, which should take place after carrying out the elections in the north of the island, scheduled for April 18.The Portuguese presidency of the European Union has decided, among the other, on the example of choices made by prior presidencies, to appoint a representative who holds contacts with the various parties involved.This representative has already contacted the parties and is following, in close connection with the representative of the United Nations Secretary General, the works of the various negotiating cycles.In particular, it is our intention to keep the presence of the European Union constant in this area, above all, as is obvious, since Cyprus is candidate for adhesion to the European Union on the basis of a rather advanced negotiating process, which naturally arouses many expectations and means that the European Union has an important role in this context.The orientation followed in the discussion and our participation in the discussion itself have been marked, in principle, to exploit a certain attenuation of the climate of tension, due to the conviction, apparently shared, that it is necessary to continue negotiating and that the continuation of the negotiations and the maintenance of the planned rhythm represent in themselves an essential element of hope for the achievement of a final solution.There is still another important element, which I have already mentioned at the beginning of my intervention, which concerns Turkey's commitment to contribute to the preparation of the northern adhesion of the island.We are of the opinion that it is not enough to read the conclusions of the European Council of Helsinki with attention and caution, but that one should also verify what could be the availability of the Turkish authorities to contribute to the solution of the matter.	it
It simply offers, and only where certain requirements that have a direct relationship with the activity, the possibility of selection are required.It is, therefore, a positive discrimination.In the example you have put, in the Catholic school it seems logical that teachers are Catholics.Only this type of exception can be accepted.Question No. 41 Asked by (H-0813/99): Subject: Employment Promot80% of the population, what measures or actions are expected so that these women can overcome the social barriers of their environment?Will the Commission Politics of Minimum appropriate to these limit situations propose?Will these women stay out of the new employment policies?- (El) It is evident that for the very disadvantaged areas of Europe there is cohesion policy, and for the cohesion policy are the collaboration and joint action of the structural funds, the European Social Fund and the Agricultural Fund.It must be said that the resources available for regions with problems represent a third of the total budget.These regional policies, which are carried out, following the ordered guidelines in common, of course, in each of the Member States -that is, each of the countries is responsible for the application of this program -, they pursue the objective of increasing work opportunities for both men and women.We have to say that 70% of the financing for the 2000-2006 period, which is 195,000 million euros, will be granted to the most disadvantaged regions of Europe.Regarding, now, especially to the issue of women's access to the opportunities that are presented, it must be said, first, that in the European Social Fund a whole axis of action is contemplated, which must be materialized by the Member States, which refers to equal opportunities, that is, specific policies for which the funds of the social fund and that concern women.Second, in the Leader initiative, which is still studying, special priority is granted to development strategies that propose specific support for women in small businesses in the agricultural sector, in rural tourism, in order to increase the participation and intervention of women in rural areas.Thank you, Mrs. curator, because you have given me a well -intentioned answer, made rigorously and value in your terms.However, I assure you that, with the existing means - which you allude to - we do not reach these very disadvantaged areas.Because they are areas where the deficiencies overlap and must be equated with those areas where we work in cooperation, where there is almost nothing.Therefore, my question is whether you could not study the possibility that some of the microcredit policies, which have resulted in cooperation, could also be applied to these women in very disadvantaged areas, which have everything against.	es
The goal of the current regime was to eradicate the ISA as soon as possible.The reality looks in such a way that the policy of forced emanations could not contaminate the ISA and could not eradicate even less, and while the current regulation missed its goal, it had devastating economic effects for the industry without compensation or the possibility of commercial insurance.There are essentially two changes.The first concerns the approval of vaccinations as a weapon in this fight.This is a necessary change that should go hand in hand with efforts at European level to initiate and finance studies on the development of an effective vaccine.The second change proposal provides for a step -by -step arrangement of fish from epidemics, with the infestation of the individual farms.This strategy has proven to be very effective in Norway, where the number of new diseases has decreased to a handful of cases per year after the disease reached its peak in the early 1990s with 80 to 90 cases per year.I therefore support the changes and calls proposed by the Commission to immediately accept and implement them.I also refer to the problem of compensation and require a change in decision 90/424/EEC of the Council, according to which ISA expressly included in the attached list of diseases.This enables compensation that would be paid 50 % by the Member State in question and 50 % by the European Commission.I thank the colleagues in the committee for fishing for their overwhelming support for my report, and I would like to thank my Scottish colleagues in the committee for their valuable work.I reject change applications 7 to 13, which were also rejected by the fishing committee.They are either largely superfluous or already contained in my text.In particular, I referred to the need to examine the scope of a possible interaction between breeding salmon and wild salmon, to explore the causes of the ISA and to test the wild stocks more extensively on the virus.These amendments brought by the Greens in the Grünen/Freie European Alliance Group should provide the justification for amendment.This amendment to change is completely unacceptable and inappropriate, since it not only aims to maintain the immediate foreclosure of all fish, but also prevents fish from being sold by affected farms, regardless of whether it is affected or not, and I have to emphasize that no fish affected by the disease is sold.There is no proposal for a change in this, and according to the proposed new regulation, the sale of affected fish is completely out of the question.Change applications 7 to 13 completely ignore the reality that is expressed in the blatant contrast between the situation in Scotland and the situation in Norway.In Scotland there is a draconian regime that has missed its goal.In Norway, where you have much more experience, the 100%exhaustion was abolished years ago, and thanks to a series of measures, the situation has improved immensely.It is all of our interest that in Scotland we also manage to contain the ISA and prevent further spread.	de
During a recent visit to Brussels, the representatives of these fishermen, duly accredited, made the trip from Northern Ireland and were threatened to be excluded from the meeting when they sought to plead their cause from which they had prepared the defense very well.It's scandalous, you have to pay attention to their file.It must be declared it publicly and I want to declare it publicly.I assisted in Reunion during which scientists told us that the Églefins would disappear from the Sea of ​​Ireland and during this very period, the reproduction of the Églefin knew a particular and spectacular increase in the Sea of ​​Ireland.Scientists can therefore be wrong.As I said, all the parties of Northern Ireland agree on this issue and the persons responsible for these settlement on cod quotas should reconsider this decision, the consequence of which can only be the ruin of the fishing industry in Northern Ireland and not the conservation of fish, which will affect all the fishing industries of this union.Mr. President, the reports of our colleague, Ms. Attwooll, are of great importance, as well as being able to have a maximum of data on the fishing sectors of the Member States, all the more so when the obligation for the Commission is closer to developing a report on the revision of the common fishing policy, in 2002. However, the fact that these obligations of updating and sending are simply optional andVery different from each other can distort the final objective of the commission's proposal.Thus, - as we have already pointed out here - it has been highlighted that, within the framework of POPs, the countries which respected them to the letter and transmitted their data to the Commission were strongly injured compared to those who did not respect them or who simply did not provide this data.It should also be noted that the Member States do not all have the same number of data.Some have different sectors and, given the volume of data they must transmit, they could feel injured compared to those who have a less large volume if they are imposed on them the same deadlines.Consequently, in our opinion it is necessary to adjust these delivery times.As we have also already pointed out here, many of this data also have a confidential character because they concern the very competitiveness of the sectors involved and their companies.It is therefore necessary to act with great caution in this area and guarantee the confidentiality of this data.Some of them are inappropriate, as has also been reported, especially those relating to business taxation.Anyway, Mr. President, and as I do not want to expand more, aware of time problems, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur, Ms. Attwooll, for the considerable work that she has shot in our committee.I would like to congratulate Ms. Attwooll in my turn and say that I approve of most of her words.I consider as a weakness of the proposal the fact that the establishment of reports is not compulsory within all the Member States.I cannot understand a proposal to establish a regulation that certain Member States could dodge without incurring a fine and I can not understand either within a European Union which is only self -sufficient in fishery matters only 50 %, there is highly sensitive information and that by establishing necessary reports, the national or regional interests of certain fishermen's states or communities are endangered.	fr
This is indispensable for a correct and reliable determination of the deficits.This adaptation will enable a more precise assessment of the deficits and debt levels in the Member States.This technical adaptation will have a very concrete effect on the actual position of the countries, since the data is automatically changed according to the public deficit.I also welcome the fact that the deficits for the 1999 accounting year, which is to be published in March 2000, will already be created according to the new ESVG, that is, that the analysis is based in an economic point of view relevant, consolidated aggregates.However, let me use this debate briefly to appeal to all governments and political parties to do everything so that the procedure in the event of an excessive deficit never has to be initiated.It is good that the procedure exists.The procedure is necessary because it gives our criteria the necessary seriousness and credibility.The citizens ask: What if the criteria are not fulfilled?With the procedures and other measures, we can prove that we are serious about the criteria and with ourselves.A second essential point is the question that we have to do everything we can not only prevent the excessive deficits, but also have public deficits.I know what I'm talking about and let me say at the end why I'm so happy that we are doing the debate!In my own country we have a debate about whether the information that the former finance minister has given the deficit corresponds to the actual reality.In my own country, in Austria, new elections were necessary in 1995 to fulfill the Maastricht criteria and to persuade the political partner to rethink.I also have to say that in 2000, since so much is said about us, the coalition negotiations with the SPÖ - I say, unfortunately - have failed because the negotiated savings and consolidation program was brought down by the socialist party.Not least because of this, the new government in Austria had to be formed because the ÖVP wants to continue to be a guarantee for the stability course, because the ÖVP continues to ensure compliance with the Maastricht criteria and the reduction of public deficit, as we have agreed here.President!It is gratifying if statistical data are not only reliable, but also comparable.This is particularly important for European integration and the completion of the internal market.That is why we have a politically substantial report here, for which we sincerely congratulate the rapporteur.The report also gives rise to some political comments.The stability pact is a fact in Europe.With this stability pact, all countries participating in the euro have undertaken to strive for a household in the medium term that is balanced or has a low surplus.Of course, this does not mean that in the event of an unfavorable course of the economy, it shouldn't be a little more or less, but a long and medium term must be a balance or an excess.The more solid the position of the participating countries, the stronger the euro will be.As a result, an exceeding of the three percent standard will rarely occur, not even under unfavorable economic conditions, at least the reasoning is.	de
The two closely related important resources of the Atlantic coast, fishing and tourism are both severely impaired.In all likelihood, the season will only bring in losses, which would result in a severe crisis at the end of the year.It is therefore completely justified that our parliament accepts a new resolution to which our faction made a very extensive contribution.In it, some points are put in the foreground, which are considered absolutely primarily on site.The first point is that the cause must be fully responsible.In our resolution, the application of two principles is required.Firstly, that of the principle that the polluter has to pay for the cleaning, because it is unacceptable that the cleansing of the coastal sections dirty by a tanker load does not take place at the expense of the owner of the load, but at the expense of the local authorities, i.h.the taxpayer, i.e. the injured party.Second, the application of the cause principle.The responsibility of the polluter is required in our resolution, must also extend to fishing, marine culture and aquaculture companies.This is of fundamental importance and includes that the cause of the compensation of those affected does not depend on the upper limit set by the FIPOL, i.e.h.can limit at the arbitrary discretion of the large oil companies.If the fipol upper limit is not sufficient -and it is obviously too low -it must be raised.This is also required in our resolution.If the raising is still not sufficient, the polluter must pay for the remaining damage himself.It would be extremely unfair if an oil company, which had won 10 billion francs this year, would refuse to pay their victims, who are in the excessive majority of small businesses and employees, 100%compensation.The suffering population, Mr. Commissioner, expects concrete signs of solidarity at community level.The Commission calls on our resolution to take the necessary measures in order to support the damage to the damage in the fishing sector affected by the effects of the catastrophe.Blue Europe, the GFP, today have to make it clear that in addition to the constraints they impose the fishermen, solidarity is not an empty word for them.The European Union must also contribute to the restoration of natural environmental conditions in the affected wetlands and coastal zones, which are of biological importance for the entire Union.Mr. Fischler has just explained that he will positively accept applications from France, which I can only welcome.We have to play a pioneering role in this important question of sea pollution.20 years after the amoco Cadix disaster, there is still negligence and irresponsibility with new oil pollution in Europe.This time the inertia has to be overcome.A general framework in the area of ​​marine safety must be determined immediately, which takes into account the principle of subsidiarity, and the vicious circle of generally widespread irresponsibility must be put to an end.Mr. President, the economy of the French Atlantic coast is badly damaged by the oil pollution due to the accident of Erika.The fishermen, mussel breeders, oyster breeders, tourist companies and the local and regional regional authorities are impatiently waiting for help and the elimination of the wreck, from which oil still exits and is therefore a real time bomb.	de
The truth is that the European Parliament remains without the confidence or even the interest of national public opinions, which insist not to think of Europe, as evidenced by the level of abstention in recent elections.Therefore, what is about strengthening the mechanisms used in cooperation between the governments of the Member States, conferring more coherence and transparency and a more democratic character.We welcomed Romano Prodi's effort to improve the public reputation of the commission and the need to be concerned with the PE and the Council.But we consider that the priority should be for the reform of government cooperation mechanisms, particularly through the creation of a Council of Ministers for Europe that, in coordination with each other and with the other European institutions, will be responsible for transforming into concrete actions the political decisions of European councils.Corrie Report (A5-0032/2000) Mrs. President, the work of the ACP-EU Joint Assembly in 1999 has been marked by greater concern about the continuity of the cooperation model resulting from the Lomé agreements.Already in 1994, through a first resolution that had had the wide participation of our colleague Domique Souchet, the joint assembly was alarmed by the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay Round, which had entered into contradiction with the principle of community preference itself, necessary for said cooperation.For two years, these fears are concretized.The banana contentious constitutes its clearest expression.Developing countries are asked to adapt to the liberalization of exchanges, despite the fragility of their economies.While Mr. Corrie's report denounces this situation very well and reaffirms the adhesion of the Joint Assembly to the Lomé model, does not sufficiently emphasize emphasis, on the other hand, in a second problem that, in fact, also comes from the free -ambist error: the incoherence of the regional commercial agreements concluded by the European Union.The cooperation agreement with South Africa is the best example of this.The Council has approved this agreement negotiated by the Commission, when even the agricultural chapter, which is essential, was not completed.As our colleague Paul-Marie Coûteaux said very well in his intervention yesterday and in his amendment proposals, one wonders what is the political coherence of this blank check.This is very worrying, especially when a similar agreement seems to be outlined with Mexico.Nor can the speaker support when he asks for the incorporation of the European Development Fund to the Community Budget.We want to maintain the clear commitment and responsibility of each Member State that allows the intergovernmental nature.Unfortunately, there are too many examples of deviation from the collective aid that nobody feels responsible, and we do not want to extend to this disastrous system.Mrs. President, I greet Mr. Corrie's report because it represents a balanced evaluation of the work done by the Assembly during the past year.The report comes to us just after an agreement has been reached on the renewal of the current Lomé Convention, which expires at the end of this month.	es
There is no freedom without rules.We have dismissed so-called Master-Feeder structures.These foster funds exist in the United States, but in a space knowing only a supervisory authority and a single jurisdictional system.In the still fragmented European market, such structures would not fail to create problems.Socialists, like the committee, of elsewhere, doubt the opportunity to authorize investment funds to also invest in so -called over the counter derivatives, negotiated programs over the overcrowding.As these operations generally do not fall under prudential control, the risks are all the more obvious.In order to supervise the risks for investors, the socialist group has introduced amendments offering safeguard clauses, both quantitative and qualitative.By adopting these amendments, the Parliament will authorize the use of OTC derivatives, while limiting the risks for private investors.Mr. President, we are currently talking a lot about the principle of good governance.This principle should not only guide the public sector, but also the private sector, in particular financial companies.Mr. President, the objective we pursue by creating a framework for SICAVs and other UCITS is to ensure investors the best and as sure as possible.This is why I want to talk about the question of derivatives in my intervention.I am firmly convinced that used with caution, derivatives can make it more safe and higher yields.Despite the risk image they inspire, derivatives are usually used by portfolio managers as a shield.A contract which reports, for example, a large sum in the event of a decline in the NASDAQ or the CAC 40 stock index causes additional payment from the investor in the case of an increase.Is it speculation?Absolutely not.Imagine that you have taken several months to build a portfolio of actions of companies in which you trust: they have good management, good prospects and represent an interesting investment.Then, you fear the occurrence of a collapse of the stock market as a whole like that of 1987. You have the option of liquidating everything against species, but this would ruin the fruit of your research in favor of the winners.This would also imply all the transaction costs incurred by the sale of your shares, then by their repurchase after the stock market cracker.The solution consists in turning to a derivative which reports in the event of a fall of the Nasdaq or the CAC 40. But a custom-made derivative or an over-the-counter, cheaper and perhaps protecting you against a relative loss of your wallet compared to the index, still allows you to keep your wallet and actions, but also to protect yourself against the risks of collapse.In exchange, you also give up market increases.In this case, which is perhaps the one we most commonly meet with portfolio managers with derivatives, you reduce your potential gains but also your potential risks.This is the desirable development of a well -managed fund.Experience shows that investors take advantage of a liberal and flexible approach to regulation.	fr
(The session, interrupted at 13. 05 hours, resumes at 3:00 p.m.) black tide in France in accordance with the agenda, the commission of the commission on black tide is proceeded in France.He has the floor, on behalf of the commission, Mrs. de Palacio to open the debate.Mr. President, I intervene in the name of the PPE, but also in my capacity as chosen Breton, directly affected and dismayed by these events.Together with Françoise Grossetête and the PPE, we have submitted a resolution proposal.Hard us here today with a commitment proposal, which is happy.Erika's wreck is actually a European issue, on the one hand, because it mutilates and dirties some of the most beautiful European beaches with very serious consequences for tourism, sea professionals and environmental defenders and, on the other, because what is in question is regulations and control, which have an obvious European natural dimension.A similar catastrophe, almost certainly, would not have occurred off the American coast.Because?Because the Americans knew how to learn the lesson of the catastrophe of Exxon Valdez and because in 1990 they established the Oil Pollution Act that has both a broader scope of responsibilities, because it can imply the responsibility of the charter, it is more binding and above all it is better controlled through various regulations and, in particular, due to the existence of the body of North American guard.Without having had such provisions, I repeat, the catastrophe would undoubtedly have occurred.That is why we believe that the applicable texts must be reviewed and, in particular, the 1992 protocol, which has exonerated the charterers, in this case to the charter oil tanker, of all responsibility.Now, if the charter is exonerated, it will certainly be implied less in the controls that are the responsibility of the oil companies.Therefore, you have to review the regulations and thank you, Mrs. curator, who has indicated all the current insufficiencies of the European provisions.On the other hand, as you have said, we must above all to reinforce the controls: the controls of the state of the pavilion and those of the classification societies.You have told us that Rina Society is an Italian classification record recognized by the Commission.Under what conditions is this recognition made?What are the guarantees of reliability?The commission will send a mission.We expect the results with great interest.We must also strengthen the controls of maritime authorities and control in European ports.There is, it must be remembered, a Paris memorandum that implies a minimum of control, a quarter of the ships that scale in European ports must be controlled by the maritime authorities of the country in question.This obligation is not respected either in France or in many other European countries.Because?What are the consequences that you have taken or what does the commission plan to get this situation?I also consider strengthening the control of the charter, in this case, the oil tanker.	es
"Mr. President, first of all I would like to thank Commissioner Patten and show him my esteem for the observations he made here today, in particular in relation to the role of the European Union in the peace process, and for having reiterated that ours is not only a role of ""bankers"" of the entire operation.I was deeply disappointed in learning this week the news of the suspension of the talks between Israel and Syria.I sincerely hope that a compromise can be achieved to overcome this obstacle so that peace negotiations can resume as soon as possible.However, we cannot deny that some positive political progress have been carried out in the Middle East.The fact that, for the first time in their respective stories, the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister recently sat around the same table in the United States is a signal that the old hatreds and animosity can be overcome.Political leaders must prove to be authentic courage to create conditions that can lead to a global peaceful solution in the Middle East.I know that even if it is possible to reach an agreement between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will still be faced with a strong opposition to each new agreement with Syria in any future referendum.The colonists of the Golan hills will ask for compensation and safety guarantees must be provided.If Syria were willing to offer concessions on the issue of security, the prospects of a positive solution of the Israel/Syria issue could be promising.Regarding the problem of Palestine, I recognize that some difficulties still remain regarding the implementation of certain aspects of the Wye Plantation agreement.The main problems for the moment include the difficulties of withdrawing troops, as well as the transfer of the territories.The reduced number of Palestinian prisoners liberated and the fact that the Israeli government seems to want to suspend the execution of works relating to construction permits already granted, as well as deny the release of new authorizations, places further obstacles.These issues have clearly slowed down any progress in negotiations relating to the final statute, even if, I believe, these interviews cannot be postponed indefinitely.For the moment, the main difficulty in facing the negotiations seems to be the fact that the Palestinians insist that first of all an agreement must be achieved on the issue of the border, while the Israeli government says that it must be defined as this aspect only after finding a solution to the problem of settlements and security.Currently, both parties seem to have recognized that nothing will be agreed until everything is agreed.In conclusion, while other countries in the Middle East have expressed reservations about the global direction of the peace process, now that the Syrian government has been involved in it, Egypt and other countries in the region are willing to move forward.I sincerely hope that, in the interest of an improvement in the safety and quality of life of the populations who live in the Middle East, all the key protagonists quickly fulfill steps forward, in the immediate future, in order to reach a global agreement on all the fundamental issues that must be resolved."	it
As for the questions and problems asked by the ladies and men and men, I have summarized them in four complexes.First, the expansion of the subject areas.There are four, as well as in the employment strategy, namely employment ability, entrepreneurial spirit, adaptability and equal opportunities.We agree to the expansion of these subject areas in accordance with the proposals submitted by the parliament.Furthermore, the fear was expressed that a country could possibly only use the entirety of the funds for one of the categories affected by discrimination.I would like to reply to the fact that the initiative clearly formulates that the Member States must propose a thematic action for each group affected by discrimination.The second point is flexibility and simplification.I agree with Ms. Lynne - the initiative is really composed in a very complicated and extremely bulky language.The services are therefore already in the process of checking the text, sharing it more clearly and making it easier to understand.As far as flexibility is concerned, we suggest development partnerships and cooperation, both at a geographical level, in which different groups work together in a certain geographical area to eliminate discrimination on the labor market, as well as thematic, that is, that can be cooperated, for example, in a specific business sector.Here the Member States have considerable scope to adapt the development partnerships to their special conditions.The prerequisite is, of course, that the cooperation between the Member States works and there is networking to promote the exchange of experiences.After all, I would like to go into technical support.We strive to ensure that four aspects can be financially promoted: firstly, the preparation, secondly the implementation, thirdly, the interoperability so that there is an exchange of experiences, and fourthly the technical support.Since there were numerous speeches in this regard and great interest in how the technical support is granted, I would like to point out that external offices are used.As Mr. Barnier explained, the Commission's employees cannot cope with the entire work that has previously been done by external employees.The goal is to create large promotional groups at national and European level that are advertised, and a complete description of the project for which external help is required, as well as a detailed description of the product that we expect from the BAT so that the work can be checked and evaluated.Let me underline that it is extremely important to drive this initiative as quickly as possible, both given the political circumstances and because we consider it essential that it starts as planned and that we are now equipped in the end of 2000.Thank you very much, Ms. Commissioner.I will send my colleagues in the Presidium and in the responsible committees to send their wish for a quick naming of the rapporteurs for the dossiers they mentioned.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.(The session is closed at 8.40 p.m.) Approval of the protocols of the two previous meetings The minutes of the session of Thursday, February 3, and Monday, February 14th, were distributed.The protocol of February 3 has already been distributed in Brussels.Maybe that's why some colleagues didn't have it yet.	de
Water is a renewable and limited natural resource.He is scarce when not well administered and when geographical and climatic conditions are not favorable.In the Union, that issue is decisive in the Mediterranean region, but also in other countries in Europe, in which we witness a progressive desiccation of wet areas.Delicate, wet or arid areas, inequalities between the states, inequalities between the different regions within the states, climatic, economic, geographical, geological particularities, are many other evidence that we want to remember, but that they should not lead to distortions of the competition in the community.However, we have presented amendments to remember the importance of the specific relationship of agriculture with water, capital of occupation and valorization of the territory.There is no doubt that the needs of agriculture in the south are far superior, so that-might must take into account that specificity.For the rest, not only in the states of the Union solutions are sought for these problems: in October the countries of the Euromediterranean association resolutely requested in Turin a Marshall Plan of the water on the southern banks of the Mediterranean.Fortunately, we are not in that situation.However, in Europe there are droughts, desertification in certain regions, but also floods, as the directive underlines.In France we have suffered recently and also in the Rhin Valley and in central Europe.We need this directive as an essential element of a sustainable development policy, which must make compatible, among themselves, the different uses of water.But it is necessary to integrate into that new management the protection and conservation of biodiversity.Anyway, the water file will not be completed today.Indeed, the question of extension and climatic evolutions open new perspectives.Mr. President, good quality water perhaps reaches in this century a strategic importance even greater than oil.This is a sufficient reason to thank Mrs. Lienemann for her dedication in favor of keeping surface waters in good condition.It seems quite complicated to adopt an adequate European legislative framework.With the Framework Directive on Water Policy we want to end the dispersion of the legislation in this regard in the Union.But despite everything we have not been able to prevent the directive from being extensive and complicated.This requires that the agencies in charge of their application be very careful when applying it.Specifically, it is necessary to take advantage of the possibilities posed by the approach of the hydrological basins to implement a specific policy by the Member States and the organizations responsible for the water management.The most important objectives remain to fight against the contamination of surface and underground waters, the protection of ecosystems, the promotion of sustainable use of water, the fight against floods and droughts, and end the discharged of dangerous substances in surface waters.With regard to the discharge of substances in surface waters, I think that the objectives of the council are too little committed and too little ambitious.The present proposal of the Environment Commission to reduce discharges to a level close to zero seems commendable and deserving of support.	es
"Third, we are delighted that the common position has introduced, for the first time, the development and regional planning of the coastal areas among the priorities of Life ""Environment"".However, Mr. President, Messrs deputies, despite all his merits, the LIFE III regulation fails in the field which is necessarily the most important for a financial instrument: his budget.By maintaining their proposal of 613 million euros as a reference amount for the period 2000-2004 and taking into account the European Parliament proposal of 850 million euros, the Commission and the Council make a decision which, in our opinion no longer meets the just and rational criteria that they had rightly introduced into the other provisions of Life III.As far as we are concerned, the Commission and the Council must know that we will not give up our intention to provide LIFE with the budget which it deserves and which best guarantees the environmental results that such an instrument aims to achieve.We justify our opinion on the basis of four very simple arguments.First, Life is the only direct financial instrument intended for the promotion of the environment in the European Union.There is no other.Second, Life is an instrument that has produced good results, which has enabled the development of innovative methods and techniques and its execution rate is excellent.Third, Life's budget has decreased in real terms and has not followed the dynamism and creativity of demand.Fourth, having regard to the credit it grants to Life, the European Parliament has provided more and more important allocations for this program in its annual budget.Also the approval of the proposal defended by the Commission and the Council would lead to an unacceptable reversal of this trend.However, our concern does not focus on the only budgetary question.Climate change and water policy are problems that are very concerned about European citizens and have been the subject of sustained attention from the European Parliament.This is why it is, in our opinion, essential to approve our amendments 5 and 6, which aim to erect the sustainable management of groundwater and surface, as well as the reduction of greenhouse gases to the rank of ""environment"" Life objectives.A final word to congratulate Ms. Lienemann for her report and tell her that we will vote in favor of her amendments on comitology, because, if we prefer, as he has clearly appeared within the Environment Commission, that LIFE's follow -up is ensured by an advisory committee, we do not wish to contribute to the adoption of the solution of the council, which is resolutely less good.Mr. President, dear colleagues, Life is the most important instrument, the only financial instrument, in fact, of the European Union which is exclusively devoted to the environment.This is to say if this tool should live up to our ambitions, ambitions that have a price, of course."	fr
But, regardless of that, we would like to underline that the strengthening of the coherence of the policies of the European Union in the current framework and at the current situation that the Union lives presupposes a serious reflection on some aspects related to the dynamics of the European Union itself: of course, the internal dynamics of the European Union.We know that the European Union lives its own dynamic that follows above all from the Amsterdam treaty, which strengthens its political dimension, which does not cease to have an important consequence in relation to the budget of the coherence of development policies.We will also have to wait for the development of the works of the Intergovernmental Conference, see what dynamics it is adopted regarding the extension to verify to what the internal dynamics of the European Union is oriented in the sense of strengthening the coherence of its policies and, in particular in development, it contributes to adequate institutional agreements also with a view to that objective.Second aspect to consider regarding the coherence of policies: development policy within the framework of the foreign policy of the Union.We know that the Union lives a new dimension of its foreign policy, we know that with the creation of the high representative, of the rapid intervention force, of the Military Management Center of the crises, there is a whole dynamic of affirmation of the European Union that we cannot underestimate when we face the role of development policies and also that there are aspects related to political dialogue, the adoption of common positions or actions, the preparation of common strategies, the pretrial diplomacy,Development of Regional Capacity for Prevention and Crisis Management.There is no doubt that all these aspects, in their application and in their development, will make no important contributions to strengthening the role of development policies within the framework of the foreign policy of the European Union.We must say that, also at that level, at the level of the European Union, the framework of the development policy within the framework of foreign policy will undoubtedly have to travel the same path as the development policies in many Member States, within the framework of its external policies, and its affirmation necessarily presupposes the need to strengthen decision mechanisms and institutional structures of PESC media, which allow a better articulation between the instruments of the policy of development and those of the policy of development and those of the policy.In this context, we have the conviction that we need to move from a post -colonial paradigm to another European development policy, knowing, as we know, that in the latter this policy has been very conditioned by those of some member states, depending on their postcolonial references.Third aspect to consider: the policy of the European Union and that of the Member States.The coherence of policies at the level of the European Union presupposes without a doubt a better coordination of those of the Member States with that of the European Union in development and, if it were not possible to establish better mechanisms of coherence among the nationals, it would be undoubtedly more difficult to reflect on a framework of greater coherence for the European Union policy in development.	es
The amendment 4 specifies that the object of the exercise is the evaluation of fishery resources in general.The amendment 7 calls the commission to report annually on the use made of the data collected in accordance with the regulation.It is also aimed at giving greater impulse to the process through faster and faster notifications by the commission on the progress of the data collection program in general.The other area of ​​concern is relative to the data series that must be collected in accordance with the regulation.First, with respect to economic data, amendment 2 introduces two modifications.One tries to ensure that the requested data is not more detailed than necessary, so that they serve the objective pursued.The other replaces a reference to the benefits from sales and other income, subsidies, perceived interests, etc., only for a reference to the volume of sales.It is considered that without these modifications, Member States could incur too high and unwanted costs in the data collection exercise and that serious problems of confidentiality could also arise.In conjunction with these modifications, amendment 5 eliminates a reference to the corresponding accounting headings.Secondly, with respect to data on the environment, the original proposal speaks only of biological and economic information.The Commission, however, has made it clear that it is proposed to carry out pilot studies and projects that have a broader environmental character.He has also clarified that he could desire to expand the range of data collected by Member States at a later stage.The amendment 3 introduces in the scope of the current regulation the necessary data types to monitor the changes that occur in the aquatic ecosystems.This will undoubtedly facilitate the introduction of a new regulation related to environmental data and can even make it unnecessary.It should be stressed that the amendment does not require in any way that the commission includes the collection of this type of data or in the minimum program or in the expanded program that establishes at the time.Simply contemplate the possibility that the commission will do so if you want.As already said, the Council's decision proposal is divided into two parts.The first is relative to financial participation in the expenses made by the Member States in the execution of community programs.The second is to allow the financial commission itself to studies and pilot projects.There are some minor amendments: amendment 2 seeks to ensure that financial participation in expenses made by Member States can cover not only costs derived from data collection, but also those related to their management, collection, globalization, etc.The amendments 3 and 6 have the objective of more flexible, given that Member States will have to wait for the publication of the Execution Regulation to know the exact content of the programs, as well as to adapt the deadlines to the dates and the regulations.The amendments 4 and 5 are aimed at ensuring that financial information is presented regularly to the budgetary authority.And what is more significant, in amendment 1, the Fisheries Commission accepts the recommendation of the Budget Commission in the sense that the financing should be placed under heading 1 (B), and not under heading 3 of the financial perspectives.	es
I note, finally, that we had asked, since July, an energetic action on the part of the Council and the Commission for the release of the three thousand prisoners Kosovars, Mrs. Brovina, Mr. Kurti and Mr. Hoti.I note that the union is preparing to remove certain sanctions and that in return, we did not have a single release of these prisoners.For what ?Mr. President, the events that occur in Mitrovica, Kosovo, are atrocious and unacceptable.Violence generates violence and revenge causes revenge.The quota of the police forces sent is insufficient to prevent these massacres.The chief police commissioner, Mr. Svend Frederiksen, expressed his despair, specifying that he was always missing more than half of the promised workforce.He has less than 2,000 agents when he had been promised nearly 5,000. The police workforce must be such that it is seen in the landscape, that the population believes that it can stop the violations and it must be of a magnitude such that it is able to shed light on the crimes committed and to sanction the culprits, failing which the door is open to a carjustice.This is why it is necessary to train local police officers, and it was planned that 2,000 to 3,000 police officers will be formed, but the police force still have only 200 agents trained and capable of contributing to investigative work.We have already seen, a year ago, which happens when we do not respect the concluded agreements and the decisions made.I was in Kosovo on October 27, 1998 when the Serbs withdrawn.It had been agreed that 1,800 OSCE observers would be sent to guarantee peace.A month later, they were just a handful.At Christmas, there were perhaps 100 and, in the spring, there was still only a tiny fraction of the workforce that had been promised.The violations could not even be noted.Then the war arrived and the observers withdrew.My question is therefore the following, Mr. Commissioner: Don't really do anything to prevent a rehearsal of our nonsense in Europe?Can you not guarantee a strong police contingent of 5,000 men as well as the training of local agents, who could obviously easily elucidate crimes than foreign agents?I will add another question: when do you think they are in place?And when will you delegate more responsibilities to local democratic forces?I ask this last question, because this is the solution that we must consider as quickly as possible so that peace has a chance to settle.Those who are in contact with the reality of Kosovo are of the same opinion: a tragic and desperate situation of democratic emptiness and impossibility of cohabitation between the various ethnic groups - Mitrovica is a tragic example.The policy led by Milosevic in Kosovo before the NATO military intervention was certainly condemnable and the demands for autonomy of the Kosovo regions emanating from non -violent forces of the time of Rugova were justified.	fr
In the future, the financing will no longer take place from three funds, but only from the EAGFL orientation.It will therefore be necessary to increase the quality of the programs, because the EAGFL should be an effective financial instrument.Higher precision When selecting, will lead to a higher effectiveness, because the money should not be wasted without having a plan.I would particularly like to highlight the point that forms an approach to an integrated and environmentally friendly development strategy.In this area there is great employment potential for the future in rural areas, and we have to use it if we want to show people in the country a perspective.Therefore, politics for rural areas is more than one policy only for the farmers.Leader+ is intended to complement existing programs, avoid overlaps and double financing and thus contribute to the most extensive development.In this way, Leader+, together with the programs of Regulation 1257/99, can underline the second pillar of the GAP even better and have a best possible effect for the entire rural space.President!Dear colleagues!I am not always happy about such a hustle and bustle of parliament, but the Urban program is one of the best examples because it was created on the initiative of Parliament.The Commission would have hired Urban, but in this case the parliament had the longer arm.The continuation of the program is to be welcomed, as it has produced good results at the local level.The problems of the urban areas of Europe are increasing.Fortunately, we are now in agreement with the Commission.Much of the population of Europe lives in cities.The resulting problems are important questions of regional policy that go back to a variety of causes.The risk of infrastructural neglect is great.In many English and French cities there are already slums in which there are incredible abuses.None of us want South American favelas in Europe.We have to act now before it's too late.Cities are also of great importance for the European economy.We always encounter the same basic European problem: our economic life motivates the individual inadequate and is not dynamic enough.We need a strong economy so that we can take care of our fellow human beings and our environment.This is not about politics, but about the simple logic of life.When using the funds, it turns out to be positive to concentrate the means, because the distribution according to the watering can principle seeps away too much in the sand.We now have to accept the solution to the problems in the small and medium -sized cities, since they lack a sufficiently critical mass.This could also give the rural areas surrounding them more development pace.It is often forgotten that the problems of cities and rural regions are related to each other.One basis is always the task of promoting innovation and entrepreneurship, since the mass movement emanating from individuals renews a region from the inside.The granting of financial aid without an economy that is already on its own feet would mean pouring water into the fountain: drinking water would be there for the moment, but tomorrow the fountain will be dry again.	de
We cannot exclude the accidents 100 percent, but prevention must be optimal and in this sense the coherent directive that we are examining is an important step.I hope that liberal colleagues will reflect from here to tomorrow if - also for reasons of parliamentary identity - give us their second reading vote, as it happened in the first, because in conciliation we will have to go there anyway and there will be the availability of the advice.I believe that tomorrow we should approve the amendments as a large majority as they were discussed in the commission, for environmental reasons and also linked to the competition, but also in line with what we decided two months ago in January.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, honorable speaker, my compliments for his relationship.As you have just indicated, the directive in question is of the utmost urgency.The ports will have the obligation to have structures for waste collection and the necessary checks will finally be performed.In addition, a very important element, the Member States will have to impose on both failure to comply with the rules.All this will benefit the environment.As of now, even anticipating the entry into force of the directive, the first investments are being carried out.For example, in Antwerp, near where I live, a new large system is being built.In a sense we can say that the directive is already making its effects feel.Only on one point our opinions diverge, Coma also indicated the honorable Jarzembowski, that is, on the method to be applied for the charge of costs.Nobody opposes the principle according to which those who pollute must pay.But the question is if he has to automatically pay the full amount by integrating it into high anchor taxes, or if it is not better to opt for the flexible rule proposed by the Council.It is necessary to see in which of the two systems the best economic incentive is integrated.I had the opportunity to talk about it with several people and I must say that the positions are somewhat divergent, as well as the habits.There are even different systems and percentages in different ports of the same region.There are also ports that, if I can say so, change percentage at the last minute.Therefore I believe that this parliament should not be fixed on a fixed percentage.A flexible system under these conditions, as you said, must include a substantial contribution to costs, and 0.01 percent is clearly not a substantial contribution.It must also constitute an encouragement, given that a part of the system remains flexible and open, in order to be able to operate in compliance with the environment, provided that the Commission exercises due checks and ensures that the system works.If the objectives of the directive should not be achieved, you must, lady commissioner, intervene at the executive commission by proposing the necessary changes to ensure the functioning of the system.Ladies colleagues, it is our duty to save this directive what costs, we must not let it escape.I hope we will not endanger the entire directive only because of a matter of principle linked to a single point.	it
The common position, adopted by the Commission and then confirmed by the Environment Commission, but which was very difficult to accepted by the Council, satisfies environmental requirements so that I find very strange and incomprehensible that members of the Environment Commission have deposited amendments aimed at reducing environmental requirements and attenuating the responsibility of automakers.If these amendments are adopted, I believe that the credibility of the assembly in environmental issues will be seriously shaken.The Assembly has so far played a positive role as a catalyst in favor of environmental protection, but an adoption of the amendments by Mr. Florenz and Mr. Lange would constitute a negative factor for environmental protection in Europe.On the other hand, if we attenuate the responsibility of producers in this case, this will result from serious consequences in the cases that we will examine later in other areas, for example with regard to the future directive on electronic and computer scraps.This is why I warmly recommend that deputies ignore their membership in one or the other group and to vote against all the amendments to the common position which aim to weaken environmental standards and to restrict the responsibility of the manufacturers.This is how we will obtain a result valid in terms of the environment.Mr. President, this excellent directive will put an end to the discharge of old cars, will encourage recycling and, above all, will encourage manufacturers to design cars that can easily be recycled.The whole thing is to know who will pay costs.Whatever the system adopted, the price will ultimately be passed on to consumers.The best way to achieve our environmental objectives is to make manufacturers our instrument both for the collection of money and for elimination, as well as for recycling cars.The manufacturers brought, using subterfuges, Mr. Florenz and Mr. Lange to offer amendments that seriously weaken these proposals.Do not be abused by car manufacturers!If you want to fully benefit from this directive, make use of your vote to reject these amendments.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, dear colleagues, this debate, contrary to what we could think, is not of a technical order.He became eminently political.Yesterday we honored our institution with a political debate.Today, if 314 deputies yielded to the power of the lobby of certain car manufacturers, we would dishonor ourselves.By asking consumers to ensure half of the cost of recovery of out of use vehicles, as stipulated in amendment 38, while the common position requires that the entire recovery is the responsibility of the producer, for the first time, the Parliament would not present itself as the guarantor of the defense of consumers and European citizens, it would in a way become a resonance fund of lobbies.We cannot accept it.It would be a precedent that would leave the door open to all pressures in many other areas.It would also be the first time that the European Parliament has weakened a position of the Council, while in general I believe that we mainly criticize a position of the council.	fr
This way of acting in order to involve all European institutions and citizens is transparent and effective.This white paper is a response to the challenges that enlargement poses to us.This obliges us to re -study the functioning of all our institutions, to re -study our policies -all our policies -, to re -examine especially what we will have to continue to do, at the level of the Union, when we count twenty -five or thirty member states, and what will be more appropriate to do at the national level, at the regional level and at the level of local administrations.But enlargement is not the only one to push us to this new reflection.As I have just said, the globalization of economics and politics itself also encourages us.We have to govern Europe so as to be more effective, closer to citizens, promoting everyone's participation, starting first with the great problem of female participation.One of the major differences that appeared in the comparison made during this period between Europe and the United States is not so much the mobility of workers or the risk problem at risk, but rather the participation of women in economic life, much stronger participation in the United States than with us.This is an area where Europe has always been at the forefront and we must lead to a deep, open reflection, and all institutions - commission, parliament, advice - will have to think of their own role, their own policies.We will therefore immediately get back to work on this white paper, even if we will have to wait for the results of the intergovernmental conference to complete it.It cannot therefore be presented before spring 2001. It will not be a book of philosophy, but a concrete book, rich in specific proposals.We - The Commission - are the first to know that we must completely review our organization.This is why we will do two things: we will employ ourselves and we are already fully employing internal reform, and we will re -study our policies in depth.I asked all the commissioners - and we will repeat this request in an even more analytical way - to define all the activities that can be abandoned.The Commission must determine what its basic activities are, those on which it must concentrate, and give others non -essential activities in order to identify new resources and have a more correct relationship and to achieve greater cooperation with countries, regions and local communities.We will therefore release other resources, but the moment will come - I fear it, and I want to say it here in front of you - where these resources that we are already identifying will no longer prove to be sufficient to allow us to face our new responsibilities.I am thinking of expanding, the new sector of justice and domestic affairs, health and environmental problems.When we have spent all our resources, I will not hesitate to come and ask you for others, but I say today that, we will not accept new tasks if the financial means to assume them do not follow because there would be no consistency between the missions to be accomplished and the resources available.	fr
"Another example: cocoa.The European Union wants to authorize the use in the chocolate of a 5 percent of alternative fats, in order to harmonize the internal market.This percentage could also be zero, and the internal market would still be harmonized the same.But fixing this share to 5 percent - it seems that this is the basic orientation - it almost certainly means damaging hundreds of thousands of farmers in developing countries that cultivate cocoa.Still, it seems that you want to go in that direction.I wonder if we really realize what we are doing.This is a typical example of a policy that makes our fellow citizens say: but are they combining, there in Brussels?It seems that the interests of European companies are more important than our principles, our coherence and the interests of developing countries.Also as regards countries subjected to penalties or embargo, shocking cases can be mentioned.Why, for example, was the boycott of oil products against Haiti but not against Burma, where the elected president is under arrest, the parliament was exhausted and a part of its members have been imprisoned or even murdered?Why has not been imposed a boycott of oil products against Sudan, where there are still clashes with weapons - well known - pay with the money of the oil companies that work in the regions where refugees are located?The inconsistency of such a policy is truly scandalous.This morning the Commissioner Nielson illustrated us, once more, a positive example in relation to the Lomé Convention.If we apply the new Lomé convention without having first purified our policy from all its inconsistencies, the union policy will be built on the sand, to use a biblical expression.The advice did not get tired of reiterating, from time to time, the sectors in which things were not going well: agriculture, trade, prevention of conflicts, peace operations, fishing, emigration, the environment.Commissioner Nielson, what we are waiting for is an comprehensive relationship on the inconsistencies between our policies as well as some concrete proposals to remedy these inconsistencies, since otherwise it will happen again that all your beautiful examples, all your splendid policy - and I also say it to the secretary of state - will be built on the sand and will therefore not be able to resist for a long time.These are the citizens who ask us, and we have already claimed it since 1992: this is the true theme of today's discussion.I hope our message is well received and I sincerely hope that you will return here to undergo a relationship and concrete measures.Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, fully share the spirit of the intervention of the honorable Maij-Weegen and I believe that the representatives of the other institutions present here are all sincerely willing to deepen this theme such a spirit.It is a topic of fundamental importance for the European Union.To begin with, I would like to clarify well what we are discussing.Article 178, title XX of the consolidated version of the treaties on the Union reads as follows: ""In the implementation of policies that may have consequences for developing countries, the community takes into account the objectives referred to in article 177"".And what are these objectives that any policy of the European Union must take into account?"	it
Ireland supports the common point of view as well as many of the amendments to the European Parliament.A period of 25 years for the implementation of legal provisions is hardly acceptable.We have no problem with the enforcement of the pollutant principle to cover the costs for industrial, commercial and agricultural water use.Since life means life and access to clean drinking water is an elementary human right, I am firmly convinced that this guideline must enable free basic supply of private households with water, i.h.A certain contingent per household for water for drinking, cooking and sanitary purposes.Of course, we have to pay for waste and excessive consumption, and the cost recovery can be adjusted accordingly.In Ireland, where private households have not paid water fees since 1997 and therefore no more water meters are installed, you look at the introduction of water meters with great suspicion.The measurement of water consumption could be a very important instrument of water management as part of the new river area units and make a contribution to preventing water waste as well as the systematic planning of future needs.The purpose of the guideline is to promote the permanently environmentally friendly use of water in the EU.Water is a brief and valuable natural resource.It would be best for me if the application for change does not get through 45 tomorrow and the common point of view of Article 9 also applies to water fees.This would give the subsidiarity in the determination of water fees, and each Member State could set up their own system, provided the principles of this guideline in relation to incentives for permanently environmentally friendly and efficient water use remain comprehensively preserved.If change application does not fall 45 tomorrow, I have to bring in an oral amendment to ensure that the Member States have the opportunity to issue exceptional permits on the provisions of this article and thus enable the provision of a minimum amount to use in households before the cost recovery requires.All regulations must be enforceable and based on the general principle of political acceptance.I consider access to clean drinking water both in the developed and in developing countries for an elementary human right.Mr. President, commissioner, ladies and gentlemen!At the current state of pronunciation, I would like to highlight some aspects that I consider from the perspective of agronomy and because of my origin from a southern country in this guideline for extremely serious.For example, the topics of the costs and transfers.As for the costs, I would have liked to know exactly what costs we speak of.Are we talking about the distribution and origin of the resources?Are we talking about the quality of the distribution networks?Are we talking about the type of structural conditions required for care?Or are we talking about the large hydraulic buildings and memory pool?Laving the entire costs back to the agricultural sector would be barbaric.As for the transfers, they are defined as the transmission of surface water between the different territorial areas.Is the commissioner known that we have a transfer system in our country that is one of the oldest of Europe?These transfers already existed in very early epochs: they already existed in the times of the Romans, they were only less.	de
"Meanwhile, we have to pronounce a vote of trust from the Commission.""Far -heavy"".I don't want to go into the scope of this report here.I do not know whether he breaks the record of all the resolutions presented here, but definitely and without any doubt with this type of resolutions.I do not believe that there has been a decision in the past - and keep in mind that we develop complex resolutions in this parliament - in which paragraphs of more than 16 lines were contained without one point.He is also ""unclear"".I don't want to come back to what was said about the analysis of the questions that affect the parliament.This should be the subject of another report that we have to work out, and it is necessary to think about it, but not in this report.And in the end, frankly, Mr. President, I don't want to give any examples, but there are many in which the legal language is used with an alarming inaccuracy.Therefore - and I summarize - I expect - we are many who are waiting - their report, Commissioner Kinnock, to express us, because this is the task of Parliament.President!The scope and detail flood of the suggestions for necessary reform steps indicate the importance of such a reform.In view of the events that triggered these efforts, the need is also obvious.Hopes and expectations were all the more awakened by the strong announcements of the Commissioners Prodi and Kinnock in the plenary and in the budget control committee.The concept of transparency is particularly noticeable in the report.Ensuring this is a main concern.The importance of complete work can not be emphasized enough.But it is not just about a bureaucratic reform, but rather about the demonstration of good will towards the citizen.His trust in the EU policy must be recovered.The citizen raises the right to quick and open access to the institution and the readability of the regulations.He draws his understanding from it, and he wants a policy of success and at the same time sees this as a self -evident service in the responsible citizen.The success of the reform depends significantly on the commission's initiative.However, it irritates me when I hear today that the Commission now says that it only wants to discuss the interim report with the parliament.Her lecture, Mr. Kinnock, in the budget control committee next Tuesday, not only a one -way street can be, but we as a parliamentarian want and must help shape.And it also goes against my political understanding when a press conference takes place this week before we carefully discussed the template in the responsible budget control committee.I think Mr. Kinnock, despite all personal success: the Commission still has to do a lot to meet our legitimate high expectations.I can initially carry out for the protocol and as an explanation for Ms. Langenhagen that the decision that I will not speak in front of the whole parliament tomorrow and will therefore not be available for official inquiries about the report was not made by me or by the Commission - it was the decision of this parliament!"	de
First of all, I would like to thank the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development as well as its rapporteur, the President of the Commission, Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, for having examined the commission's proposal.The commission's proposal is, as some of you have pointed out, quite technical.However, the objective is quite simple: the harmonization of the procedures governing the authorization of additives in the food.At present today, there is a difference in processing of authorizations, which is a function of the moment when the requests were submitted, namely before or after January 1, 1988. The objective of the commission proposal is to harmonize these procedures in order to guarantee that such differences are no longer.The object of the proposed amendment is therefore very limited.Five amendments were presented by Parliament.I regret that the Commission is unable to adopt these amendments despite the fact that I am well aware of the opinions and the commitment of the Parliament, the Commission of Agriculture and, more particularly, of the rapporteur, Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, as for these problems.I intend to review each of the amendments separately.The first amendment proposes to modify the legal basis of the proposal by substituting article 152 for article 37. I simply wish to point out that the commission's proposal does not refer to health and consumer protection.The technical nature of the proposed amendment does not allow it to be interpreted as the primary objective of the protection of public health.I note that the legal and internal market commission also considers that article 37 constitutes the appropriate legal basis.I remind parliament that the primary objective of article 152 is the protection of health.I recommend that you read the arguments set out in the letter emanating from the Legal Commission, which describes the situation, in my opinion, with precision, clarity and with commendable conciseness.Amendments 2 and 3 go much further than the Commission's proposal, given that they tend to introduce additional provisions on genetically modified additives.I am the first to recognize that GMOs are a very important problem.I also recognize and concede that a certain number of initiatives are necessary in order to update the legislation of the EU in the field of GMOs.However, this technical amendment is not the right instrument for the introduction of such initiatives.The Commission is of the opinion that it is premature, at this stage, to amend the provisions currently established by Directive 70/524 concerning genetically modified additives.On the other hand, it is appropriate to wait for the developments relating to the common position on the amendment to Directive 90/220, which is currently second reading in Parliament.The Commission plans to go much further than what is currently proposed by Parliament in its amendments.I can also guarantee in Parliament that I will ensure that the relevant provisions of Directive 90/220 are included in the proposal to reshape the 70/524 directive that the commission proposed in the white paper concerning food security and which will be presented in Parliament before July 2001. I can also ensure the Parliament that all the remarks made today will hold our attention.Amendments 4 and 5 are also unacceptable because they grant an unjustified preference to copies of products by giving them the authorization to be put into circulation even before a request for authorization has been submitted.	fr
Therefore, as they can verify, it is a very important project and that really serves the states of the Union to be able to provide a more complete and more homogeneous judicial assistance instrument.Actually, in the Bosque of Council, there are still some divergences today regarding the type of agreement and some clauses provided for therein.Some of these divergences have already been solved, others still subsist.The spirit of the proposal, in any case, is to provide law professionals - the judges first, but also the affected citizens - of an effective operational instrument for the fight against crime, in respect, however, of the fundamental procedural guarantees and the general principles of the rights of the human being.This is the reason why, despite the numerous lagoons of the text, the provisions provided for in it can be accepted - they can be, Mr. President - but on condition that they are properly amended to guarantee the functionality for the other professionals of law and acceptability by citizens.For this reason, the Commission has presented several amendments, aimed at systematically rethinking the proposal of the council suggesting a series of technical adjustments to ensure that the text is more harmonious and coherent regarding the proposed modifications, amendments that can be summarized in a greater exaltation of the fundamental rights of defense and in different technical modifications necessary to make more understandable a whole series of dark and contradictory passages, as well as to suppressThat part that refers to remote telephone listeners, when still, on the one hand, a technical knowledge and, on the other, the acceptability by the governments of the different states of the Union.The proposal, as formulated by the Council, and subsequently modified by the Commission, provides for an agreement based on three titles: in the first indications are facilitated to uniform the procedures and procedures that must be followed in the Rogatory Commissions;In the second, a series of specific requests for judicial assistance is listed and the procedures and procedures that must be met in relation to these judicial assistance actions are established;In the third, finally, the forms according to which telephone listeners can be carried out to citizens who are in a state other than their origin are planned and established.Undoubtedly, Mr. President, international cooperation is necessary to face both cross -border crime and crime in the field of the State whose evidence is abroad.However, it is necessary that a new agreement be prepared as soon as possible that takes into account other problems, even more delicate: all the problems inherent in the double punishability and that inherent to the specialty, as well as the one referring to the credibility of a State of the Union with respect to the judicial authority of the other states of the Union.It is, therefore, extremely important issues that we hope that the Council will meet again as soon as possible to issue a new opinion.Mr. President, as regards many other points of the matter, I refer to the content of my written report.	es
To achieve the highest possible degree of success in achieving the objectives of these policies, it is necessary to coordinate them and organize them based on well -elaborate, intelligently elaborated guidelines, I would say.Let's not forget that these policies, when effective, are also visible to the European citizen, who benefit from them and confirms the immediate improvement of their quality of life.Let us not forget that special attention must be devoted to the furthest regions and the island regions of the European Union, because, because of its geographical situation, they face fundamental obstacles in their economic and social development;Not being, of course, that the Commission intends to build bridges and submarine tunnels to connect them with the European trunk.Finally, I would like to emphasize that structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility, so that they adapt to changing circumstances and that they respond in that way to the new challenges and opportunities that arise with the arrival of the new millennium, for which we all make the best votes.Mr. President, without a doubt, the report of Mrs. Schroedter includes enough important observations, and I congratulate her for it.I think, however, that we should show more concern about the orientation and results of the regional community policy.Broadly speaking, the huge mass strike not only does not attenuate, but also aggravates even more within the framework of structural policy.The agrarian economy and rural areas are irreparably affected by the regional policy that is exercised, with dramatic consequences for rural employment and for the living conditions of farmers, in the south mainly.Regional inequalities increase dramatically within the Member States.If we examine the data of the sixth report, we will verify that during the last decade huge deviations are recorded regarding the average regional development.Minimum, if not non -existent, is the attention that is given to the enormous problems of the insular regions of the Union, whose deficiencies in infrastructure, transport, communications and energy unfailingly lead to depopulation.All this is responsible for both regional and more general economic and social policy of the Union.Large sectors of the peoples of the Union strongly condemn this policy for dangerous and antipopular.The new guidelines are unfortunately move in the same sense and nothing suggests that it can change with the application of these guidelines.Mr. President, Avilies, allow me to say here some brief words to underline two points that these reports remind us and that have an essential strategic importance in the perspective we have of the Union.The first is the essential and fundamental importance that we continue to attribute to the principle of economic and social cohesion.And we manifest concern about the news that comes to us that the importance of that goal is declining in the mood of the commission.We continue to consider that economic and social cohesion is a fundamental objective of the Union.Secondly, I agree with the words here heard a deputy about the question of the islands and I also want to draw attention to ultraperiferic regions.We would like that in the future there would be more boldness in the treatment of the question of the ultraperiferic regions, such as, in the case of my country, the Azores and Madeira Islands.	es
"Signor President, excuse me, but a small translation error was made in the French cabin, about what has just said the honorable Alyssandrakis, on the most delicate word of the whole discussion.I would not like that misunderstandings could arise.The translation, in French, made the honorable Alyssandrakis say that the ""confederal"" solution is the best, while it is evident that he spoke of a ""federal"" solution.It is extremely important to specify it, Mr. President.Many thanks for the clarification, honorable Wurtz.Mr. President, Malta and Cyprus are very different from continental Europe countries.The Maltese in particular were very good at surviving in geographical and geopolitical conditions hostile.Their success has depended largely by their spirit of initiative, their dynamism and their flexibility.Malta has a very vital heavy and light industry, expanding financial services, good agriculture, flourishing tourism and an incredible variety of job opportunities, all on an island practically without natural resources.I am therefore sure that an island like that of Malta, with a population of 340 000 inhabitants, cannot adapt to the rigidity of the economic and legal structures of continental Europe which has a population thousands of times greater.When I look at the proposed tool, therefore, I do not see a measure capable of bringing two peoples to the womb of Mother Europe.The situation is more similar to a black hole in space, which sucks masses within itself with so much power that even light is not able to go out.We must not induce these island populations to collaborate in their own destruction, offering them money to convince them to accept laws that are as extraneous to their culture as a black hole for Mother Earth is.The European Union must leave Malta and Cyprus in peace.It seems to me that the only one wants this to Malta is the political class, and I cross the fingers hoping that once again the Maltese are the winners.Mr. President, this is one of the rare times when the positions adopted by all the components of the migly show the maximum convergence of opinions on the Cypriot question and on the pre -adhesion procedure for Cyprus and Malta.This means that in all of us there is a certain common consciousness about the so -called political problem of Cyprus.At the same time this implies a great advantage for the Council and the Commission to ensure that this potential, expressed by all parties and peoples of Europe, becomes the cornerstone of their political approach to the solution of the problem.Ladies colleagues, Helsinki represents a historical turning point and a new point of reference.It would be a tragic error if now, for any reason, we considered the balance achieved in Helsinki as a starting point for new negotiations or if with our attitude we threatened this balance.The times are mature: what is required of Commission and advice is a firm determination to give a following, without subterfugi, to the pre -adhesion negotiations with Cyprus and Malta - ultimately, the most ready candidate countries of all - so that their resolveness is a warning for any part that can have an idea different from what we all share."	it
"According to Oslo, a total of 17,400 hectares of land were expropriated by October 17, 1999, including 846.2 hectares under the new Barak government.Trees have been uprooted, other houses were destroyed, and in East Jerusalem, the use of water is restricted or it is denied, while the settlement activity continues and the number of settlements is constantly increasing.However, the election of the new government undoubtedly meant positive steps, at least the negotiations were resumed.In the Middle East, however, there will be no stable and permanent peace if the Palestinians do not have their own state and if they cannot move freely within their territorial area.The international community must simply meet the UN resolutions 332, 248, 245 and 194.We consider the suspension of relationships with Syria to be worrying, as well as Prime Minister Barak's decision to postpone the Israeli troop deduction and the implementation of the Agreement of Sharm El sheikh.In our opinion, the European Union must play a political role in the negotiations that corresponds to the economic aid it has achieved.We must not be content with an extras role, but have to appear as the main actors without getting into a conflict of interest with the United States, as Minister Gama said today.Mr President, I would like to thank Commission Member Patten for his current explanations, in particular for his report on the role of the European Union in Peace process and the assurance that this role is not only limited to that of the ""financier"" for the entire campaign.I was very disappointed when it became known this week that the peace talks between Israel and Syria were interrupted.I very much hope that a compromise will be found with regard to the existing problems, so that the peace talks can be resumed as soon as possible.Nevertheless, positive political developments in the Middle East have recently emerged.The fact that the Syrian Foreign Minister and the Israeli Prime Minister recently sat at the same table in their respective history at the talks in America shows that hatred and animosities, however old they may be, can be overcome.The responsible politicians have to raise a lot of courage to create a framework that can form the basis for a comprehensive peace solution in the Middle East.It is clear to me that even after an agreement between Syria and Israel, the Israeli Prime Minister will encounter strong resistance to any further agreement with Syria in future referendums.The settlers on the Golan heights will request compensation and security guarantees.If Syria were ready for concessions in the security question, the prospects for a successful solution to the problems between Israel and Syria would be good.As for the Palestinian question, there are still problems with the implementation of certain aspects of the WYE agreement.The key problems are currently the difficulties of troop deduction and returning areas.The fact that only a few Palestinian prisoners were released and the Israeli government obviously hesitates to stop the implementation of already placed building permits and to refuse to issue new permits.These problems clearly hinder the progress in negotiations on the final status, even if I do not believe that these conversations can be delayed endlessly."	de
"There are therefore two possible solutions: the guideline is not applicable in Denmark or the guideline is due to introduce Denmark to introduce generally binding contracts.Can the Commission reaffirm that the directive on the posting in Denmark is not applicable with regard to the ""collective agreement declared generally binding"" (see Article 3 paragraph 1), since there are no such generally binding contracts under Danish law?If not, I request information on how the guideline is to be applied on this point.The European Union's guideline on the posting of employees stipulates that the mandatory regulations in relation to the working and employment conditions in the recording country must also apply to employees who were sent to this country.According to this, two options are conceivable: either the legal provisions of the reception center or the collective agreements, which have been declared generally binding for a certain branch, apply.Because there is no system of the collective agreements declared generally binding in Denmark, the legal provisions for the implementation of the directive, in addition to the working conditions specified by the legislation, must also be provided that the generally binding and most representative organizations also apply to collective agreements that are sent.In short, Denmark has two options: either it introduces the corresponding legal provisions, or in turn it in turn selects a collective agreement in a legislative manner that is activated in a legal way.Talks are currently taking place between the European Commission and Denmark, and Denmark is expected to notify the implementation of this directive in national law.The deadline for answering the Commission's questions expired on December 6, 1999.We have no answer.We are now waiting and seeing the next steps.Thank you for the clear answer, which - if correctly interpreted - amounts to the fact that the guideline on the posting of employees imposes a system of general contracts to the Danish state.This is a clear answer, but I would like to point out that a politically very difficult situation arises for the Danish organizations, the Danish government and the Danish parliament.As is well known, there are fundamental differences between the Danish system, which is largely based on collective collective agreements, and the continental system that is based on legal provisions.The disagreements and the correspondence they address, Ms. Commissioner, primarily refer to another guideline, namely to the working time directive.Now a new deadline for deadline and a contractual procedure is to be expected, since the Danish government does not intend to adopt laws and enable generally binding collective agreements or have expressly pointed out that it does not want to do so.At least there is the intention to change the system applicable in Denmark or any other country.As I have explained beforehand, there are always difficulties with the interpretation of the European Commission's guidelines because they only set one frame and are very general, but also because the individual systems are designed very differently from country to country.The problem mentioned in your request does not only affect Denmark.A few questions are not only open there.Five countries have already implemented the implementation in national law, in the rest of the discussion process.It is therefore true - this is our goal, and therefore the consultations and the pronunciation between the Commission and the Danish, but also the other governments take place - to be able to use what was decided by all countries at European level and to be able to apply to the employees sent to Denmark from other countries."	de
It is about the affirmation of a European cultural policy with regard to which I expect from us, Parliament, Commission and Council, which we are in agreement.Who says cultural policy says in particular defense of the role of creation, recognition of authors and production of a demanding culture.Even more, today where Europe must have a new policy for the rights of authors and neighboring rights, it is urgent - it has just been highlighted several times - to define and redefine what an author is.We are still too vague in this regard and new technologies now impose this clarification effort to us.Mr. President, the Commissioner, the advent of the WEPI Treaty was remarkable progress to a global information company.The heritage of copyrights, which is old, crystallized in the treaties which represent a balanced and well thought out solution for copyright and neighboring rights, is crystallized.In addition to these recommendations, the entry into force of the treatments and final form will however depend on the respective application of the parties.In the United States, the OMPI Treaty has already entered into force by means of the Digital Millennium Corporate Act and this legislative measure made it possible to safeguard the delicate balance of the OMPI.The EU must also move forward in its legislative work in accordance with what has been agreed to the OMPI.It is therefore concerned that the positions of the previous parliament do not support the balanced organization of the OMPI.The first reading of the Copyright Directive was particularly aberrant and, moreover, we are changing the balance in a bad sense from a European point of view.The proposed recommendations will not improve the position of culture in Europe, quite the contrary.The modifications proposed by the Parliament would especially improve the possibilities of media companies, having a stable position on the markets, to transfer their old market share of more than 80 percent to a new environment using a rigid and excessive regulation of copyright.So I'm not talking about the recommendation of Ms. Charlotte Cederschiöld, which is an excellent document, but many themes related to copyright and which have been dealt with by the previous parliament.As an isolated remark, I would therefore like to thank Ms. Cederschiöld because she has clarified, for example, the concept of the said temporary copies in her opinion.In the OMPI Treaty, we did not consciously take a position on temporary copies.If these technical copies were part of the protection, data transmission - as it is clearly seen in the recommendation - would become without any expensive and complicated reason.It would be the same situation as if the factor had to pay copyright when it brings a book to the customer who will read it.The real advantage of culture is being able to transmit art and information, safely and without difficulty, directly from the artist to the user, to the consumer.The new framework of action is above all a huge possibility of creating and disseminating culture according to new methods.	fr
In addition, request can be placed directly between the responsible authorities, without the path to be necessary via central authorities.There are basically two types of provisions: those that justify an obligation to provide assistance, such as the provisions on telephone and video conferences, controlled deliveries and monitoring telecommunications;And those who do not justify such an obligation, but only have a legal framework, for example, the provisions on common investigations, hidden investigations and the transfer of procedural documents.The Commission particularly welcomes the admission of provisions that relate to new or modern investigation techniques.When combating the form of crime, they are efficient that can most likely benefit from the opening of the limits of the organized crime.It is only too easy to guide you from the need to improve the efficiency of criminal investigations.However, an aspect must not be forgotten in all measures in connection with criminal proceedings.I very much welcome that the report by Mr. Di Pietro, whom I for his excellent work, in addition to this in such a short time, tend to be the greatest respect, contains the right to defense as one main point.At the moment it is only due to the Member States to ensure that these rights are respected under the examination of the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.It remains to be seen whether this will change with the new European Charter of Fundamental Rights in which the work has just started.We have to admit that Article 18 clearly deals with a controversial decision.The article was carefully developed in the Council in very long discussions to ensure that secret service activities remain efficient and that criminal investigations are covered.As far as the criminal investigations in my responsibility concerns, I take the request to take this point into account by various members of the European Parliament to the Commission and the Council and to deal with it on a common legal basis for reference to the relevance of monitoring telecommunications as a possible evidence in court.The Commission is completely aware that the present design is neither perfect nor ideal.But we have to be realistic.The text is the result of a mixture of institutional structures that are intended for the Justitial Cooperation in Criminal Matters according to the Maastricht Treaty or that of Amsterdam.This is now up to us, and practice alone will show us in detail whether and where there are defects and what further steps will be taken in the future.It is quite clear to me that the further development of mutual trust and the mutual reliability between the legal systems of the Member States will make it easier to advance on the way we have before us.Apart from that, the European Council in Tampere has specified the direction to be recorded by the Commission.The necessary steps will be the realization of the principle of mutual recognition of judicial decisions and the euro justice project.The Commission sincerely hopes that its efforts to progress in these important areas will find the support of the European Parliament.	de
"It's a shame!This figure of 167 million euros for as many years, is a shame for the European Union!We are literally obliged to strip theatrical groups, young musicians, avant-garde activities in the field of arts and letters, we ridicule them and we accept a single project in the face of thirty other discussions, so that Europe is felt as a foreign, contrary, and adversary factor in any attempt at cultural accomplishment.The European Union must respond in this area, because the path we have chosen is not only that of the euro, or enlargement or that of geostrategic purposes.We must ensure that European unification also flourishes on a political level.It is a very sad situation.And as long as we continue to keep the unanimity system, and, as yesterday, the government of the Netherlands can impose these 167 million in a completely arbitrary way, and that, as tomorrow, Mr. Haider's government will tell us what our cultural activities will be, we will never be able to progress.For this reason, it is essential for the intergovernmental conference to make certain important decisions for the effort of the European Parliament to be released from the commitments of each government and can give a significant cultural impetus to the European space.Madam President, I fully share the opinions expressed by the rapporteur and also thank the president of the Culture Commission, Mr. Gargani, for laudable work shot in a substantially difficult mediation process.The requirement to simplify and strengthen the previous programs was made, of course, to feel, but we all wanted the culture program that could actually contribute to exalt, for example, the peculiarities of each cultural sector, even - and I would even say especially - less known sectors, or better, of these precisely.We hope that this will happen at least in the evaluation scale.We believe a lot in the validity of cultural actions, also in terms of contribution to the social and economic growth of a people.And Europe can rightly compete with the rest of the world by fully rediscovering its roots, highlighting the common cultural heritage, by valuing and recovering the cultural and linguistic islets so far little known.In the case of the great educational mission relating to the cultural dimension, a mission that the European Union must assume, one of the most obvious limits of the program lies in the quantification of financing - we have heard it on several occasions - which denounces an insufficient awareness - at least from the Council, not of the Commissioner - of the importance of the cultural operation.The document which puts the economic factor in a priority position in relation to social integration also testifies to this.With regard to the global growth of the European Union and the awareness of being European citizens, we believe that the ""Culture 2000"" program, within the limits of its funding, can contribute to this great common objective.Madam President, I join the unanimous movement tonight and declare to support the adoption of the 2000 Culture program. In addition, I also thank the rapporteur, Mr. Graça Moura, who took over from our former colleague, Nana Mouskouri."	fr
"However, after Cardiff and Luxembourg, an important merit of this summit is to show the political will to promote stronger social cohesion, in particular in favor of the 57 million who live in Europe, such as single mothers, large families and children, to which further socially excluded, namely those who will have no access to the new areas of knowledge, which will lead to new social inaccessions.A decidedly future-oriented economic and social policy is therefore required, so that no ditch between ""info-rich"" and ""info-arm"", that is, as one of my colleagues said earlier, no digital gap is created.For this reason, in my opinion, the new technologies will only assume strong integration impulses for our growth if they are learned from childhood, because by 2010 half of the jobs will belong to sectors that are directly related to information technologies.For this I recommend that three decisions are made on the Lisbon summit: first, a strategy of lifelong learning and the definition of an agenda to remove both the economic and intellectual poverty of children;second, design of European society with regard to the European research area;Third, determination of an open coordination procedure associated with our social and economic policies, supplemented by a coordinated procedure in the evaluation of the national action plans.President!My dear ladies and gentlemen!There is an idea in the explanation of the Portuguese Council Presidency, which I like extremely.This one idea is the idea that the strength of our European economy is in performance, imagination and creativity, simply in the knowledge of people in the European economic process.However, if we take this seriously, if the really political program is to be, a policy of social inclusion no longer requires any further justification because social participation as such would be the strongest productivity of our common economy.If so, Mr. Council President, we need common goals.We need fixed goals that we make measurable - in qualitative as in the quantitative sense - about increasing the employment rates, as has now also been proposed by the Commission.We need fixed, mutually agreed goals about the reduction of the unemployment rate - as has now also been proposed by the Commission - to 4 % in 2010. It must be concluded with the logic that the Ecofin Minister is celebrated at home for consolidation success, but the responsibility for the question of huge unemployment in Europe is in the fog.I wish you a lot of strength, the support of Parliament and the commitment to the fact that this parliament has more to say in the questions of economic and employment policy in the future, as is expected by the citizens in Europe.Then they would have another ally for their politics.President, Mr. Council President, Mr Commission!It is gratifying and promising when this plenary - as was the case here - is talking about the new strategic goal for the coming decade: to make the European Union most dynamic and competitive economic and social space in the world by being able to use new technologies, innovation and knowledge so that we are able to do the level of economic growth with more and better workplaces and larger social workplacesto increase."	de
"The Presidency mentions the delicate issue of Corporation Tax and points out that, indeed, there is great stagnation in that issue in the Monti package.I would like to defend that a deep analysis of the evolutions in the scope of the Corporation Tax is done, especially also in the Commission.I would also like to suggest the Member States to take into consideration begin a process of Luxembourg in this matter because when reading the report, I see above all examples of ""best practices"" that could be addressed.Therefore, I ask that attention to this point is also paid.Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. President of the Commission, many things have already been said and, therefore, if the risk of repeating itself is intervened.However, I wanted to thank the Portuguese presidency for the document presented and the convincing speech delivered by the President of the Council.True, as the President Mr. Guterres has recalled - that in Lisbon it is not planned to launch new initiatives, but to converge those of Luxembourg, Cardiff and Colonia.It is the first time, however, after many years, that a strategic objective is proposed and I think this is extraordinarily important: to turn the union into an economic space based on innovation and knowledge to increase economic growth and to achieve full quality employment and social cohesion.Last year the Commission elaborated a study from which it was deduced that, in the case of not intervening deeply in qualification and professional training, in 2010, 80% of current employees will have obsolete professionalism, which will exacerbate existing inequalities and produce new inequalities: therefore, continuous training and mass investments in knowledge and knowledge.Also with regard to investigation, another strategic sector, it is necessary to promote it in the Member States, in Europe;It is necessary to make a quality leap, move from the framework programs to a European research space, to a common research policy.And of innovation: not only structural and technological, but also in procedures and methods.As Mrs. van Lancker said, the Social Affairs Council must have the same importance as the Ecofin Council.Reinforcement, therefore, of social dialogue as a fundamental instrument of consensus to make the necessary changes.Lisbon must be remembered not only by the excellent preparatory document, but as a summit that will mark a significant turn for growth, employment and social cohesion in Europe.Mr. President of the Council, I would like to congratulate him for having put Europe according to the idea that the modernization of the economy and social cohesion are compatible concepts.The preparation of the Lisbon summit comes to highlight that in Europe you do not work enough, and that, if we want to be the most dynamic region in the world, we have not only to work more, but also with more information and ability to use it."	es
At the same time they ask for the existence of an independent European agency that coordinates and controls the regularity of the OLAF's investigations, without prejudice to the administration of justice of each of the Member States and with supervision of the Court of Communities.Finally, in line with what was agreed in Tampere, the report reaffirms the figure of the European Prosecutor's Office, which in good time went on stage by decision of the Commissioner António Vitorino, and asks the CIG to include in its order the creation of that new figure, considered today indispensable by all.For reaffirming the need for legal disciplinary and effectively, the life of the institutions, closing the financial system of the Union with a European material and procedural right appropriate to the credibility of community economic life, this report deserves our approval.Now, some very simple questions are raised.Will there be sufficient legal basis today to legally justify the creation of a new specifically community criminal law that, although it can be considered subsidiary, will always compete in practice and in certain sectors to the traditional and parcel criminal law of the Member States?Wouldn't it be politically more correct, in case of doubt, include the reform of the Judicial System in the order of the CIG day, introducing those proposals in the most general reform of the Judicial System of the Union, in the image and likeness of what is requested for the European Prosecutor's Office?Wouldn't these measures of the greatest interest be for a review of the treaties that contribute to the strength of the space of freedom, security and justice of the Union?Mr. President, the EU is being subject to rigorous controls.Confidence in the Union is seriously damaged.To remedy this situation, action is needed.That is why we welcome the increase in resources for the OLAF, which will allow a more effective investigation of all doubts.We also believe that it is obvious that those who commit crimes against the EU respond to justice.It is unfortunate that the Convention on Protection of the Financial Interests of the Union is applied in so few member states.For this reason, we believe that it is logical that the presentation of proposals that imply an existing judicial framework is responsible for union.Instead, I am not convinced that this kind of improvement requires common European norms or centralization of the fight against crime.At present, the idea of ​​a European prosecutor produces skepticism, is something that seems impracticable within the framework of current treaties.We believe more in Eurojust, where national prosecutors collaborate.The big problem is not the adoption of legal measures to combat crimes, but they are committed so much regularly and are discovered so often.The challenge for the commission and for us is, however, find balance.Scams and irregularities should not chain a hierarchical bureaucracy, which through exaggerated controls prevents the development of modern administration.	es
This is the correction to be imposed on the action of the Commission.Mrs. President, Lords, in the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and freedom and sovereignty of peoples, against any new or old fascism, Nazism or communism, and taking into account that all previous speakers have spoken of sovereignty of the Austrian people, we verify that today it is precisely this Parliament that denies said sovereignty.From the reading of the Austrian Liberal Party program, elements that justify the accusations of attack on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights, fundamental freedoms and the rule of law, contemplated in article 6 of the Treaty are not extracted.On the other hand, I would like to get the attention of their lordships about the fact that recently the president in the exercise of the Council, so critical of Austria, has given the inhabitants of Macao the sovereignty of the democratic Republic of Popular China.But today, to reinforce the democracy of the Union, it is appropriate to isolate Austria, criminalize a democratically chosen party by Austrian citizens and allow the entry into Europe of the Turkey of the Gray Wolves.Mrs. President, Ladies and Lords Deputies, we are discussing a matter of extreme gravity.Nothing more and nothing less than the presence in a government of a Member State of a political force whose doctrine and whose principles are incompatible with the conceptual and moral bases that inspire the union and that are enshrined in their constitutive treaties.A simple reading of article 1 of chapter 4 of the political program of the Austrian Liberal Party shuds any democratic consciousness.The assumption of ethnicity as a defining factor of a nation and the affirmation of the superiority of an ethnicity over the others, as it is written here, resurrects old spectra of a century that we have just left behind and that some historians have defined as the century of horrors, horrors that the unacceptable philosophy of Mr. Haider's political program again agitates before our stunned eyes.Of course, the Austrian people are sovereign and of course we must respect the principle of non -interference in the internal affairs of a Member State.But the problem is not that.The problem is whether the Union can remain indifferent to the formation of a government in a Member State that includes a party of such characteristics.Our answer to this crucial question is no.Beyond strategic or tactical considerations, beyond possible exculpations extracted from otherwise behaviors, and above the interest of the party or electoral situation, the Spanish delegation of the popular group of this Parliament, in full tune with the Spanish Popular Party and with the Government of Spain, expresses with roundness its full coincidence with the declaration of the Portuguese Presidency of the Council on January 31With its tone and with its reach.(Applause) Konrad Adenauer said on one occasion - and he knew what he said - that the safest way to appease a tiger is to allow you to devour you.History is the compendium of those things that could have been avoided.	es
We will not fail to focus all our attention on this problem because all the credibility of the authorities and the representative structures of the Albanians in the field also depends on their ability to prove that they are capable of applying measures guaranteeing the multiethnic nature of the territory.I would like to thank Mr. President in office.I have in mind - like all of us, I think - that Portugal, his former president Mr. Soares and his government observed a circumspect and moderate attitude during bombings in the Balkans.Today's political declaration on this issue is very positive, I emphasize and congratulate myself.Despite everything, a concern arises, because if, on the side of the European Union, the intentions are good and sincere, the results are very thin.Unfortunately, lately, we have been witnessing the disappearance of all the minorities - Serbs, Roma, Turks, Croats, - Kosovo and we wonder what will happen.We note the failure of the United Nations mission and Mr. Kouchner in Kosovo.Because it is a failure that after a whole war waged to avoid an ethnic purification, there is a purification due to the other edge.This is why I repeat my question: does the Council intend to take more concrete initiatives to tackle these questions with Mr. Kouchner, on a very large part responsible for the situation that prevails today in Kosovo.Mr. Alavanos, I cannot agree with what you have just said, with your last sentence concerning the responsibilities of Mr. Kouchner and I would like to make a very important distinction: the structure installed in Kosovo is a structure under the supervision of the United Nations.The European Union gave it all the possible support and the countries of the European Union, as such, contributed to it in different ways.But it cannot be denied that Mr. Kouchner's efforts in order to normalize the inner situation of Kosovo are extremely positive.Regardless of the fact that you can estimate and that we too estimate that certain results of these efforts, for reasons which exceed Mr. Kouchner, could not be as effective as we would all wish it.It is necessary to make a distinction, on the one hand, between the question of the responsibility of the European Union and, in particular in this case, the possible action of the Council in this context and, on the other hand, the responsibility of the international community as such, which has the general supervision on the situation in Kosovo.The responsibility of the European Union is therefore part of a determined context.It is towards the international community as such, in particular the United Nations, that it is necessary to turn to the responsibilities of implementing resolution 12/99 and in particular as to the logic underlying this resolution and the compatibility of this resolution with reality.These are questions that we must ask ourselves, but it is within the framework of the United Nations that we must ask ourselves these questions.	fr
His honor has referred to the issue of Ethiopia, which is part of the scope of national indicative programs, but there is, as his honor knows, various community actions to fight AIDS and, in that regard, his honor is right, probably the United States is not doing better.For the rest, in terms of development aid policy I consider that Europe rigorously has anything to worry about the simple reason that our behavior in this regard has no comparison with that of the United States.The question of his honor has derived towards the problem of the armaments, of a broader political nature, which does not seem to me that he fits in the scope of this question, but that in the future the Council will naturally face it if it considers it appropriate, and decides to raise it in a specific framework.Is the advice of the social problems that causes food export to developing countries below the EU production costs?Does the country plan in the exercise of the Presidency to intervene in this matter?Since its author is not present, question No. 13 decays.I thank Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, in whose person I personally welcome the Presidency of the Portuguese Government.Let me point out what eloquent is and what versed is in European issues.However, in my case it has not given the answer that I would consider satisfactory.If the Council recognizes the great importance of culture as an economic good, in my opinion I should also demonstrate it in practice.And I fear that the justification that the cultural sector is conditioned by the principle of subsidiarity and that, therefore, it is the responsibility of national governments is an apparent justification.Because the question that I had raised and that has been unanswered was why when the European Parliament requests an increase in the funds for the financing of the cultural programs of the European Union, the Council, as well as the Commission, as a general rule they cut them, sometimes even even cancel them.This, in practice, shows its indifference towards culture, despite the promises of the Council about the great importance that is supposed to give it.Thus, I would like to ask the advice if you are willing to support culture there with the same complacency with which the banana, hops, cows or hemp of India finances.We do not have, honor, an economic conception of our management of the Portuguese presidency and, therefore, the cultural dimension, as it will understand, is at the center of our concerns.But these cultural dimensions almost always have an economic dimension, in turn, that is, the set of resources susceptible to mobilization precisely for support for cultural actions.And that is a dimension that is difficult to overcome in the field of the European Union and, in particular, in the scope of the Council.For our part, we will try to strengthen and consolidate the European position regarding cultural goods and services and activities in that sphere, because we think this is one of the elements of the essential identity of the image of the union itself and its own specific identity.	es
You may be aware that this hospital is located in the northern part of the city and that, in view of the tense existing situation, Albankosovares cannot access the hospital under any circumstances.What does the commission do to ensure that Albanokosovares have access to the hospital?Regarding the first question, I will travel personally to Kosovo at the beginning of next month to make another visit and I will undoubtedly examine the allegations that his lordship has made about Echo's food package.I had not heard anything about that indication before, but it is an important observation and I will not stop investigating it when it is there.Secondly, I perfectly understand what your honor says about Mitrovica.I was in Mitrovica a couple of months ago and I could see for myself what the situation was.He had conversations with the municipal leaders of both communities, including the leader of the Albana party, which in the past had exercised as a doctor and won everyone's recognition for their medical assistance during and after hostilities.Therefore, I know the serious problem that exists in that hospital and I can assure your honor that we will not spare efforts to ensure that everyone in Kosovo has access to adequate health care, regardless of the ethnic group to which it belongs.The specific difficulties that exist in Mitrovica - for example, is not only a matter that Albanian patients have difficulty accessing the hospital, but that Albanian staff have had difficulty working there - represent a especially serious problem.We will try to find solutions, but it is not easy.Question No. 37 Formulated by (H-0029/00): Subject: The blockade maintained by Turkey against Armenia taking into account that the European Union actively promotes social, economic and political relations with Armenia under the collaboration and cooperation agreement signed on October 12, 1999, what measures is proposed to adopt the commission to persuade the Turkish government of the need to raise the economic block that maintains against Armenia?The Commission supports all efforts to find a solution to the conflicts between Türkiye and Armenia and regrets that a normalization of relations between the two countries has not yet been achieved.In the current political circumstances, it is, however, unrealistic imagining that the border between Armenia and Türkiye, as well as that between Armenia and Azerbaijan, can be opened without having previously reached a solution to the Nagorni Karabaj conflict.Mr. President, the Commission also negotiates with the view set on the future, in view of the incorporation of Türkiye into the European Union.Is the commission to impose the previous lifting of the blockade as a condition for the start of the conversations, given that we are all neighbors and we also want to cultivate positive neighborhood relations within the European Union?My question is, therefore, the following: Is the commission proposed imposing this as one of the conditions to improve the result of future deliberations?The fundamental issue is the support for the efforts of the Minsk Group of the OSCE aimed at finding a solution to the Nagorni Karabaj conflict, and we are willing to help in everything we can.	es
I want to approach another fundamental democratic question without eyeshadow.As a member of the Assembly who has just started his work on the Charter of fundamental rights, I mean in complete clarity that, for my group and I, a solemn proclamation of the Charter is not enough.What would the citizens say if they are solemn rights but that they cannot assert them individually?No, I think that would only more like the credibility crisis from which the Union suffers.For all of us, low participation in the European elections should be a sufficient alarm signal.What we need are perceptible rights by all, the charter of fundamental rights must take on a legally binding character for all those who live in the Union, for all citizens.In the interest of the latter, we should work in concert at this objective and I expect from the intergovernmental conference that it reviews the Cologne decision in the matter at the end of the year.Naturally, there is also talk of the effectiveness of decisions and the functioning of institutions in a union expanded to 27 members and more.We will not succeed by a mini-reform such as that envisaged by the Council and that is why it would be necessary to submit all the institutions to the test bench.We must undertake courageous changes while attaching the greatest attention to the balance between large and small member states.I particularly insist as a representative of a large Member State.I thank the commission for the proposals it has advanced and I am convinced that there will be, within this Parliament also, in -depth discussions with the citizens on all the questions they will have raised.I would still like to tackle a last question.The opinion of the Parliament expressly claims changes to the treaty in the field of economic policy.Indeed, economic globalization and above all the introduction of the euro and the supporting stability pact make it necessary to probe the decision -making processes.But that's not all.It is above all necessary to have the courage to carry out a critical examination of the policies carried out so far by the Union.It is a Europe full of social justice.A Europe full of social justice remains more than ever because it is above all a question of placing the fight against mass unemployment and poverty at the center of the policy of the Union.To do this, it is also necessary to have the courage, in my opinion, to modify article 4 of the treaty which defines the Union, in the classic line of neoliberalism, as an open market economy where competition is free as well as article 105 of the CE Treaty, because the European Central Bank must finally respect the mission assigned by the Treaty and which consists in promoting, by its monetary policy, sustainable growth and employment.Mr. President, the Europe of Nations Group considers that the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference, as defined by the Helsinki Council, that is to say strictly centered on issues of decision-making in an enlarged Europe, must be respected.	fr
I wish to praise his thesis of a greater synergy between the institutions, not only between the commission and the parliament, but also between these and the Council, to underline the scope of the political challenge.A larger dialogue is needed, not only among us, but also with civil society.It should be explained more than Europe, we must know how to face fears and anxieties, because in many cases, the greatest fear is precisely fear in itself.Perhaps by promoting dialogue and information we will be able to overcome part of this problem.My group is particularly attracted by the creative possibilities that you have proposed in relation to the white photographer on the theme of the new forms of government that will be presented in the spring.In the face of this Europe as an interconnection of different plans that you have described it is very important that Europe focuses on its fundamental activities, it is important, that is, having the courage to suggest that there are fields in which Europe could perhaps be aside.A similar attitude could convince citizens that Europe, in its forms of government, is not directed exclusively by Brussels, which concentrates and phagocyte more and more powers, decisions and authorities.Here is the political essence of the challenge and it seems to me that today she has well illustrated to this assembly.For my group, the expansion is the first priority on which all the other possibilities of reform must be measured, that they concern the forms of government, the intergovernmental conference or the reform of the institutions.We see the expansion as a partnership process, not as a process that concerns only us and them;The expansion, for us, is an overall gain both for the Member States and for the candidate countries.Allow me to suggest to the Commission, which is the custodian of an extraordinary number of detailed information on the expansion, to present a document that illustrates the value of the expansion, not only in financial and budget terms, but in a broad sense: a document similar to the Cecchini report before the single act, which explains to the citizens, in order to involve them in the debate, that this is the great historical challenge that awaits modern Europe.We must be able to prepare the ground very carefully.Regarding Sudorientale Europe, they agree with you that the value of political institutions is measured on the basis of the results they achieve.During the legislature of the current commission in office and of this parliament we must be able to achieve peace in southeastern Europe, however arduous and complex.We applaud the stabilization and association agreements, but we would also like something more.We will make this material public and present it in the discussion on the SwoBoda report during the week.The strategic document places the emphasis on the global role of the European Union: our central objective must be to attribute to the union, on the global scenario, a weight that is proportional to its weight in terms of aid, commercial and financial flows.At the beginning of this decade we must foresee how our institutions will develop internationally before the end of these ten years, and in particular our role within international monetary bodies, within the United Nations agencies and so on.It is a debate that we must launch.To conclude, this morning, the next day Valentine's Day, the newspapers write that our honeymoon is over.	it
"I refer to the very serious accusations made against people and against parties such as mine, of long democratic tradition and scrupulous respect and defense of human rights shown for many years.Lady president, I am concerned with this defense of human rights to the other hand of human rights by the honorable Knörr does not prevent his party - to the government in that region - to count on the parliamentary support of a political group that not only does not condemn, but even encourages violence against citizens and ownership.I found that the honorable Gorostiaga AtxalandaBaso asks for the word on the same theme.It is not the right time to open a debate.I will give the floor for all the motions of procedure at the end of the voting.Report (A5-0029/2000) of the Honorable Brok on behalf of the Commission for Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, on the proposal for the Council Regulations concerning the realization of interventions in the framework of a pre -adhesion strategy for Cyprus and Malta (com (1999) 535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199 (CNS)) regarding the amendments.22 and 24 in other words, the speaker proposes an oral amendment aimed at inserting a considering that he would recite: ""Considering that Malta and Cyprus will participate ..."".(Parliament manifests its consent regarding the oral amendment) (the Parliament approves the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0013/2000) of the honorable Knörr Boràs on behalf of the Commission for economic and monetary problems, on the proposal of regulation of the Council that modifies the regulation (EC) n.3605/93 relating to the application of the protocol on the procedure of excessive deficits, attached to the Treaty that establishes the European Community (com (1999) 444 - C50174/1999 - 1999/0196 (CNS)) (the Parliament approves the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0020/2000) of the Honorable Cederschiöld in the name of the Commission for the freedoms and the rights of citizens,The internal affairs, on the project of the framework decision of the Council relating to the strengthening of the protection by means of criminal sanctions against the falsification of coins in relation to the introduction of the euro (5116/1999 - C50332/1999 - 1999/0821 (CNS)) (the Parliament approves the legislative resolution) Report (A5-0019/2000) of the Honorable of Pietro in the name of the Commission for the freedoms and the rightsCitizens, justice and internal affairs, on the project of the Council that establishes the agreement relating to judicial assistance in criminal matters between the Member States of the European Union (9636/1999 - C50091/1999 as well as SN 5060/1999 - C5-0331/1999 - 1999/0809 (CNS) before the vote Mrs. President, I want to first denounce the absence of the presidency of theof the Council.When dealing with these themes of the third pillar and conventions so important for the construction of a space of freedom, security and justice is not a good thing that is missing the presidency in charge of the Council.In addition, lady president, I have observations to be made on the problem of translations.I will give you only one example, because we don't have much time, but it is a coincidence in which the translations are truly important, being very precise legal concepts.In amendment no.83, in Italian, which is the original language, we read that ""the minor must be assisted by a person of his confidence or by an external expert or legal""."	it
"This is therefore at least one step forward.The second criticism that we formulate is that the system was too restrictive vis-à-vis the commission.We adopt legislation in the European Union.We expect the commission that it applies them.And from that moment, a system intervenes to hinder the commission and make its work more difficult - in particular, that was the case of the so -called ""counter -filet"" system, thanks to which the Council could block the Commission through a simple majority, even if the council was unable to find an alternative to the execution measure concerned.In this area also, we are progressing at least somewhat.The Council will no longer be able to block execution measures indefinitely beyond the three-month period, unless a qualified majority has been reached to block the measure, in other words, unless there is substantial opposition among the Member States within the Council.It is a more reasonable system.This is also a step forward.However, with regard to the other two criticisms, we are less satisfied.The first criticism relates to the system by which the Commission is monitored, examined, controlled if you want, by a single committee appointed by the Member States or the Council and not by Parliament.The legislative authorities, namely the Council and the Parliament, should be equal.We confer executive powers to the Commission but only an body appointed by the Council or the Member States can put the off, say no to the Commission and put an end to an execution measure.Parliament does not have equivalent power.It is true that we now see ourselves granting the sketch of such power in this new system.We are supposed to receive all the projects of execution measures sent to a commission at the same time that they are sent to this commission.We will have the opportunity to examine it, debate it and ask questions.However, we will only have the right to challenge the Commission if we believe that it exceeds the powers that we have given it in the legislation.In other words, we can contest the measure in case it exceeds skills but for its content.And in a democracy, parliament should be able to contest the content.I’m not saying that we’re doing so every week.We are not trying to immerse ourselves in execution decisions but the fact that we should have the opportunity to do so the rare times that it is necessary constitutes a democratic safeguard.This is what is missing in this system or, at least, which is only present in an embryonic form.Finally, our fourth criticism is as follows: if an execution measure is blocked through the comitology system, it is returned, not to the two branches of the legislative authority but only towards the council which has the right to take, possibly, an alternative measure.It is not correct.The two branches - Council and Parliament - adopt the legislation which gives execution powers to the Commission.If such execution measures are returned, they should be to both branches and not to one.In general, we have a system that has improved somewhat.The additional aspects arising from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but that could not change the basic decision of the Council."	fr
"The Commission must therefore take on its responsibilities regarding the creation of the strategic framework for the promotion of the capacity for professional insertion and the quality of the work, regarding the evaluation of the results and the effective dissemination of the best practices.Only in this way can the desired multiplier effect be obtained.Mr. President, I would like to intervene on the proposals of the Executive Commission relating to the budget line for information on the PAC.On October 26, 1999, the Commission adopted a proposal to guarantee the legal basis for the budget line relating to the raising awareness of public opinion on Community agricultural policy.Pursuant to this proposal, the current budget line B2-5122 will be abolished in favor of a new item B1-382.The actions that promote understanding between young farmers and the European Union are important, also creating stronger ties with candidate countries and the rest of the world.Therefore I present some amendments to Parliament to support this type of program.Since it is necessary to encourage young farmers to remain in agriculture, it is essential that they are well informed about the developments of common agricultural policy: the information and training of young farmers at European level is fundamental.I ask you to accept that a part of the available budget is intended for the development of knowledge among young European farmers.With regard to information and training, in the past, the budget line was intended for information, communication and training.The executive commission now proposes to exclude training.I believe that training should be included where it involves relevant information on the PAC at European level.European training is an element that serves to guarantee young farmers the necessary knowledge of the PAC to be able to adopt valid decisions regarding their future activities.Therefore I presented three amendments that I ask the Parliament to approve.Mr. President, I take the floor to express, on the basis of the experience gained in a municipal administration, the opportunity, but I would almost dare to say the need, that the projects of the Urban program are oriented in a triple direction: first of all, to encourage the recovery of infrastructure and historical neighborhoods, old and perhaps degraded.Secondly, facilitate and stimulate economic activities and social life within these historic centers, within these corners of ""old city"".What are those streets for, today perhaps illuminated with taste, with redone sidewalks, complete with tile pavement, splendid in their nore, if we are not able to fill them with activities and therefore employment?And I want to clarify that here it is not a question of financing or assisting different social categories, but rather of knowing how to discern the employment vocation in the projects to be selected, or, but it is the same thing, to select projects that manage to encourage the creation of work and the initiatives on the subject, to confer them more momentum.Thirdly, but perhaps I should have said first, the projects must be aimed mainly at the total recovery of people and families, because man does not exist to serve the right, but it is the right that exists to serve man."	it
"The Pes will never be nothing more than the comparison of the national interests that have already taken hold of the system: how can we not see that it is the union between London and Berlin supported by the respective complicit and that they do not conceive their diplomacy in terms of autonomy from Washington, carving out the role of extras.On the other hand, high representative Solana, she is a living example of this connivance, so to speak structural: she has gone from NATO to Pes without discontinuity, as if it were the same thing, and in reality it is.It is always a question of serving the empire.I cannot deny some fun in hearing it to invoke this delicious and at the same time persuasive argument in the ridiculous competition that opposes it to Commissioner Patten.In any case, she told a German journalist: ""The Americans call me"".High representative Solana, he could have added: ""It is to me that the orders pass"", because this is our observation.In the Balkans and elsewhere, the Americans one day ask us to destroy and then ask us to reconstruct.Honorable Martinez was fully reasoned to interrupt it, honorable Cohn-Bendit, it is still servility.You think I am excessive!Not a day passes that the reality of the facts does not provide us with additional evidence of our subjection.Echelon is one of the many examples and offers an image of Europe that is very different from what we like to paint here.Experts speak of a cultural problem, personally I find them very funny.On behalf of the coordination of the European rights, I have to tell them, Mr. High Representative for common foreign policy and security, which she does not enjoy our trust.He says he is against war, but as NATO Secretary General has triggered one.It was an offensive war, in the servile respect of American politics in an area that does not fall within the Treaty of the North Atlantic, against a state that had never been part of it, that did not constitute any threat to international borders, a war caused in violation of international law that establishes the principle of non -interference and the rules that governing the declaration of war.Today even the honorable Cohn-Bendit finds himself evaluating the results of the disastrous policy that he himself supported.We too have some questions to ask that they betray our concern, to use euphemism.First, she claims that common foreign and security policy aims to safeguard the security of the Member States of the Union.How can we believe it?Or perhaps you recognize these states the right to intervene in every part of the world?Secondly, in the latter hypothesis, which rules of international law and political morality do you refer to?I already imagine his answer: humanitarian law.In Kosovo we have systematically destroyed all Serbian civil infrastructures in the name of humanitarian law.When the US cause the death of 2,000 people in Panama, it was certainly not to impose their policy, it was to fight drug trafficking."	it
"So, on behalf of my group, I express a favorable opinion on the Theato report;However, I believe that it is basically a topic to be enrolled on the agenda of the cig.Mr. President, the report of the honorable Theato on the protection of the financial interests of the European Union, proposes in particular and at first, to centralize criminal actions through a European prosecutor.This proposal is decidedly contrary to the spirit of the current system in which criminal law and criminal procedure, which are the pivot of national legal systems, must depend on the sovereignty of each people and are the exclusive competence of each state.The idea of ​​a European prosecutor aims instead, as regards this matter, to relegate states in a subordinate role.In addition, this proposal would take a series of absolutely unpredictable reforms.In fact, according to the report of the honorable Theato, the European prosecutor would be necessary, in particular, to frame the investigations of the office for the anti -theft struggle, the Olaf.But at the same time we discover that according to the report Van Hulten the European prosecutor should in turn be supervised by a Court of the European Union.Here's how a small European reform can conceal a medium -sized reform that can in turn conceal a larger one.Without forgetting that a great reform can in turn conceal a giant because we will soon be proposed a European criminal law and therefore, why not, subsequently, also a minister of European justice, controlled by the European Parliament by extending its powers.Therefore, I believe that it is necessary to reflect well on the balance of the powers that you risk upsetting, presenting this type of apparently specific reform.In conclusion, it seems to us that proposals like that of a European prosecutor demonstrate the inability to imagine a Europe that is not only verticistic, centralized and organized around a super-state.The group ""Union for Europe of the Nations"" instead wants a polycentric Europe that associates nations as a network.Network that could reveal itself, for example, with a better coordination among the national prosecutors, with the creation, possibly, of national bodies specialized in infringements to the detriment of community finances.Mr President, the legal framework already exists, is based on a good principle and it is just necessary to improve it.Mr. President, Mr Theato offers us an institutional revolution for a double reason.Public opinion, which would be indifferent to twenty million unemployed and thousands of crazy cows, would instead be worried about the fraud that would endanger financial interests and these two reasons would justify a double device: a European criminal code that contemplates anti -communitarian crimes and a European general prosecutor.Mr Theato seems to have forgotten a European prison since the FBI, the European police, already exists with Olaf.Everything would be sanctioned in two regulations, one for the prosecutor and one for the criminal code, regulations based on article 280 of the Treaty, that is, starting from the derivative law because the characteristic of the derivative law is to allow any deviation.In reality, the deviations would be two."	it
"We think that, precisely because Turkey has entered into a new route of relation to the European Union and also because of the circumstance that the need to respond to the positions of the European Union in the field of foreign policy and common security, we will be tested, we will not be able to hide it - it is not worth hiding it - it is worth hiding - its will with respect to the priorities of the European Union in its external relationship.And naturally that the relationship with Armenia, from which the agreement established last year was proven, is an element of that external relationship.And we think that, if Turkey wants to advance, in the sense of sharing the fundamental values ​​of the European Union and the general framework of the European Union Relationship -and regardless of the bilateral idiosyncrasy that may have before another country -must behave in general terms in accordance with the basic orientations that the European Union reflects in its external relationship.For the rest, we are sure that this issue will appear among the priorities of the bilateral relationship between the European and Türkiye Union in the near future.Because they are similar issues, questions 5 and 6 will be answered jointly.Question No. 5 Formulated by (H-0031/00): Subject: Aggravation of the situation in Kosovo the genocide of the Serbs and the other ethnic minorities, except the Albanian, continues and aggravates in Kosovo.Even Mr. Kouchner himself has recently stated that ""the political situation and security in the area are absolutely unsatisfactory.""It is also denounced that Resolution 1244 of the NU has not been respected, since, on the one hand, the NU dispositions on the granting of guarantees are violated to all the inhabitants of Kosovo, and, on the other, the extremist and separatist forces charge strength, to the point of coming to appoint ""provisional prime minister"" of Kosov""Kosovo Protection Corps"".What actions plan to undertake the Council, in view of the facts, so that the resolutions of the NU are applied, especially resolution 1244, and to avoid secession of the province of Kosovo de Serbia?Question Nº 6 Asked by (H-0122/00): Subject: Ethnic cleaning of Serbs in Kosovo since the end of the bombing that NATO and the EU executed against Yugoslavia under the argument of preventing ethnic cleanand 768 killed, reproducing an ethnic cleaning of serbs comparatively higher than that in reverse.In recent days we attended the murder of Serbs by Albankosovares mafias, always unpunished.What decision thinks the Council to end once and for all with this ethnic cleaning, and to guarantee respect for human rights to the entire population of Kosovo, regardless of breeds or beliefs?I wanted to thank the answer that Mr. Minister has given, but also remember that, statistically, there is now in Kosovo more violence than before the bombing of NATO."	es
"In this context, water is not a commercial product: it is an essential element for life and people have to have free access to sufficient supply for their normal daily life we ​​consider positive that it is sought to invest trends in water degradation, which are alarming, and that governments usually overlook too frequently.We all know that water is an essential good for humanity and that it is urgent to defend its quality.But equally essential is to keep in mind that the components of the water policy are inseparable and the action in that aspect conditions all others.Now, in the debate and in the proposals there has been preference to the theme ""Physical-chemical and ecological quality of water"" and almost only marginally the perverse effects on the remaining dimensions have been taken into account.Thus, it is necessary to take into account the diversity of the realities of the Member States, the climatic specificities, the hydrological regimes and their variations throughout the year, the social, economic and ecological effects of the application of the norms or also of their absence.The concerns about these issues are those that have made us disagree with some proposals from the Environmental, Public Health and Consumer Policy Commission, especially those that refer to a too restrictive calendar and soon carefully care for social and agricultural aspects, very important for a country like Portugal, in which there are problems of water shortage and, in addition, a poor socioeconomic development.But we also consider that in many cases the proposals of the Commission and the Council are too retrograde, so we want a balanced vote within the conditioning of the proposals presented.The common position of the Council on this proposal of Directive Marco has not disappointed.It is minimalist at quite a few points, especially in relation to the entry dates of a very important number of provisions as well as the number and conditions of application of the repeal.However, the main problem lies in the definition of the objective that the European Union wants to achieve with this text.The objective is, of course, to create, above all, a clear general framework that finally allows simplifying the applicable law in the field.However, in addition to this objective, the union must have the ambition to improve the quality of surface waters as well as groundwater.Public health and drinking water supply, quality and biological diversity, the preservation of landscapes and species are at stake.From this point of view, the common position is weak.I would like our Parliament to defend a more ambitious position than that of the Council, but I would like this position to be also plausible.The requirement of the ""zero discharges"" and ""zero pollution"" level, including substances naturally present in the water, is not realistic.I am not one of those deputies who think that it is essential to adopt, in second reading ""extremist"" amendments whose sole purpose is to condition a margin of maneuver with the perspective of a negotiation with the Council of Ministers."	es
"So the ""Grappa War"" is over.There is peace and we are looking forward to cooperation with South Africa according to the common dreams and values ​​that should have determined our relationship for a long time.I think this is a nice conclusion of the debate, which was quite positive overall, and I would like to thank me again with the rapporteur and the parliament for the cooperation, which in this context in relation to the countries of the Third World.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Stabilization and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia According to the agenda, the report (A5-0031/2000) by Mr. Swoboda follows on behalf of the Committee for Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Joint Security and Defense Policy on the recommendation of the Commission for a decision to authorize the Commission, a stabilization and association agreement with the formerto negotiate Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (SEC (1999) 1279 -C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121 (COS)).President, dear Commissioner Patten, dear colleagues!Today it is about a country that has truly difficult times, a country that has taken a very good development with its own will and certainly also with the support of the international community.Therefore, if the European Union, Council and Commission suggest - and Parliament is going to make this proposal, tomorrow, a stabilization and association agreement first in Southeast Europe, in the Balkan area - I dare to use this term - then this is primarily a thank you or the recognition that Fyrom/Macedonia has developed a good position, but of course economically, but of courseEspecially politically, in view of the war in the neighborhood and also in relation to your own minority.Because having a minority of 33 or 35 % in your own country is not a little thing in view of the surrounding area in which this country is located.The country and its politicians - certainly different here and there - have always done a very good job, and that should be recognized.The Commission suggests that we with the Council to conclude an agreement.I would like to make a few comments, namely regarding those areas in which there may be a little more differentiated views, although in this context I would also like to cut out the work and interest of the Commissioner Patten for Fyrom/Macedonia and for the entire region to a special extent and also mention it appreciatively.First, the regional approach.I think the regional approach is important and necessary if it is understood correctly.There must be the willingness to cooperate.If he is not understood as a compulsion, but as a willingness, as a possibility that should be used by every country, then this approach is correct.Only when we look at Fyrom/Macedonia, then we see that in the neighborhood there are some countries with which this cooperation z.B. is very difficult from an economic point of view, as is difficult with Kosovo and Albania, or politically difficult, such as Yugoslavia.On the other hand, cooperation with Bulgaria, especially those with Greece, has developed positively, which should also be recognized."	de
In Spain - I want to remember all of you - it is not that we are in the electoral period, it is that there are twenty -five days left for the elections.It is a comfort for the commissioner that in twenty -five days these elections are held, so that, probably, this type of questions will not be asked again.If I consider it important to say that Andalusia will receive 50% more in the community framework and that Spain also has a record in terms of the execution of structural funds, which means that the distribution is strictly based on application regulations and that it is decentralized through regional development plans and the different community support frameworks.Finally, I would like to ask Mr. Commissioner a specific question: Do you consider necessary a change in the regulations for the application of structural funds or consider the current distribution criteria acceptable?This debate seems exciting.I perfectly understand that there is a non -exclusively community dimension.Now, the idea must be done that in all countries of the Union there are permanent elections.What pleased me is that, basically, structural funds are subject to debates in Greece, in Spain.Before, we talked right here about citizen debates, of public debates.The more they speak of Europe and what Europe does for everyday life, provided that it is talk objectively, even when there are certain differences, the better.I will not say my opinion, honor, about a possible change in the regulation of structural funds.Not long ago he was accepted - last year - in Berlin.I put it into practice during the next seven years.We will talk about it again on the occasion of the debate on the Cohesion Report, which for me is an important event, here, with their lordships, and before their lordships, to take stock and at the same time to draw perspectives and, at the beginning of next year, the time will come to talk about possible adjustments, possible modifications.At the moment, allow me, I beg you, to apply the regulation that has not yet been applied, since it dates from the Berlin Council.This is what I can say today.Thank you very much, Mr. Barnier, for your answers.Questions 48 to 50 will be answered in writing.Question No. 51 Formulated by (H-0049/00): Subject: New facilities of the OAMI Currently the Office of Harmonization of the Internal Market continues to function in its same provisional facilities despite having opened the new building in the month of June 1999. In the face of such an unusual situation, the commission wonders: What are the reasons why the OAMI has not yet moved to the new facilities?His honor raised a question about this topic in November 1999 and would like to refer to the answer given to him on that occasion.On the other hand, about this new question, I have consulted the president of the Office for the harmonization of the internal market - that is, the office of Alicante - and on behalf of it I can communicate to the following:	es
We will start a large and open consultation process in order to collect the opinions of all the different parties concerned.I consider the process almost as important as the content;We will dedicate all our resources to active participation and invite all interested parties to participate.At the same time, we have also started a process aimed at improving consistency and clarifying, bringing to the surface and making manifest the real or imaginary problems that we encounter in this area.It will be a continuous process that I consider a kind of constant quality control and I invite Parliament to take part in order to improve the consistency of our actions.Mr. President, I first want to thank the President in office for the Amado Council for what he said, as well as the Commissioner Nielson.I am pleased that President Amado spoke of the European Development Fund.The resolution of the problem does not depend on this institution, on the European Parliament, nor on the Commission;Rather, it is up to the Council to take the initiative to provide the Fest of its budget, and therefore it is to the Council that the preaching must be addressed.Mr. President, I also thank Commissioner Nielson, who spoke widely of the new Lomé Convention.This convention, however, is not exactly the topic that we deal with this morning.In reality, it was our intention to speak of consistency: this is the real theme of today.Already at the beginning of the nineties, the European Parliament, the European Commission and the European Council recognized that the degree of consistency of the union policies was not satisfactory, in particular in the sector of development cooperation and in other aspects of European politics.Several times, attention has been solicited for this problem: in 1992, in 1995 and 1997. The resolution we are examining summarized a bit all the attempts made in this regard in the past.I have already proposed questions about this problem as already years.In 1997 the obligation to consistency was even included in the Treaty of Amsterdam and then, in 1998, it was decided that the European Commission would draw up an annual report on the progress made.But what happened since then?We have heard many beautiful words, even this morning, but we have not yet seen any relationship.It almost seems absurd to say, but it is like this: it is widely recognized that the union policy is contradictory, good intentions are constantly formulating, but nothing happens in fact.It is therefore a good thing that this point is today at our agenda.To explain what are the contradictions of the union policy I will resort to some examples.In some developing countries, sugar cane is grown to obtain sugar from it.In the union the sugar is instead obtained from beets.To prevent sugar from a good price from developing countries to compete with the most expensive sugar in the Union, a heavy tax on cane sugar imports has been imposed.Consequently, the imports of this product in the union have dropped considerably.At the same time, to those same countries that produce brown sugar, we provide development aid in large quantities.Once, a minister of a Caribbean island where the sugar cane was grown had to tell me: if you allow us to sell our sugar in the union, we could safely do without your development aid.	it
How should one call the rapes, looting, fire trucks and the deportations declared as cleansing that are reminiscent of the darkest Middle Ages in Europe?How should one denote the isolation of the Russian and international journalists and the exile of humanitarian organizations and every international investigation commission from the places of the massacre?If this is real policy, if we really have no means in our hands, then I ask you, Mr. Hoher representative, Mr. Commissioner, we should at least use the means we have, the aid programs for Russia.The Chechen War proves - if that was still necessary - that the obligation to interference or the right to interference ends at the limit of the large powers.So we ensure that in the future every euro issued in the Russian Federation will be used for nothing other than solving the sufferings of the population affected by the war.Mr. Hoher representative, you have spoken of the previous progress in the implementation of Helsinki's decisions.Some of us are very decided to create a purely European security organization to protect peace in the world.Of course, we recognize the importance of the Security Council for the preservation of peace and international security, which is also anchored in the decisions of Helsinki.However, you have noted that this should also have been questioned in Helsinki, which was also considered in Helsinki, in the recent past.The jumping point is: does the political will exist that this mechanism, which will cover the entire spectrum of Petersberg resolutions, receives really independent skills?What about the infrastructures?Is it planned in any form to ensure this independent skills of the entire system?Second, what should become of the European Defense Industry, which is ultimately integrated into all activities related to the system?Are the current programs continued?If finally, a change in the contract is necessary, how should it be implemented in your opinion, which is presented in Feira, implemented and included in the general process of reforming the institutional framework of the contract?In what context is this in your opinion on the possible introduction of the qualified majority?Are there such considerations?Is this question discussed?To what extent did the cooperation between you and the responsible commissioner have concrete results and a framework strategy how this system can be really efficiently designed in your opinion?Mr President, from my studies in European history, I believe that the Sintra agreement was a controversial peace agreement in 1809, which resulted in an extension than a shortening of the Napoleonic wars and almost cost the Duke of Wellington.I hope this is not an omen for this Sintra agreement.Now I would like to congratulate the high representative for the advances achieved so far.However, it should be noted that in the most part of his explanations about progress in institutional matters, and the true examination for European defense identity will be their ability to produce competence and performance instead of founding facilities with nicely formulated designations.And as far as this is concerned, I am not aware of how far our heavy -duty transport capacities have been developed to bring these 60,000 men to their locations, or what progress we can show in view of an autonomous information service, in particular in view of the announcements of the Americans not to provide the Europeans with no clarification data unless they dominate security.	de
It should be remembered that currently the global competitiveness of the European Union is 81% of that of the United States of America and that this figure will only improve if it improves that of our competitive units that are the regions and this, in addition, at a time when technological evolution, economic globalization and our problems, expansion and unique currency, make regions more enforceable, but also to companies and individuals, a greater competitive effort.The sixth report of the European Commission offers very valuable conclusions.I summarize two of them, the rapporteur, one positive and a negative one has already remembered.The first is that important advances in territorial and social cohesion have been achieved throughout the territory of the Union and that community funds have constituted an important, but non -decisive factor, in the reduction of regional inequalities.The refusal is that this great effort that has been made was more effective in the approach of GDP and the productivity of European regions than in their levels of employment.It is necessary, therefore, to link the structural financing to the creation of jobs.It is, Mr. Commissioner, the first commandment for the next period.Thus, Mr. President, I ask my illustrious colleagues for the approval of this report and ask the Commission, just as other colleagues have made the conclusions of their sixth periodic report in the face of the programming of the period 2000-2006.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, distinguished colleagues, first of all, I want to thank the rapporteur for his good job and for having properly taken the amendments proposed during the process of preparing the report in the parliamentary commission.This sixth periodic report establishes the bases to evaluate the achievement of the objectives of the Regional Policy of the Union.The report shows that, despite all efforts made, growth is unequal.The regions of Central Europe continue to experience very fast development.Also the most prosperous centers continue to grow above the European average, while many regions of southern and Nordic Europe develop much more slowly.Now we need a deep analysis of the reasons why regional policy does not reach the desired results in all regions.Is this due to bureaucracy or that differences between the regions, such as large distances, extreme weather conditions of cold or heat, poor population density and lack of soil fertility have not sufficiently taken into account?How can the union face the challenges that the globalization process brings so that the most backward regions can be integrated into it?It is also important to find out the effects that the extension of the Union will have on the structural funds and in the development of the peripheral regions.Member States must also remember their responsibilities.Some member states have disliked the compensation principle and reduced national subsidies to the regions as the structural funds from the Union have increased.This has neutralized the results of regional policy.In the future, the development of the indicators must also be considered to be able to adopt the appropriate measures and allocate them to the right places.	es
Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, this colleague report, Mr Berend, relates exactly to the strategy adopted by the European Commission, giving the absolute priority to the appearance of the increase in competitiveness.On the other hand, only the wider objectives of the structural funds are mentioned marginally, such as the increase in employment, the improvement of equal opportunities, the greater sustainability of employment and development.I believe that such an approach is unjustified and I ask that the aforementioned points are held in greater consideration.This does not mean that he does not see the need to strengthen competitiveness, especially since I am an entrepreneur who operates in a region of lens 1, that is, in Brandenburg, Germany, and I perfectly know the concerns and needs of small and medium -sized enterprises.In the regions included in goal 1 it is absolutely necessary to introduce term measures to be completed at times to promote the creation of jobs, special programs in favor of youth entrepreneurship and initiatives to support the start of activities on their own.These sectors are subsidized through appropriate interventions envisaged within the framework of the structural funds of the European Union.The only support for the competitiveness of companies cannot allow to achieve the desired cohesion between economic development and social development, given that in the regions included in goal 1 there are no foundations for an autonomous economic recovery.Economic development, alone, does not contribute to reducing unemployment, as evidenced by the fact that at least the 3 percent of increase in the gross national product is needed to create further jobs.By focusing exclusively on economic policy oriented towards supply and supply it is not possible to achieve the desired results.And even if you do it, you must make substantial enhancement investments and less rationalization investments.This must be absolutely associated with an economic policy oriented to the question in order to have the opportunity to improve the situation in these regions.The situations in the various regions are somewhat different and this means that a series of accompaniment measures must be implemented in order to intervene in some way.For example, interventions in the sectors of professional training, permanent training, reintegration of workers expelled from the production process, flexible organization of working hours and types of working hours are required, in order to be able to reconcile personal and social aspects much better and be able to favor access to the women's job market again.Mr. President, my congratulations to the speaker for his in -depth relationship.The main objective of structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions of the European Union.By stimulating the most disparate investments, the union tries to achieve the increase in GDP per inhabitant and grow employment.From the sixth periodic report on the regions it can be deduced, with a certain caution, that the aforementioned incentives do not always have the hoped for effect.The efforts aimed at the increase in GDP per inhabitant in the regions of the objective 1 do not always generate this increase.It cannot be said that it is a satisfactory result, given that the reference period, at least in recent years, has been characterized by an economic recovery.As the speaker points out, not even the structural measures aimed at enhancing employment have given noteworthy effects.	it
"In our opinion, this would be desirable.I wish to formulate some observations regarding costs.Some say that the expenses should be completely incurred by the producers, as this is right and favorable for consumers.This position appears somewhat questionable, since the producers would download all the charges on consumers and create their own monopoly of recycling subjected to state control.I warn you from setting this thesis.There are amendments that propose to divide costs so that they are incurred 50 percent by the producers and for the other half by the buyers of new vehicles.Thanks to this pool, or in any case imagine such a system, starting from 2006 all vehicles in circulation can be withdrawn without any aggravation for the last holder, as my group expressly hopes for.Our proposal on the distribution of costs presents an important advantage, i.e. that we will not be found to be prosecuted by the Court of Justice as soon as the directive has been launched.In fact, the retroactive effect that so restless and worries the automotive industry represents a serious problem that we must keep in due consideration.For this reason I propose a division of costs between the first holder and producer.Prohibition of use of some materials: we need them!In vehicles there are dangerous components that in the long run must be banned.For this purpose, a tool is needed with which to exert the necessary pressure.The proposals made by the Commission are too rigid and we have developed some alternatives.Many valid amendments have been presented.Parliament has conquered greater skills, let's apply them!We must have the courage to propose and develop a directive that indicates the way to go in the future;A directive developed only to do it, it would not be worthy of this assembly!I invite you to give your support to my proposal.Mr. President, I almost want to breathe a sigh of relief: we finally come to the second reading on this directive that has given us a lot of work and who, of course, has given a lot to his speaker, honorable Florenz.In my opinion, this directive is not satisfactory at all because it does not answer the real question: what will be done of the vehicles already abandoned and that can only be removed at the expense of the community and therefore of taxpayers?The ""polluting pays"" principle therefore does not apply.The vehicles already abandoned, are also abandoned by this community legislation, since they are ignored both by the texts relating to landfills, and from this text on the VFUs.The only merit of this directive is to predict the future.However, it was not possible to solve the problem of vehicles currently in use, but already old, whose recycling will cost much more.Instead, you can be confident enough for the future, since we know what efforts are willing to make car manufacturers to find, on the one hand, easier to recycle materials, and on the other, to activate the recycling procedures.I will also insist on the fact that it is essential to maintain a certain flexibility between recycling, reuse and incineration for the particularly light new materials that allow to reduce the consumption of vehicles and therefore emissions."	it
"There have been several examples in Spain: Michelin, Abb-Alstom, and there are examples in Italy that my colleagues will give you.There is also another disguised method of dismissal, which, for example, uses, in Spain the company Ericsson under the name ""outsourcing"" (behind this beautiful word hides that of ""dismissal"").The outsourcing of services, that is to say the subcontracting of services, amounts to transforming a stable and fixed employment in precarious employment, without union rights or social rights.It is indeed a disguised method of dismissal.Mr. Commissioner, the European institutions, if they believe in that they claim and they speak of full employment, will have to take clear measures: review the directives in order to guarantee the participation of workers in these negotiations, review the directive relating to collective layoffs, reduce working time, condition European subsidies to a clear commitment to maintain employment and include social clauses and work in international agreementsthe European Union.Mr. President, this Parliament again discusses business restructuring in Europe and I deplore it.Once again, workers may lose their jobs.Today, we are alluding to the workers of Goodyear from Cisterna Di Latina.As we have already recalled, these are some 600 people and as many families who could, within a month, be deprived of their only source of income.These workers - despite the availability they have shown towards the company and despite their great professionalism thanks to which the Cisterna factory is one of the most productive in Europe - may be excluded from the production circuit.On the other hand, Goodyear, who has benefited, for years, from national and European subsidies, can, quietly and freely, close its doors.I believe that this attitude is not correct: it is not correct with regard to the workers of the Cisterna factory, it is not correct with regard to all Italian and European citizens who allowed Goodyear, even indirectly by the taxes they pay, to benefit from the state aid which I have spoken previously.The European Commission and the Council must assume all the responsibilities linked to this case, both with regard to the adoption of a common position on information and the consultation of workers as well as community and national aid, which must only be granted to companies which undertake to sign long -term agreements in order to protect employment.Today, we ask the Commission to defend, above all, the workers of Goodyear de Cisterna and to exercise all possible pressures on the company in order to reach an agreement, as soon as possible, aimed at ensuring that the Cisterna factory continues to exist and turn.Finally, I would like to remind you, Mr. President and the Commissioner, that the time we have is really limited.Consequently, all the measures - including those already cited by the Commissioner in his introductory report - that we would like to adopt, must be immediately and fall into the subject.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, in terms of restructuring, there is no doubt that European companies must adapt to better face the new challenges, under penalty of having to disappear."	fr
"It is therefore time to flatten all the elements of the chain that participate in the manufacture of yield animal food.Note in passing, and it is a shame, that the problem is much less serious for the food of our dogs, cats and other domestic animals.Is it because of the wild and globalized competition that manufacturers of this sector are engaged in the industry that it has transformed into a recycling sector of all waste in the food industry?Such a serious subject cannot be limited to a technical debate, even if it is already the directive which limits the authorization of antibiotics and other growth factors.The precautions that we are preparing to take for animal feed must also be applied for the food of farm animals, the very ones that we will find on our plate.As this relationship with force points out, labeling is an absolute necessity so that each farmer, in his exploitation, know all the ingredients that enter into the composition of the food he intends to his cattle.He must know, moreover, if GMOs have made their intrusion into his bag of protein pellets.These components can potentially represent a risk to public health.In any case, the precautionary principle imposes the requirement of a traceability clearly displayed at all levels of the marketing of these products.But before labeling, it is necessary to set up clear rules.You have to ask yourself simple questions, such as that of the real purpose of using animal flours.If we look at all the problems they have posed to us, from an ethical point of view and from a health point of view, it is on their very use that we must question themselves today.To do this, the chapter of the White Paper on Food Safety which deals with animal feed must serve us as a workplace to go far beyond the simple commercial questions.The commission has taken this example several times: ""from the fork to the fork"".Our colleague from the PPE highlighted this earlier.It is a good formula, it is still necessary to give it meaning.And to give it meaning, we have to deal with both animal problems and those related to consumer's health.This is why it is important to accept amendment 2 to considering 4, which avoids the risk of monopoly if companies which have already been the first authorized to put an additive on the market remained the only ones who could exploit it during the re -evaluation period.But above all, we must accept amendments 4 and 5 to the new article 2bis, which will clearly designate the genetically modified additives in order to allow users to make a decision with full knowledge of the facts.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, the presence of high -tech additives in the animal feeding sector requires actors - and everyone knows that they are very numerous - the provision of detailed information on their use, to put an end to practices contrary to Community law.The directive in question, on the additives in animal feeding, cannot be enough.Other directives will follow and I think they are in good hands at the Agriculture Commission.The food and the additives are structured, mixed, cut, cut and transported several times until the sale of meat, milk, bread and other products in stores."	fr
"As far as the former is concerned, the Commission gave us a number of proposals that are contained in two guidelines and an action plan, with which the following decision, which the heads of government put into tampers in tampers, is to be implemented: ""A fair treatment of third -country nationals, which are legitimate in the territory of its Member States.To recognize obligations such as EU citizens "".Exactly the opposite of what we have seen and found in El Ejido these days: a world of violations, work exploitation and miserable living conditions that have already been charged.I hope for an early implementation of the measures to integrate, and I also hope that the governments that found such beautiful words in Tampere - among them the government of Spain - are also comprehensive for their implementation.I have less hope in developing an effective and just European politics, which is coherent with the explanations of the Council in the field of immigration.The only proposal received is the guideline for family reunification, a key topic - we saw many single men in El Ejido these days in the media - but we do not know whether it has already been accepted by the governments.Outside the common area, some governments make efforts to redesign their immigration policy.This is done in my country, regardless of the government;The ruling party is the only one who fails the new foreigners law.The goal of combating racism and xenophobia mentioned in the contracts should adopt all institutions and all the politically responsible for the Union.On February 28, 1998, the European political parties signed the Charter of Political Parties for Europe for a society without racism.The People's Party also did it.This commits you to a coherent behavior, but local leaders of this party still pour oil into the sparked fire by boycotting the extinguishing tests of other institutions.The party, which the mayor of El Ejido belongs, should act consistently.Only in great unity, as Mr. Hernández said Mollar, El Ejido, and with him all of Spain and Europe, can manage facts that are deeply shaped by us today.President!In view of the scenes of a real lynch justice against Moroccan workers, as they have played in El Ejido, one can only feel disgust and outrage.To what extent the racist right -wing extremist commands are responsible or the simple people who are careless and thoughtlessly the same as these commands.We would like to express our unrestricted solidarity with these Moroccan employees, who are not only exploited by unscrupulous employers, but are also victims of such attacks.If there are members of the simple referendum among the aggressors, we can only tell you that you shovel your own grave with your actions.When they wage war against people who are as poor as they are, they only do a service to their own exploiters and prepare a future of oppression for themselves.An even greater responsibility than the rackets armed with knives and iron rods bear those who operate racist, xenophobic agitation, those who keep in Spain, Austria, France or elsewhere, and even here in this meeting room, demagogical xenophobic speeches.They are no better than those who take this reactionary absurd demagogy for bare coin."	de
"We have all instruments, all instruments we need, but we have to bundle them much more effectively than before, and that is the challenge that the high representative and I will face in the next four to five years.Now I hope that when we master these challenges, we will receive support in the form of adequate middle equipment as well as brilliant rhetoric.We all know that there are a number of reasons to build a common foreign and security policy.I would like to give you three of them: Bosnia, Albania, Kosovo.These are three reasons for a common foreign and security policy, and we will be measured by how successfully the common foreign and security policy we developed will be, especially how we deal with the events in the Balkans.We must not lose sight of the fact that quite a few of our critics, quite a few American politicians and quite a few senators and congress members ask: ""How should we take them seriously when developing a common foreign and security policy if they don't even get the problems at your own doorstep?"" So the big test for us will be the Balkans.I hope that all those heads of government, all the prominent politicians in our Member States, who promised the blue from heaven for the Balkans, have promised the Marshall plans and gave the Balkans all the other promises that they are there if the household authority makes their decision, how much we have to spend on the Balkans.My great hope would be that we all live on a planet, whose inhabitants also include the European Council, the Council General Affairs and the Council of Economic and Financial Questions.Everyone lives together on the same political planet and ensure that there is a certain agreement between what we have promised to the world and what we can indeed realize.In the past few months of my activity, I have heard assurance that we will be more involved in Latin America, I have heard promise that we will pay for it in the event of an agreement in the Frieden process in the Middle East.I also heard of our project to build a stability pact in the South Caucasus.And I heard the promise that we want to ensure democracy in Indonesia by supporting this country more.How do we get the cow off the ice?And this should not be alluded to one of the political disputes of the recent past.In my opinion, we should always turn to this question in the coming weeks and months.One of the reasons, which is why I am so passionate about the implementation of an effective reform of our foreign assistance programs, is that I do not want to get into a situation again where someone is asking a question of how those to deep gap between rhetoric and reality, and the answer is: ""Oh, we know that they do not work very effectively, we know that they have not kept all their obligations, we know that there is still some money in theirPantry "".I want us to be able to say: ""It is no longer."	de
"Similarly, the concept of the author / author is not defined in the treaties.The Commission has not answered the questions on the basis of which definition wants to act and if it intends to resolve the foreseeable conflicts imposing on others its definition of the legal concept.One of the most delicate points is the public interest: Will the transposition and application of the Wipo lead to the privatization of creation?And finally, the question of the relationship between the trips and the Wipo also here is also the silence of the commission for ""response.""If in a parliamentary debate announced nothing is contributed to the clarification of the problems or to the adoption of positions, then we must, at least, refrain!Graefe Zu Baringdorf (A5-0015/2000) Report after the EEB scandals and dioxins, food security issues are the center of attention.The OGM continue to present many uncertainties, from the point of view of their environmental repercussions, for human and animal health.Therefore, where there is no scientific certainty, the precautionary principle must prevail.A deeper study of the use of biotechnology should be done and it should not be ""packaged"" from now on for sale in the name of the profit of some multinationals in the sector.For the rest, profit has been the engine of the current crises in the level of food security.Within that framework, it is in which the rapporteur is located, by legally framing the issue of OGM with animal feed, remembering that they ""can only be authorized, in case they are harmless to human health and for the environment.""In addition, it considers that the ""genetically modified additives must be clearly indicated as such in all labels, administrative documents or accompanying documents of another type.""That will allow greater control and traceability of these additives and guarantee the freedom of choice of the consumer.After Montreal's agreement on genetically modified organisms (OGM), I consider positive that the speaker has included these issues in his report and, therefore, I have voted in favor of his report.Stenzel (A5-0034/2000) Report, Mr. President, I would like to give a vote explanation very briefly, on behalf of the PPE group, with respect to the Equal report.We have followed a voting list that was exactly equal to that previously agreed with the socialist group.That group has changed their minds, hence the report is now less clear than, otherwise, it would have been.This is the reason we refrain.We want the report on Equal, which is very important for both refugees and the elderly, disabled and women, normally continue.It is unfortunate that the procedure has given rise to this report receiving such unavailable attention in this plenary session.I am convinced that the nationality of the rapporteur has played a certain role, something that should not happen in this Parliament.It is really contrary to European values, and, safely, contrary to the values ​​that are so often spoken in this Parliament."	es
In view of the attitude that we took in Seattle, I am surprised to implement the silence of the failure of the EU to implement the calibration of trade, which had already been decided for developing countries in the GATT negotiations, including the extremely important textile sector.With regard to the common agricultural policy, the greatest culprit, the developmental effects of the GAP reforms were not assessed as part of the Agenda 2000.The scandal about the system of export refunds is generally known: 54,000 tons of excess, subsidized beef were exported to the West African markets at dumping prices, and this resulted in a burglary of the producer prices for the local cattle breeders by 50 %.300,000 tons of beef are currently stored.Who will be the next victim?I welcome the explanation of Mr. Amado, in which he pointed out the problems in connection with the lack of inclusion of the EEF in the budget this morning, and in which a more active role in the development council and the consideration of development priorities as a central element of the new common foreign and security policy are required.I also welcome the explanation of the 1992 Council, its resolution of 1997 and the subsequent changes in the contract of the European Union.So far, the necessary measures have not been initiated.For this reason, we demand annual reports that we are calling for a cross -departmental working group that meets once a year, and we call for a lawsuit to ensure that the corresponding measures really take place.I ask Mr. Nielson to comment directly on these points of the resolution.President!I just want to say something about the connection between development cooperation and agriculture.In recent years, a significant part of the funds has flowed into the development of agriculture and cattle breeding in developing countries, especially in the Lomé countries.The results certainly do not meet our expectations.What could that be due to?I think the cause is mainly in the lack of consistent agricultural policy in certain developing countries, even if this certainly does not apply to everyone.The Commission has an important role in developing such a policy.No farmer, wherever in the world, will create something if the prices are too low.Governments in developing countries always face a difficult decision: Who should they support, the farmers or the people in the big cities who want to buy inexpensive food?This sensitive balance must be found together with the Commission and not by it: in most countries in which the Commission is active, development aid is also provided by the Member States.Member States' policy must not contradict the Commission's Politics.The commission delegations in developing countries are responsible for playing a leading role in the development of this political dialogue and ensuring that all countries control the same course.Particular attention must also be paid to the means of production.Far too often, artificial fertilizers, animal medication and many other things are made available free of charge.If the project has expired after five years, this policy of gifts also ends.In this respect, the cost element should be developed from the start in the politics of all projects.As far as I know, this is far from the case.	de
"My second question refers to Africa, which, in contrast to all other continents, is also not mentioned in Shaping the New Europe.In Africa we have most refugees in the world, the greatest poverty and a devastating AIDSepidemia.I know that Commissioner Nielson and others do a good job in this area, but the entire commission must, even in its strategic goals, focus more on this continent.Finally, I can be underlined that I welcome the commission to explain the first time that the EU is ready to take one -sided measures in order to grant developing countries more access to our markets.My question is: When will this be done?President, Mr President of the Commission, venerated colleagues, lies a document in front of us that is of crucial importance for the future and fate of Europe.For us, however, an immediate challenge mean two aspects under all the points mentioned that are closely interwoven: peace and stability in Europe and outside of Europe.These goals must primarily be pursued, which has long been our common endeavor, but we also have to make it clear that they cannot be achieved without the expansion - may they also cause costs.We are called today to choose between one less enough for the coming decades, but for the entire planet a lamp of peace and civilization Europe and a perhaps richer Europe without future visions.However, these goals can only be realized if, in the end of the government conference that ended in one year, a constitutional reform takes shape in the context of which the commission, which may not be an executor of the decisions of the council or the co -decisions of the parliament, but must also take on the role of a real government of Europe, adequate and real powers are transferred.Parliament would have to be the first proponent of this reform if it really wants to expand its role as the mouthpiece of the Union citizens' will and take over the central function of how it stands for a really democratic and strongly integrated Union.In addition, the Commission can only stand within the framework of the powers actually transferred to it for the obligations taken over.Without these perspectives, Europe would look forward to a hopeless future.President, Mr, Mr President, we can only welcome the announced ambitious goals that are in line with the challenges before Europe.As I state, the fall of the Berlin Wall is the most important event for you at the end of this century.This event forms the basis for the expansion.However, I would prefer this word ""extension"" and rather speak of reunification, because this seems to me to have much stronger political importance.They take up the idea of ​​concentrating their work more on the core tasks, and make this a goal of their reforms.Basically, it is about the use of the principle of subsidiarity.The clear application of this principle can only increase the measures carried out and convey a clear idea of ​​any level of responsibility to the citizens.Yes, Mr. Prodi, to announce this is one thing to carry out it completely different!"	de
"As in Spain, in April 1998, as in Brittany and Vandea since last December, an exceptional natural zone is seriously threatened.In its resolutions, the European Parliament does not cease to attract attention to this kind of dangers that threaten our environment, upset our ecosystem and destabilize populations again.This new catastrophe poses the problem of the integration of the community ""collection"" in environmental matters for candidate countries.The obstacles that the authorities of these states must overcome, still fragile from the environmental point of view, are numerous.First, the prevention of this type of discharge should be improved, conditioning the most critical industrial locations.Secondly, these countries should be able to have sufficient technical means to stop such pollution and reduce their scope.Finally, they should be able to apply recovery programs of the most affected and most sensitive areas.Today the banks and the waters of more than four rivers that cross four states are contaminated.That is why the European Union must concentrate its efforts and exercise its pressures so that all candidate countries necessarily adapt to community environmental protection standards.But above this, what is in question are technologies and the means available to prevent and to deal quickly and effectively to this type of catastrophes.I want our future partners to demonstrate greater responsibility.The environment must be a priority within the framework of the reunification of the European continent.It must be the core of the political wills of our partners.The application of high environmental standards will allow not only the development of important industrial and technological sectors, but also will simultaneously carry favorable social and economic consequences and improve public health standards.You have to reinforce the efforts already undertaken.The European continent must express its solidarity and responsibilities must be clearly delimited within the framework of the principle ""who pollutes pays.""Mr. President, when the Catastrophe of Doñana occurred, the World World Wide Fund - World for Nature - presented a report on the amount of rafts in Europe of these characteristics.We all know that there is a huge number of this type of rafts, which are an ecological bomb and that affect the supply of drinking water, ecological wealth and also to the economic future of these areas.I was in Doñana after the spill and I could see how agriculture, fishing and life of the citizens of the surrounding area looked greatly compromised.Therefore, I believe that the European Union must, in the first place, an analysis of the situation of these rafts and a rigorous record of the number of them we have in Europe.You must proceed to the inclusion of these rafts in community law, in the directives that have to do with the waste, and use the prevention principle to prevent this from happening again.If not, we will be continuously endangering the ecological wealth of our continent.Mr. President, this catastrophe in the Romania mine includes a vast hydrogeological sector with rivers and streams in Romania, Hungary, Serbia and Bulgaria.The discharge in the ecosystem of 100,000 m3 of water contaminated with cyanide and heavy metals will have huge consequences, for a long time, for the inhabitants of these regions, for flora and fauna, for agriculture, for tourism and for the entire ecosystem and biological diversity."	es
It should be remembered that during the Conference on Rural Development which was held in Cork from November 7 to 9, 1996, rural development was defined as one of the priorities of the European Union, insofar as it is essential to preserve the integrity of our agriculture and the whole of the rural fabric (infrastructure, public and private services ....).In this context, we have deplored in commission of credits devoted to rural development and supported the amendments requesting an increase in the budget for this community initiative, so that it is in line with the previous leaders leader I and Leader II.Compared to this latest initiative which had a period limited to 6 years, the budget allocated to leader +, for a period of 7 years, is 50 %.This is not eligible with regard to the importance of rural development and the consequences, for farmers, the fall in prices and aids such as it is planned in the reform of the CAP following the Berlin agreements.Finally, among the priority parameters which will be introduced on the European scale to allow local inscriptions, special attention must be paid to the quality and originality of projects which have already been carried out by GAL within the framework of Leader II initiative, but which could not succeed due to the calendar and the heaviness of the planned management devices.(The session, suspended at 1:40 p.m., is resumed at 3 p.m.) Additives in animal feed The agenda calls for the report (A5-0015/2000) of Mr. Graefe Zu Baringdorf, in the name of the Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development, on the proposal for a directive of the Council modifying the 70/524/EEC directive in the additives in the food of animals (1999) 388 -388 -C5-0134/1999 - 1999/0168 (CNS)).Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner byrne, Directive 70/524 currently provides for different treatments for high -tech additives in the replacement of existing authorizations.The Commission now proposes to harmonize the procedures of authorization, so that the substances which have been authorized before 1988 are set up with equality with that which is authorized now.In this regard, the Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development is in agreement.However, the directive also includes the authorization of antibiotics, other drug substances, growth factors and genetically modified organisms.It is about health here and not a simple harmonization of legislation.The Agriculture Commission is therefore of the opinion that the legal basis - Article 37 - is not eligible here and that the Commission must rather offer us a legal basis based on article 152, which provides for the codecision of Parliament.We asked for the advice of our legal committee, which indicated, concerning this harmonization of legislation, that article 37 would suffice in this case.We, the Commission for Agriculture,, however, were not limited to the treatment of this harmonization of legislation;We have filed another amendment, given the fact that this proposal also relates to genetically modified organizations, and this amendment addresses the question of content and also, therefore, the health of the population.We have negotiated two years with the Commission for the seed directive and we found a compromise that governs the dissemination of genetically modified organizations in this directive.To do this, we started from the basic text for this 70/524 directive.Mr. Byrne, we do not understand why the commission undertakes harmonizations and does not also provide for the harmonization of the text concerning genetically modified organisms.	fr
"Why shouldn't one put a kind of technological convergence criterion in Lisbon, according to which the Member States should increase their research and development effort to at least 2.5 % of their GDP within five years, which would still be below the current proportion of the United States?In this context, I would also like to welcome the initiative of Commission member Philippe Busquin to create a European research area.Better living conditions, employment and the quality of employment will continue to depend to a large extent on our ability to stimulate European research.This would also be a real European patent, the development of risk capital, the support of young companies of decisive importance.President Predi received my execution about the future deficit in Europe last night.However, I think he misunderstood me, because I did not charge the Portuguese chair or the Commission that they lack a long time, but spoke of the fear of the future that many of our fellow citizens grasped in a strongly changing world.We are all aware that the development of the information society means a paradigm shift.But in a world in which 1.5 billion people still live without electrical streams, the inclusion of all people in the world in the internet society cannot be realized in the immediate future.The biggest challenge for humanity is to avoid the division into ""info-rich"" and ""low-info"" countries, to prevent the origin of companies in which the digital breaks are the new social breaks after the apt expression of my friend Claude Desama.The annual legislative program is the most concrete expression of the constitutional and political key powers of the European Commission, thanks to which it has the sole right of initiative.Such powers must always be right and clearly justified.As in all previous years, this year's work program remains a detailed justification for each of the numerous newly proposed measures.The 15-page general summary of the 500 initiatives, which are listed in the appendix, really does not do justice.In future, the ELDR will therefore insist on a clear reason for all measures announced in the work program and a corresponding special parliamentary debate.Above all, we are concerned with evidence that every new proposal has been examined in detail whether it withstands the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality.Furthermore, we will be concerned with sector -specific debates in the special committees of the European Parliament.In other words, it is high time that the somewhat antiquated procedure according to which this decisive program document is developed and discussed is subjected to general overhaul.Mr President, I would like to thank the President of the Commission for talking to us twice within 24 hours.Yesterday evening he clearly and clearly stated that the prospects for the European economy are very positive for the next two to three years and that the unexpectedly above -average growth rates will make it easier for us to achieve the goals of this annual legislative program.In his contribution from this morning, the Commission President appeals three problems that make me worry.The first concerns the subsidiarity, in which our faction exists very much, and the liberals have already referred to the fact that it must be demonstrated for each individual proposal that it is in the interests of Europe."	de
"I do not know whether this information is correct, but we as an EPP ED faction would be grateful if this point were discontinued because the parliament has already dealt with this question several times.There are also resolutions against such a tax.That is why my parliamentary group requests that this point be deducted from the agenda.Thank you very much, Mr. Poettering.We are now coming to Mr. Wurz, who speaks against the application.Ms. President, I would like to point out that what Mr. Poettering says is not quite logical.On the one hand, he teaches the social democratic faction because it questions a very clear and clear decision by the President's conference.And now it does exactly the same.We discussed, we agreed, only the EPP faction and the liberals.And I had also pointed out that the other presidential colleagues will remember that it is not about whether one is for or against Tobin tax, but whether we are willing to listen to what the Commission and the Council think of it.That is not too much required.So I repeat the proposal to maintain this oral request to the Commission and the Council in order to experience the opinion of these two institutions for this relatively modest proposal, which would be an important signal for the public, especially after the excitement of the failure of the Seattle conference.We are now coordinating the PPE/DE faction's request to deduct the oral request for capital tax from the agenda.(The parliament rejects the application with 164 yes votes, 166 no votes and 7 abstentions.) Mrs. President, I would like to thank Mr. Poettering for stirring the advertising drum in favor of this pronunciation.Thank you.Mrs. President!Has my voice counted?I couldn't hand it over electronically because I didn't have the card.I voted ""for that"".In fact, if you add the two members who have registered, then result as a result ... Ms. President!The presidency announced the result of the vote.Changes are not possible.Mrs. President, in the earlier vote on the question of the commission's strategy plan - are not afraid that I will adhere to her decision in this matter - I asked to be able to speak in the name of my parliamentary group before voting.This did not happen.I would welcome it if I had the opportunity to end this business point to give an explanation for voting on behalf of my faction.That is an important matter.Perhaps it would make sense to keep in which what we just did is accepted by the individual against the background of their own political analysis.Mrs. President!I don't want to resume the debate, but I also reported to comment on Mr. Barón Crespo's application.You didn't call me either.I regret that, but the vote has been carried out, the decision has been made, so we leave things.I'm sorry, Mr. Hänsch and Mr. Cox.I hadn't seen them asked for the word.But the positions have become clear and are included in the protocol."	de
"The deputy rightly refers to the strategic importance of these regions.We take part in programs in the region that also affect the environment.There is a direct connection between our food programs and structural reforms in agriculture and the relief of poverty.These programs themselves are intended to help agriculture to receive a more solid basis and to stop predatory construction.We should continue to grant this ecological aspect priority in the future.We also take note of the fact that the MP who wrote the request has applauded the answer of the Commissioner.This is not common.In addition, the Lord has not cited a bibliography in this case.Thank you very much, Mr. Patten, for your today's contributions.Inquiry No. 35 of (H-0778/99): Concerns: Greek Action Plan for Employment According to the results of the evaluation of the action plans for employment, Greece and Italy are the most affected countries of critical comments from the Commission, both with regard to the inconsistency of plans as well as the measures and policies to support employment.The report indicates that in Greece and Italy the goals to improve the ""employment ability"" have not been achieved and it is uncertain whether the politics to be carried out are sufficient to prevent and combat long -term unemployment.With regard to Greece, it is also pointed out that there is no program for medium and long-term measures to reduce tax burdens and social security contributions in the area of ​​employment and for the satisfactory use of the ESF to support employment policy, and that there are also no exact employment figures.Can the Commission report whether the Greek government has adopted concrete obligations b and which B with regard to the way the problem of youth unemployment and long -term unemployment can be managed and whether it has set and implemented a suitable system for localization, registration and control of the fluctuation of unemployment or whether most measures are still limited to listing unemployment?To the request of Mr. Papayannakis: As part of the 1999 package of measures, the Commission has directed certain recommendations to Greece in order to make the measures to promote employment more efficient.These recommendations essentially suggest that more intensive efforts to reform public services in problem areas to improve the system of statistical recording and to apply preventive policies in accordance with guidelines 1 and 2 of the employment package.In the course of its employment policy, the Greek government announced two concrete programs in 1999: ""Yes to professional life"" and ""Back in Work"".Since there are no final results for these programs, we cannot first make a statement about whether the quantitative goals have been achieved.The Greek government now admits that there is a problem in that it is not possible to grasp the fluctuation of unemployment.It has therefore committed itself to, firstly, to restructure the state employment offices, secondly to create efficient centers for employment promotion - a corresponding program has started, but has not yet been completed - and thirdly, to introduce electronic employment cards and use suitable computer systems in order to be able to pursue the implementation of all of these policies."	de
It is about strengthening banking supervision.It is about clarifying liability for transactions.It is about a regulatory framework at the international level.It is about a review of national laws whether they correspond to the rules of the Basel Committee and how they can be spread more.In the present resolution, I have a major problem in a central point, which we cannot accept.This is point 9. If we have now listened to the Commissioner, we know that the commission's expertise will lead to a no to Tobin Tax.If the expertise and this debate and the arguments are as we do and how I think it is right, but then the Commission is also responsible for a further six months and thus an uncertainty of the financial and capital market.The capital market does not need uncertainty from us, the capital market needs clarity from us.Therefore, we reject point 9 and call for a separate vote.Mrs. President!The debate about taxing short -term financial transactions is not new.We have been discussing the Tobin tax proposal for twenty years, and yet this question is always up to date, because we need really concrete and honest answers on the basis of careful studies.We need to know how desirable and how feasible a taxation of short -term financial transactions is actually.This question is indeed in a different dimension today when $ 1,500 billion around the world vagabonds for 24 hours a day in search of attractive systems, and at most 3% of them are associated with the real economy.We worry about the stability of the financial markets, not for the sake of financial markets, but because it is also about our own growth, our own investments, our own jobs in the European Union.Here we have to ask which instruments we can use in order to actually create a certain order here that has been missing so far.We have contributed to the liberalization of the financial transactions, but we still have no functioning set of rules, and we have had to experience the bitterly in the effects of the Asia crisis and the Latin America crisis.It is therefore high time that on the one hand we think of supervisory rules and on the other hand of transparency on the financial markets and their information.It is important that we know which actors exist and what credit ratings they have.We also have to ask ourselves whether there is a commandment of tax justice.At a time when the tax burden on the factor work across Europe, but also internationally, we have to consider which forms we come to efficient taxation of capital gains in, and we also have to ask ourselves the question about the taxation of short -term financial transactions.I really think it is necessary that we will receive a careful report and a conclusion from the Commission so that we as a European Parliament can see whether we do not have to ensure that the European Union, together with the USA and Japan, really gets international solidarity in order to make the economy and the financial markets more stable and safer.	de
"Consequently, without such an active role in the ""development"" council in the global coordination of political decisions that develop on the sidelines of its decision -making center and directly affect the development policy of the European Union, it will certainly be difficult to develop a more coherent policy of the European Union compared to the development objectives.The speech and reflection of the European Parliament will certainly be appropriate and welcome here too.Let me start by saying a few words about the negotiations between the EU and the ACP countries that have successfully concluded.I would like to point out that participating in these negotiations was a very positive experience.I saw member states working as a team, a great experience indeed.The two parties were deeply satisfied at the end of the negotiations, not only because they had ended, but also because we all knew that we had accomplished something together, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.The world needs this and the signal sent is very positive as part of the general discussion on globalization.I will highlight some of the new features contained in this new agreement.We explicitly approach the question of corruption;We establish a framework in order to deal with the problem of immigration, for the very first time.We encourage participatory approaches, we ensure that civil society is consulted on the reforms and policies that the EU must support.We again focus development policies on poverty reduction strategies.We are not only based on the allocation of funds on an evaluation of the needs of each country, but also on an assessment of their performance in terms of policy.We create an investment system to support the development of the private sector.We rationalize the instruments and introduce a new rotating programming system that allows the community and beneficiary countries to regularly adjust their cooperation program.We decentralize administrative and sometimes financial responsibilities at local levels in order to improve cooperation.We improve the political framework for the development of trade and investments.We are strengthening cooperation in all sectors that are of commercial importance, including new points such as labor standards and links between the environment and trade.After Seattle, I am sure you will realize the meaning of these agreements.I now go to some of the more important points.First, the agreement concerning political issues.The new agreement will imply a firm commitment on the part of the two parties in terms of good management of the government as a fundamental and positive element of the partnership, a subject having to be the subject of a regular dialogue in a sector which benefits from the active support of the community.Second, a new procedure has been conceived in the event of human rights violations, democratic principles and the rule of law.In comparison with the current procedure, the new procedure puts more emphasis on the responsibility of the state concerned and it allows greater flexibility in the consultation process, in order to carry out a productive dialogue leading to measures to be taken in order to redress the situation.In the event of a particular emergency, namely serious violations of one of these fundamental elements, measures will be taken immediately and notification will be made to the other party."	fr
Certainly, an effective competition policy constitutes the premise of a proper functioning of the internal market and the economic and monetary union.However, as the rapporteur indicates, these aid are sometimes indispensable and can allow, in addition to the survival of some companies, to contribute to sustainable development (article 6 of the Treaty), to services of general interest (article 16) and economic and social cohesion (article 158).However, it is clear that they must be controlled and this task looms the European Commission.The aid that the Member States of the Union dedicate to the sectors considered every year have reached, in the period 1995-1997, a total of 95 billion euros, of which 40 percent for the manufacturing sector.These aid decreased considerably compared to the previous period, 1993-1995, (decrease in 13 percent of the total amount and from 3.8 to 2.6 percent of the amount dedicated to aid for the manufacturing sector).This drop in aid is explained above all with the decrease in the aid granted to the new German Länder.Like the rapporteur, I also deplore that the data presented in the report do not include all state aid.The European Commission must remedy as quickly as possible to these deficiencies.It must also cooperate with the Member States to improve the quality of data in time, that is, for the ninth census.It would be a good thing that the Commission published a register in which the amounts of state aid by member country are entitled.It also deploes that the European Parliament is totally excluded from the Consultative Committee for state aid.To remedy this situation, the European Commission must take on the obligation to present us regular relationships.I will conclude on an aspect of the use of state aid that seems particularly dangerous to me: these are aid that result in a transfer of business from one Member State to the other, with the risk of hunting to subsidies without them being able to contribute to the achievement of the common objectives of the EU.For this reason I hope that in the next census of state aid there is the evaluation of the impact of these aid on employment as well as on the sectors of industry and crafts in the beneficiaries.Langen Report (A5-0073/1999) this morning, in the context of the important discussion on the competition, I expressed myself on the text of the honorable Langen concerning the application in 1998 of the sixth code of the aid to the steelurgery.As has been recognized by the Court of Justice in its sentence of 3 May 1996, the steel sector is particularly sensitive to competitive disturbances.Therefore, it was legitimate to establish a regime of state aid to this sector in order to guarantee the survival of valid companies, although article 4, point C, of ​​the Czech treaty, prohibits any state aid to steel.This is, in reality, the theme of the sixth aid code to the steel industry.At the same time, of course, it is essential to avoid any threat to the conditions of competition and any serious disturbance of the markets and from this derives the importance of regulating these aid.It is therefore necessary to continue to give state aids only to research, development, protection of the environment and aid granted in the event of the closure of the plants.	it
Madam President, I would also like to applaud the initiative that the Commission had to present a report to us on its strategic objectives for the next five years, although I hope that it intends to correct, in subsequent documents, the excess of generalities and the imprecision of the text that we analyze today.That said, the president, I will again denounce the absence of the fishing policy, even if I am hardly listening to me.It is really surprising that the Commission does not place among its strategic objectives for the coming years the process of revising one of its common policies for the reform which must take place in 2002. This revision process is, without the shadow of a doubt, the most important event of those who will affect the fishing sector for many years.But, at first glance, this is not the opinion of the Commission, which is responsible for presenting to the Council and Parliament, before the end of 2001, the report on the functioning of the common fishing policy in the last decade, on the basis of which the Council will have to make the adequate decisions to modify it.In fact, the revision process has already started for many groups and institutions, as for the European Parliament which, in 1998, had already dictated and approved a report incorporating all the problems and faults that the common fishing policy currently includes.We have repeatedly asked for a minimum calendar for this revision but we did not obtain an answer.Less than two years, it is not much if we recall more that the fishing policy is experiencing an anomal situation with regard to internal market standards and that a solution should be found in these anomalies within the framework of the reform procedure.Consequently, the president, Mr. Chairman of the Commission, I request that this point, which is of paramount importance for such an important sector of the European Union, is taken into consideration in this strategy and in these strategic objectives for the next five years.Madam President, I also wish to address my congratulations to the Prodi Commissioner for her program.I am particularly delighted that it has recognized this virtuous circle that constitutes sustained growth: the information company within a European expansion market with, moreover, an effective single currency will give us the opportunity to really develop prosperity, the spirit of innovation, the business spirit and, yes - the most important element - of sustainable jobs with very high added value for European citizens.I have an observation, not a criticism, to formulate with regard to the declaration of this morning of the prodist commissioner, namely that she was a little weak on the real content of economic policy.We must not consider anything acquired with regard to the way of achieving the restructuring of the European economy.After all, what is social justice without full employment?Full employment is the best way to achieve social justice for our citizens.It is for us a fundamental priority on which we must concentrate our efforts.	fr
This is the proof, if it was still necessary, that an immature diplomacy, which defends no interest, except undoubtedly particular interests, stuck between the theology of free trade, the pressure groups and the NGOs more or less friendly, is not only effective, but dangerous.Finally, a word on the general inspiration of the Corrie report.Today the joint assembly is considered, do not hide it, as an obstacle to international free trade by theologians of Geneva and Washington.This was an opportunity to recall that our mode of cooperation with the countries of the South, original and exemplary, was to be developed, reinforced.This opportunity is an opportunity missed by the Corrie report and, with regret, we must sanction the fact that it has been lost to this point.Mr. President, as a conclusion and synthesis, I would like to highlight three essential aspects of this debate.First, the idea that emerges very firmly from all interventions is that globalization accentuates regional imbalances and social inequalities, that it increases poverty.It is therefore necessary to do something, under penalty of aggravating tensions and bringing out mechanisms triggering conflicts that call into question international peace and stability.Second, in this perspective, it would be important to give another dimension to development policies by valuing their role in the correction of imbalances, attenuation of inequalities.I think everyone agrees with the capital importance of the European Union role in development policies on an international scale.Everyone recognizes, such was the theme of today's debate, that the European Union assumes a more active and advanced role in development policies on an international scale, it will necessarily have to strengthen the coherence of its various policies which participate in development objectives.I think that certain interventions have also insisted that this responsibility vis-à-vis the coherence of European Union policies does not include exclusively on the Council, the Commission or the Parliament;On the contrary, it will have to be the subject of a consultation of the work of reflection and legislative and institutional preparation, both at the level of the Commission and at the level of the Council, as well as at the level of the European Parliament itself.Some deputies have also presented suggestions, such as that of the creation of an observatory or a working group to support the action of the various policies in the specific field of development.As was one of the priorities of the Portuguese presidency program, I would finally like to emphasize that it is also important to record the assertion that it is necessary to enhance the development policy in the context of European Union policies and in particular in the context of its foreign policy.We think it is absolutely essential;Otherwise, it will not be possible to develop a substantial action in terms of coherence of policies, if we are not able to give a leading role to development policies as an instrument for the affirmation of principles and values ​​that model Europe's assertion in the international system.	fr
We in the community, in the European Union have an important role here.Save is the only community -wide program dedicated to promoting rational energy use.It is based on non -technical elements and contributes to building an infrastructure for energy efficiency.The aim of the program is to create an environment in which investments and energy efficiency are promoted.At this point we also have to make ourselves aware that there is a market potential for energy saving in industry.We have heard a lot of competitive difficulties in renewable energy sources, but energy savings can be saved in the company, actually anywhere, money, so that this should not be a problem.This is something we can support.I have to say that, like motherhood, we all support this, but sometimes do very little to really help the mothers or those who are committed to saving energy.We could actually do more if we consider what major commitments we have received when reducing CO2 and greenhouse gases as well as when reducing the dependence on energy imports.We do not take the kind of measures that citizens want to see.We do not establish the necessary connection so that the citizens can actually do something at home or in the office or in the company to support the measures directed against climate change.If we could pass on this message, it would be a very exciting thing.I would like to thank everyone who has participated in this mediation procedure again.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!I would like to thank Ms. Ahern again for her work as a rapporteur, because with the participation of the other parliamentary members, she contributed to the fact that in the end there is a very reasonable result that in some aspects even improves one or the other proposal of the Commission itself and of course what the advice had initially accepted from the point of view of the household.As Ms. Ahern said correctly, both the budget for the Save program and the most symbolic budgets for the programs for the program are, because the weight bears the countries, the states of the Union, the regions or in some cases even the municipal administrations.But in any case, despite the relatively low volume, the programs have an important symbolic value that shows that there is a will in the community to support these types of measures that contribute to the fact that we really fulfill our commitments from Kyoto and also achieve more diversification in our energy sources, a stronger supply of supply and, if necessary, reduce consumption and higher efficiency in energy consumptionachieve a contribution to achieving the goals made.In addition, a technological challenge of the highest importance results in connection with the SAVE program SAVE higher efficiency and energy saving and with the program of old renewable energies, which can bring significant opportunities for industry and also for the creation of jobs in our countries and consequently throughout the Union.	de
To this end we have presented some amendments, and we hope that Parliament accepts them: first, to offer the former Yugoslava Republic of Macedonia the exemption of customs rates in their exports to the European Union and compensation of the progressive reduction of customs rights applied to Macedonia on European products, with the condition that the principle of a joint customs control is accepted in the macery borders;Second, that is encouraged to AryM with adequate financial support to integrate its currency into the euro, as a first step towards a Europeanization of its entire economy, with the subsequent purpose of eliminating any possible corruption in the banking system;Third, that the help and assistance that the world must give to the region, and therefore also to Macedonia, has well marked its multilateral character, without the beneficiary country being conditioned by obligations with the donor country.Mr. President, Ladies, Mr. Commissioner, we hope that the agreement can achieve all the planned objectives, but we cannot become the illusion that peace, stability and prosperity in southeastern Europe are achieved without a previous study of the issues that raise the major problems we try to eliminate, and I refer to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, to the need to compromise Serbia in the process of reconciliation of the region and why not?A new discussion about the relations between the European Union, NATO and the United Nations, within the framework of that new balance that must be found between humanitarian interference and state sovereignty, which in my opinion must bring a modification of the United Nations letter itself.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the Kosovo War has worsened everything.That applies safely, and above all, to the relationship between the European Union and the Western Balkans.Many hopes have been raised since then.That is applicable both there and here.There because - we like it or not - in addition to the question of direct aid, the question is: what does Europe intend to do with us?Do you have admission in perspective?It is something that is said a lot in all these countries.But also here, in the European Union, high hopes have been raised.If we do well, it will be the first proof of a true foreign and security policy, will the European Union be able to act together for the first time and develop a joint policy for such a complicated agreement?Likewise, the question is whether the European Union has learned the lesson after the bad experiences of Bosnia in relation to the best assistance and experiences of Kosovo can we improve it, based on the experiences in Macedonia and four other countries?Given this scenario of very high hope, I think I do not exaggerate if I say that this first step, the stabilization and association agreement with Macedonia, has a crucial importance.It is not the only contribution of the Union.Next, we have the debate on the stability pact, on the face program and short -term financing.Now we discuss stability and association agreements, that is, the medium term perspective.	es
"The season risks going to loss and giving rise to a very serious crisis at the end of the year.It was therefore fully justified that Parliament developed a new resolution to which our group has provided an extremely important contribution, a resolution that emphasizes on some points considered absolutely essential by those who operate on the field.First of all, those who pollute must take all their responsibilities.Our resolution therefore asks for the application of two principles: in the first place, that of the ""pollutes cleans"", because it is not admissible that the reclamation of the coasts polluted by a load of hydrocarbons will not be carried out at the expense of the load owner, but at the expense of public bodies, namely taxpayers or, to say better, the victims.Secondly, there is the principle of ""who pollutes"".Its responsibility, specifies our resolution, must extend to the sectors and companies in the fishing sector, marine culture and aquaculture.This aspect is essential and means that anyone who pollutes cannot pretend to limit the amount of compensation for victims based on the roof set by the fipp due to the kind concession of large oil companies.If the roof of the fipol is insufficient, if it is clearly underestimated, it is necessary to raise it.Well, our resolution requires it.If the increase is insufficient, those who have polluted will have to finance the rest.It would be particularly unfair to allow an oil company, whose profits this year are around ten billion francs, denying complete compensation to the victims, whose vast majority consists of small companies and employees.The populations tried, Mr. Commissioner, expect concrete signs of solidarity at European level.Our resolution asks the commission to adopt the necessary measures to contribute to the repair of the damage inflicted on the fishing sector, affected by the consequences of the catastrophe.Blue Europe, PCP, must today show that, beyond the constraints it imposes on fishermen, solidarity is not an unknown feeling and the European Union must also participate in the environmental recovery of the wetlands and the affected coastal areas, whose biological value affects the union as a whole.Commissioner Fischler has just affirmed that he would welcome France's requests and please me.In the fundamental chapter of marine pollution, we must play a spur role.Twenty years after the catastrophe of the Amoco Cadiz, in Europe in the field of maritime security they continue to reign undisturbed laxism and irresponsibility, with the repercussions that derive from it, that is, the repetition of black tides.This time we must not let the inertia have the better.We must quickly define a general framework on maritime safety in compliance with the principle of subsidiarity and we must finally put an end to this infernal spiral of generalized irresponsibility.Mr. President, the economy of the western Atlantic is disastrous, contaminated by the Erika Nafta.Fishermen, oystercolors, mollusch growers, tourism operators, local and territorial authorities are frozen in waiting for aid and a treatment of the wreck which, as they tell us, continues to cause escape and constitutes a real delayed burst bomb."	it
Mr. President, the question asked by Mr. Karamanou is an extremely serious question, it must be said.We are fully aware of the humanitarian situation, difficult and dramatic, of Kosovo as well as from the problem of people displaced in the region, which come from Kosovo, with the repercussions that this leads in particular to the health of children and mortality rates.It is obvious to me that the European Union has clearly contributed to the efforts of humanitarian aid in the international community.As you know, the European Community has brought a total of 378 million euros only to the province of Kosovo, to which the national contributions of the various Member States must be added.This contribution covers various projects in the fields of health and the health system, as well as in that of water sanitation.In addition, as you know, the European Union makes a contribution to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which amounted to 66.3 million euros in 1999. I think that the honorable deputy knows that given the necessary division of labor between international donors, the health sector in Kosovo returns to the World Health Organization.This organization is fully aware, according to the reports it has written, of the alarming situation concerning the health of children.She focused her efforts on improving basic conditions in maternity and hospitals.However, we are aware that this situation is far from being satisfactorily resolved;that it has a dynamic and a dimension which also affects other areas of health, which is more of the health of children.It is a situation of a political nature, it is not a simply technical situation, it concerns the solution of the political situation because there are dimensions here, which should not be hidden, which are reflected according to what is, until today, the inability of the international community to put into practice the functioning of a multi -thnical society in Kosovo, which has had harmful effects on the improvement of the health system in this region.Thank you, Mr. Chairman of the Council, for your answer which completes the remarks that he said yesterday on the subject of Commissioner Patten.However, Mr. President, the amount of 378 million euros, which you say he was allocated in 1999, proved to be completely insufficient for the creation of elementary human conditions in Kosovo, in particular with regard to the granting of health services.Do you not think, Mr. Chairman of the Council, that the mere fact that infantile mortality has increased constitutes for the European continent a withered, a shame which should all mobilize us, so that the aid that we bring is more effective and generous?Admittedly, the situation was not idyllic before the bombings, so much need, but it has been very clearly degraded since NATO intervention with regard to the natural environment and the human environment.Under these conditions, Mr. Chairman of the Council, is it not a question of moral order to strive to create human conditions for the residents so proven in Kosovo, and especially to hold all the promises we have made?	fr
"And if we let a group of high -level officials act as a node for exchanges of experiences for the coordination and evaluation of social policy and the labor market, we will not be able to learn.The communication of the Commission, of which we discuss today, and which constituted the starting point for the Council's decision in November, provides a balanced exposure that explains how we can have a more qualified debate, as we can know more about the challenges with which the member countries will compare in the social policy sector in the coming years, years in which we will have populations who age and we will feel the effects of expansion.We already have today great social problems and high social expenses that weigh on public budgets, which for many member countries constitutes a problem.If the reforms are not started, we risk eroding the economic basis of social policy, and a strong and competitive economy is certainly the safest basis for good social protection.It is therefore reasonable to insert these themes in the agenda.In the debate on the coordination of social policy within the European Union, we often use the expression ""social convergence"".We liberals can be favorable to the concept of social convergence when it comes to defining, within the European Union, large common objectives that countries try to achieve through national social policy.It is therefore not a question of harmonization, but of common objectives.It is a fact: the countries of the European Union have different ways of organizing social policy.We have different traditions, there are cultural differences and, despite many points in common, there are between one country and the other also great differences in the nature of social problems and in their reach.For this, it is important to underline that social policy constitutes a question of national competence.National policy cannot naturally be subtracted from a series of common references that concern minimum social rights, established in the treaty, the guarantee of the free movement of labor without loss of its social rights, respect for the need to coordinate economies and respect for economic cooperation.Coordination and cooperation are therefore necessary.Convergence, however, must be an end and not a means.I also wish to thank the speaker, honorable Jan Andersson, for his very constructive commitment aimed at trying to reconcile different positions and ensure support for his relationship.I support the relationship.However, there are some points on which I do not completely agree.I do not agree with the request by virtue of which the Commission should intervene against what is called unfair competition between social and tax systems, if this intervention must be used to curb the new ideas, the development and improvement of the efficiency of our social systems, or to hinder the reduction of too high a tax burden in many member countries of the European Union.I am skeptical regarding the detailed regulation to which the commission could be reached against the scope and quality of childhood assistance and the elderly, as they are skeptical regarding the advantage of a common poverty threshold."	it
This does not interest the large groups of this Parliament, nor the major part of the unions, which in theory have in the defense of the European public service but which, in practice, focus on the corporate protection of their own registrants, using in questionable way the great powers which are granted to them.Union representatives are part of the disciplinary council and the status committee, so that the unfaithful civil servant risks nothing and to freeze the status.Union representatives are also part, and it is incomprehensible, juries of competition, and I would not be surprised if members of the union were already part of the Olaf, which would seriously harm this institution which should, at least formally, offer the guarantee of being super parts.So I understand why we meet at this hour, which is usually intended for other activities and not for debate, confrontation and information.Mr. President, when it comes to internal reform, the European Commission is in embarrassment.After the cases that prompted the previous commission to resign, the expectations are enormous.I sometimes have the impression that the proposals made within this assembly are all the more applauded as they are radical.On the other hand, the circumstances cannot be modified by a pen of the day overnight.As soon as it is a question of putting things to work, as soon as we must discuss on a few points of detail, we quickly see the difficulties arise.This is undoubtedly the reason why the budget control commission had to face more difficulties than expected on this point.However, we do not have to be ashamed of the result as it presents itself to you today.On this occasion, I would like to thank the colleague Van Hulten for the work he has accomplished on this report.If this report manages not to be once again watered down by the adoption of several amendments, it will make it possible to send the Commission for clear instructions and without detours on several determining points.Let's start with the most important education.We do not want to remove financial control.The financial controller must still have the possibility of doing his job before payments are done, not in all circumstances but in cases where uncertainties and risks exist.The Commission is launching a bad signal when it renames the Directorate General for Financial Control in general audit direction.The commission organization chart can easily be changed, but the task becomes more difficult when it is necessary to stick to the laws and, in this specific case, to the financial regulations.I did not carry out an exhaustive census, but the financial regulations of the community and the execution provisions which relate to it evoke in more hundred different passages the financial controller, its independence and the tasks assigned to it.These regulations cannot be ignored or bypassed, not even via a so-called soft law, as evoked by a colleague during a session in committee.	fr
It is obvious that some presidents do not pay attention to the hand signal, but immediately turn to the electronic voting system.I wonder if this is the correct approach.I know it takes longer, but shouldn't we in any case vote in any case with a hand signal?I assure you, awester colleague, that I will pay very close attention to how many hands get up.I hope that this is many at the time of the vote.Proposal for a guideline of the European Parliament and the Council on the adjustment of the legal provisions of the Member States on the labeling and presentation of food as well as the advertising for this (Kodified version) (KOM (1999) 0113 - C4-0212/1999/0090 (COD)) (Committee on Law and Inland Market) (Parliament accepts the commission.Proposal for a regulation (EC, Euratom) of the Council for the implementation of the decision 94/728/EC, Euratom on the system of own funds of the communities (Kodified version) (KOM (1997) 0652 - C4-0018/98 - 1997/0352 (CNS)) (Committee on Law and Innenmarkt) (the parliament is proposed by the Commission.)(A5-0106/1999) by Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna on behalf of the fishing committee on the proposal for a prescription for the Council on the conclusion of the protocol to determine the catch options and the financial consideration according to the agreement between the European community and the government of the Democratic Republicfor the period from June 1, 1999 to May 31, 2002 (KOM (1999) 0550 - C5-0305/1999 - 1999/0228 (CNS)) (Parliament accepts the draft of legislative resolution.)

The environment is in a very, very serious condition.As I think, I would also like to respond to the economic problem and the financing of projects that, in my opinion, should be consistently in the public interest.To finance: 613 million euros are not enough, Ms. Commissioner.850 million euros are also not sufficient.At the end of August I took part in a meeting of the committee for environmental issues, public health and consumer policy, where even 2 million euros, which corresponds to 4,000 billion lire, for the removal or at least containment of the problem of nicotine addiction.Nevertheless, the environment is a much more serious, much more important problem than nicotine addiction.I assure you, Ms. Commissioner, 850 million euros - provided that this financial framework is actually approved - are not sufficient to advance any start of project in practice.In many places, protected areas have been set up that are a particularly important component of the Life program.But protected areas that with scarce financial means, i.e.h.Without signage, being set up are ineffective and pointless.Hence my request to Parliament and the Commission to pay great attention to this question.President, Dear MPs!Since the beginning of 1999 there have been talks between the individual organs about the proposed regulation for a third phase of the financing instrument for the environment.I would like to thank the environmental committee and Ms. Lienemann again for the good and constructive cooperation on this matter.As a result, I can say that the commission in principle is in good spirits nine of the fourteen proposals in the environment.The Commission primarily welcomes the amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, to the committee proceedings.In this case, the parliament reacted to the commission's objections to a common point of view.In principle, the Commission can also accept amendment 4, which should appear in the text in another place.As for change applications 5 and 6, I would like to emphasize that the projects for the sustainable management of groundwater and surface waters as well as the projects for reducing climate -relevant air pollutants are highly contained in life.However, the Commission is of the opinion that its separate performance is opposed to the original decision to concentrate the proposal on a few areas that are given priority.There is also a risk of overlap with other community campaign programs, such as the fifth supporting program for research, technological development and demonstration.The central measures of this program - water quality, city of the future and innovative products and processes - sometimes refer to the same questions.Regarding the budget question, I am happy about the trust shown by the environmental committee.A larger financial framework is required in amendment application than proposed in the common point of view.I am also convinced of Life's great potential.This instrument should be able to finance good projects with a larger amount than the proposed financial framework.However, the amount listed in amendment 12 does not match the budget set on the basis of Agenda 2000.Also let me mention that an extended financial framework also places higher demands on the direction of the environment, which then has to look after a larger number of projects.In addition, other programs must also be taken into account that is decided in the context of the co -decision process.	de
"However, I would conclude by asking: What will be the first to arrive?Can we really reach full employment without freeing that business talent?If we wait for this to happen, I fear that the great objectives that you have presented before us will not be achieved.Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, I believe that the Summit of Lisbon, thanks to its effort and that of the Commission, can finally become an ambitious and social summit in which the European social model is finally seen as a new engine for the integration of Europe and in which full employment can become a specific objective.But if Lisbon wants to become the summit of those political ambitions, then Lisbon also has to become the summit of the methodology.I would like to ask you to pay attention to three points that seem of an essential importance to make this summit an important social summit.First, methodologically, the job creation strategy and the new social security coordination procedure cannot be subject to a macroeconomic policy that is only focused on stability.This clearly means for me, Mr. President of the Council, that the Council of Social Affairs should have the same weight as the Ecofin Council and that the political direction must continue to be in the hands of the same European Council.Secondly, I would like to strongly support your commitment to set clear objectives, both with respect to economic growth and in terms of job creation.But I would like to add that, if Lisbon wants to be a really social summit, we should be able to specify what we want to do to modernize and strengthen social security.Also in this matter we need some ""standards of excellence"".Also in this area we would like to have a process of Luxembourg.As an end point, support the ambition of the European Commission to formulate poverty norms and drastically reduce poverty within ten years.It seems important that objectives are raised in this regard, Mr. President of the Council, that is, we must stimulate all member states to fight against the social exclusion of citizens, not only of children but also of their parents and the elderly.I wish the presidency of the Council to carry out your ambitions.Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. President, the Extraordinary European Council of Lisbon on employment, economic reform and social cohesion, as they have told us, an ambitious, very ambitious objective, at the risk of disappointing our fellow citizens, very aware that it is not enough to decree the full employment and eradication of poverty in Europe to achieve it.But after all, that summit has a great merit: to draw, after Cardiff and Luxembourg, a political will for the benefit of a greater social cohesion, and in particular of the 57 million people who live in a situation of poverty in our territory, among which isolated mothers, large families and children to whom they will add, tomorrow, others excluded, to know those and those who will not have access to the new fields of new fields.knowledge, which will generate new social imbalances."	es
All of this corresponds to the principles that we have always defended.Thank you very much, Mr. Segni, I would like to do that.This is in the spirit of the position that we have always represented as a parliament.Mrs. President!I would like to draw your attention to a case with which this parliament has repeatedly dealt with.That is the case of Alexander Nikitin.We are all pleased here that the court has acquitted it and made it clear that access to environmental information in Russia is also a constitutional right.Now it is the case that he should be charged again because the prosecutor is in appeal.We know and we have found it in really many decisions - especially during the last plenary conference of the past year - that this is not just a legal case and that it is wrong to accuse Alexander Nikitin Nikitin crime and betrayal because we, as those affected, have a benefit from his results.These results are the basis for the European programs to protect the Barentsee, and that's why I ask you to examine a draft letter that describes the most important facts for you and make this position clear in the sense of the decisions of the parliament in Russia.Ms. Schroedter, I am happy to check the related facts if you have your letter.Ms. President, first of all, thank you for having a say and now the range of television programs in our offices is actually enormously expanded in the first period of the new year.Nevertheless, Ms. President, my wish was not met.We can now receive two Finnish and one Portuguese, but still no Dutch broadcaster.However, I had asked you for a Dutch program, because we Dutch, too, would like to follow the news if we are sent here every month.So I would like to ask you again to ensure that a Dutch broadcaster is also fed in.Ms. Plooij-van Gorsel, I can tell you that this point is on the agenda of the Quärtors on Wednesday.I hope that you will be decided there in your sense.Ms. President, can you tell me why this parliament does not adhere to the occupational safety regulations that it has said goodbye?Why hasn't the air quality in this building have been checked once?Why hasn't the occupational safety committee come together since 1998?Why did a fire protection exercise not take place in the Brussels or in the Strasbourg parliament building?Why don't fire protection instructions take place?Why was nothing done after my accident to make the stairs safer?Why is the smoking ban not enforced in the non -smoking zones?It is a shame that we say goodbye to the rules that we do not stick to ourselves.Ms. Lynne, you are absolutely right and I will check whether all of this is really that way.I will also submit the question to the Quärtors.I am sure that this great emphasis attaches great importance to the legal provisions that we say goodbye to ourselves.Mrs. President!Ms. Díez González and I had made some inquiries about the vice president, Ms. de Palacio, which was reproduced in a Spanish newspaper.	de
A5- 0028/2000, presented by the Honorable Decourrière on behalf of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, on the communication of the Commission (com (99) 0479 - C5-0243/99 - 1999/2178 (COS)) to the Member States that sets the guidelines for a community initiative concerning the transe -European cooperation and destined to encourage a harmonious developmentBalanced of the European territory (Interreg), A5-0024/2000, presented by the honorable Procacci on behalf of the Commission for Agriculture and Rural Development, on the Commission's communication project (com (99) 0475 - C5-0259/99 - 1999/2185 (COS)) to the Member States bearing the orientations for the Community initiative on rural development (leader +),A5-0034/2000, presented by Honorable Stenzel on behalf of the Commission for Employment and Social Affairs, on the Commission's communication project (COM (99) 0476 - C5-0260/99 - 1999/2186 (COS)) to the Member States that establishes the guidelines relating to Community initiative programs (PIC) for which the Member States are invited to present proposals in the context of the contribution of the contribution of the contribution of the contribution of the contributionEqual initiative.Since the honorable McCarthy is slightly late because of the late arrival of his plane, I propose to listen first to the honorable Decourrière.Mrs. President, honorable deputies, commissioners and members of the Commission for Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, I was commissioned to draw up the European Parliament report on the Interreg III Community initiative program.In the parliamentary commission we have examined more than one hundred amendments and so far 17 have been re -proposed, some of which already presented in the commission.Before moving on to the discussion of the content of the resolution I propose, I wish to make you know the elements I took into consideration and that have guided my work as a speaker.First of all, I would like to remind you of the role of the Interreg Community initiative, founded on the principle of transnationality and innovation.This program constitutes a European development and size engine.Interreg is part of the four community initiatives scheduled for the period 2000-2006 and will have the most consistent financial package, i.e. 4,875 billion euros against the current 3,604 billion.Created in 1990, the Interreg initiative finds its prerequisite in the desire to prepare the European regions for Europe without borders in the field of the realization of the large single market.With the reform of the structural funds of 1994 and 1996, the Pic Interreg introduced new elements that contribute to the development of the transe European networks of transport and energy distribution.These programs have encouraged cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation of the European Union by favoring a balanced development of the community space.The Interreg III program, of which the European Commission submit the guidelines to our exam, in accordance with the provisions of Regulation n.1260/1999 of the European Community concerning the general provisions on structural funds, pursues this objective.It is based on three elements: the element to which organizes cross -border cooperation between the local authorities of the internal and external front -frontal regions of the European Union starting from common development strategies, whose implementation falls within the responsibilities of local and regional member states and authorities;The B that provides for transnational cooperation between the national, regional and local authorities in several Member States or countries candidates for adhesion to the European Union on territorial structure, transport and environment networks;The realization of this element falls under the responsibility of the Member States and the national authorities;and the CE In intended to organize interregional cooperation between different regions of the Member States or third countries for the insertion of the experiences on elements A and B on the network as well as cooperation in the research, technological development sector, aspect that must be defined with the European Commission in charge of its implementation.	it
"Member States must act promptly and firmly.Our governments must put together financial resources to guarantee effective controls and must stop dragging each initiative on maritime safety for long.The tragedy of Erika did not have a cost in terms of human lives, but could have destroyed the existence of many, such as the Sea Empress or the Braer.What is certain is that all three accidents caused an ecological disaster.My group is solidarity with the inhabitants of Brittany, whose region was devastated by the disaster, just as on other occasions we were solidarity with the inhabitants of Western Wales and the Shetland islands.It would be time to stop manifesting our solidarity and instead begin to release mandatory mandates to eliminate these ships of shame in favor of safe seas, otherwise, during the year we will find ourselves again discussing a new resolution proposal for the sinking of another cistern ship charging the convenient flag that infesters the sea of ​​crude.The time of resolutions has passed: now it's the time to act.Unfortunately, I fear that the advice will also remain inactive this time and we will return to the future to discuss a new maritime and ecological disaster.Mr. President, every time there is a disaster like this is said that he must never repeat himself again.In reality we cannot prevent accidents at sea, but it is our duty to learn from any accident like this and put into practice the lessons learned to reduce future risks.The Erika accident was serious above all for the inhabitants of Brittany more directly affected, but had devastating effects on the wildlife of most of Europe.According to some sources, there would be the worst disaster that the birds of this European region has ever hit;According to the Royal Society for the protection of birds, at least 400,000 birds may have died, probably mostly Urie.How much tragedy and how much anguish in the images of the black oil birds deposited on the beaches by the veterinarians, which we have seen.We all want the best rules for ships, regardless of their flag.The regulations must be respected, such as the ""polluting pays"" principle, so as to use the penalties and incentives to exercise pressure on maritime operators and oil companies and ensure that the best practices are introduced.I share every word of the commissioner lady, but the problem is how long it will take why measures of the type they proposed are introduced.As a politician, Mrs. Commissioner must remind her officials how difficult it would be forced to recur in the classroom in a year, on the occasion of a similar accident, equally devastating, if some of the measures proposed today were still only beautiful words, having not had the opportunity to put them into practice.The idea of ​​another similar accident in the future should act as a perfect catalyst for the commissioner and for his officials."	it
This assembly will face one of the most important imperatives that can result from the essential measures adopted so that the commission's resources are up to their tasks.Last month, as Romano Prodi just said, we started a complete evaluation of the activities and resources of the entire commission and in September we will inform in detail about it.Our objective is to focus the work of the Commission on essential priorities in the field of policy formulation and basic activities, in line with our strategic objectives in the field of policy formulation for the next five years.Inevitably, that will entail the determination of activities that could be and should be reduced or concluded.It involves a very strict examination of how the use of external and internal resources can be balanced in the most effective way.It entails the assignment of personnel to sectors of great importance in the field of policy formulation in the departments and throughout the Commission.And, when this assignment has been met, we can determine if the resources we have at the height of the tasks entrusted to us.If it is shown that they are not, we will raise the question of increasing resources to the budgetary authority.If you do not receive a positive response, you will have to address the difficult question of deciding those of our less priority activities that must be suspended.The commission should not only do it, but also this Parliament and the Council.I do not formulate this observation because the Commission Prodi coats the slightest desire to give up activities or committed.On the contrary, as many deputies to this assembly understand, I expose these considerations, because we want to comply with our tasks in the most effective and responsible way.That means filling any important lag between obligations and operating resources by reducing activities or increasing the media or through a combination of both.In each of the three pillars of the reform, the active support and cooperation of this assembly will be absolutely decisive.The new activities based on activities, which the president has just mentioned, will link for the first time the political priorities with the availability of resources and, consequently, with the budget.Thus, the role of the budgetary authority in the functioning of the management based on the activities will be decisive.It is evident that attempts to manage the activities of the Commission on a small scale would not result in anyone's benefit.Thus, a solid and practical inter -institutional agreement will be a prerequisite for the efficient operation of activities based on activities.In the human resources policy, the participation of Parliament will have to inevitably be that of an employer of officials and that of a democratic institution before which the commission must account.That will also be a very arduous imperative.And, finally, in the decisive sector of financial management, in which the Court of Accounts, the Committee of Independent Experts and other external and internal analyzes have strongly advised real changes, the support of this Assembly for the application of the recommendations for money to pay as much as possible without security for security will cover primary importance.In the limited time that I have for this statement, it is impossible, obviously, to expose our proposals in greater detail.	es
It is a great danger and it must be ensured that in Europe all regions can participate in the Society of Knowledge and that no one remains excluded.Europe will have to be able more than in the past to draw from the realities of its regions to optimally exploit the strength of these regions in favor of creativity and to reach a more realistic employment policy.We had to see that despite all the means allocated by way of structural funds, there are still major differences in unemployment rates.I therefore ask that networks are established between the regions and that the idea of ​​a Europe in which each Member State thinks for themselves are abandoned.Mr. President, Mr. Prime Minister Guterres, president of Prodi, honorable colleagues, judged positive and approaches that the Portuguese commission and presidency have proclaimed full employment as the objective of European politics.I agree, but a sustainable model of full employment contemplates in the first place qualified jobs and covered by social protection.We must modify the world of economy and work in order to make the remunerated work activity ecologically sustainable.They focus primarily on further reforms for deregulating the economy in the internal market, on the internet revolution, trade and electronic transactions as machines to create jobs.With these policies they will not be able to keep faith with the promise of full employment.Economic reforms such as the liberalization of the energy market of energy have generated strong competition and numerous mergers, with consequent destruction of jobs, and this trend is still underway.Already in the mid -nineties, Commissioner Bangemann had promised a huge growth of employment thanks to the information society.The result we face is disappointing.The growth recorded in sectors such as that of the media, mobile telephony and software has not been able to compensate for the loss of places in the telecommunications sector and in the electronic industry as well as the effects of the rationalizations deriving from computer technologies in other sectors of the economy.And it certainly does not increase my optimism to see many electronic commerce companies record a gigantic capitalization on the stock exchange, while on an operational level they continue to work at a loss.It is established that trade and electronic transactions will generally have a great future;But their contribution to the growth of employment is exaggerated by their protagonists in almost mystical terms.That's why I am convinced that for a new policy of full employment there is a different policy mix.A less rigid monetary policy, a budgetary policy that strengthens investments for expansion and future, a wage policy linked to productivity that stimulates the European internal demand and the growth of employment, is needed.We serve secondly a drastic reduction strategy of working hours and redistribution of work between women and men.Thirdly, the employment encouraged by public transport in ecocompatible economic sectors and a parallel innovation policy that looks to the future and aims in particular to consolidate small and medium -sized enterprises must be enhanced by public transport.Fourth, a policy of emancipation of the labor market is needed, which clearly refers to the strategies aimed at creating underpaid work categories and compulsory work patterns for unqualified tasks, because only with a wide -ranging offense will we be able to create a sufficient basis for a qualified workforce for the knowledge society, for environmentally friendly social and cultural services.	it
"I think it is also right to recognize the efforts that the high representative Solana is carrying out in order to have a more effective, more visible and more consistent common foreign policy with the European Union.In this sense, I agree with the interventions made by some colleagues who preceded me according to which it is necessary to have a global policy that integrates not only military aspects, but also civil, diplomatic, humanitarian and police elements, to which the high representative Solana referred.The Portuguese presidency has made significant steps forward, actually, creating a series of organs with a provisional or temporary nature.In record time, he organized this informal advice of the defense ministers and reported a whole series of objectives to be achieved during the long journey towards this foreign and common security policy.One of these was the advice of Sintra about which I would have questions to ask the high representative Solana.This advice was based on two documents: a British document concerning the headline Goals, dedicated to the priority objectives, and another document on the permanent military organs of the European Union.Mr. High Representative Solana, I would like to ask you if, on the occasion of the next commission for foreign affairs, the rights of man, the common security and the defense policy, you would be willing to explain to the members of said Commission B diffusely together with Commissioner Patten, to whom I formulate the same question, and with the President in charge of the Council, to which I ask you, Mr. Solana, to transmit this request - the content of the documents that were treated during the top.A second question, Mr. High Representative, would be to know to what extent she supports the observations and declarations made by the French Defense Minister, according to which the Member States must be destined for 0.7% of the gross domestic product for defense costs.I would like to know his opinion, if you share this point of view, if you consider a more decisive contribution from the Member States in this area really necessary.Thirdly, what is its evaluation of the ""Crisex 2000@, just ended, in which, for the first time, the European Union has shared a series of initiatives with NATO for the first time? In the quarter and last place, Mr. Solana, I would like to know if, in the event that the Member States asked him, he would be willing to preside over the political and defense committee by adding this charge to the whole experience that you currently have in the general secretary.of the Council of Ministers, as a high representative for the common foreign and security policy, as a secretary general of the Union of Western Europe and former secretary general of NATO.in Chechnya and in other parts of the world.For my part, I do not intend to exasperate it and today, as far as it concerns, I recognize her the efforts she made to build a European security and defense policy worthy of this name that did not have before.It is true that we are still far from the desired objective, or at least by the goal that I hope."	it
"We too are called into question by this democratic deficit.And it is for this reason that at the next day of the inauguration of the intergovernmental conference, during which I will have the honor of representing the commission next to the president Prodi and working, I repeat, in full agreement with your two representatives, the honorable Brok and Tsatsos, a little while ago, within the college, we decided to launch the ""dialogue for Europe and Europe"", to contribute to this direct contact with the citizens.All the commissioners, whenever they have to go to a country and not only that of origin, in a region - it happens to me three or four times a month - they have committed themselves to dedicating some of their time to a direct dialogue with citizens, not only with the elites or institutional managers who usually meet, to establish direct contact, in a university, a high school, a factory, to meet people, answer the questions.This will be the role that we will take on, as you will take on yours, compared to this indispensable initiative, compared to this pressing obligation aimed at reducing the democratic deficit, that is, the distance between how much we do and the citizens.We wish to carry out this initiative in collaboration with the Member States and in connection with the European Parliament.We will regularly present a synthesis, in order to feel the pulse of public opinion well and consequently carry out adjustments or impress new guidelines.We also want to carry out this initiative in concertation with national parliaments, the local elect, non -governmental organizations, socioprofessional environments and media.The opinion centers, groups and political parties, European and national parliamentarians, the elected representatives, as I just said, of local authorities or national parliaments, the committee of the regions, the economic and social committee, the organizations of civil society and university environments will be involved.I remember among the other - if there was ever need - that, on 1 February last, the European Parliament itself has already taken the initiative, for which I thank President Napolitano again, to organize a first work meeting with the representatives of the national parliaments, or the representatives of the citizens of each state.The Commission will propose to the Member States to associate with this operation in the framework of a punctual cooperation or in the field of a more structured partnership.We will activate a plan for the means of communication and close contacts with the Presidency of the Union and the European Parliament.I have already explained the methods of the contribution of the commissioners during the meetings and on site visits in practice we want to organize civic debates.I simply allow me, without wanting to give absolutely lessons nor advice, to remember that when I had the honor of being minister for European affairs in my country, I perceived this need to dialogue directly with citizens.Carrying out this dialogue directly every week in each region, I realized that there was an incredible need to give a face to the European Union.So, every week, I went to dialogue with them together with a commissioner, not necessarily a French commissioner, or to ambassadors stationed in Paris or European parliamentarians."	it
"These general remarks being made, I would like to concentrate my point, about Interreg, on your main remarks.The former are linked to the calendar and the content of this initiative.You say that the adoption of these guidelines was too late, and the risk of interruption of previous programs has been underlined, in particular by your rapporteur.It is true, I recognize it, and you know what are the reasons, ladies and gentlemen European deputies.There is a delay in the adoption of Interreg's orientations in March-April 2000. I recognize it, I take note like you.However, I observe that the Member States and the regions are already actively preparing the Interreg III programs and the orientation project was also distributed more than three months ago.I also observe that the eligibility of expenses will be admitted from the date of presentation of the programs and I confirm the possibility of retroactivity until January 1, if this program is presented before April 30.So much for the first remark.Second remark: Regarding the non -exhaustive list of eligible measures for component B, I want to tell you and confirm that I have asked the Commission to accept to include other specific themes, in particular in favor of small and medium -sized enterprises or cultural heritage, in the list of actions eligible for component B and therefore no longer consider this list as exhaustive.Third point: interregional cooperation, the importance of component C. The Commission shares the observations that have been made by your assembly on the importance of this C section, of interregional cooperation.As your rapporteur wishes, I will send you detailed information on the implementation system of this component.Fourth note: the observatory and the possible use of a technical assistance office.As you asked, I decided to delete any reference to the use of a technical assistance office in the text, while waiting for the debate, in progress within the Commission, on the service outsourcing systems finds its outcome.But, ladies and gentlemen deputies, if we delete any reference and, later, any use of a bat, it has a consequence, which must be the increase in certain officials of civil servants to do this work, because someone will have to do it and I will not be able to redeploy the same personnel indefinitely, even though our tasks increase with ISPA and with the concern to better control, with rigor and transparencyCommunity credits, for which I have the charge, often in partnership or in co -responsibility with the Member States.Now being the implementation of Interreg, a subject that has been mentioned by many of you, and the possible eligibility for component A, ""cross -border cooperation"", actions in the Adriatic, for Sicily or for the UlTrapipheral regions, the Commission, ladies and Gentlemen, understands your concerns and hears your request on these different points.So I intend to modify the guidelines to integrate into the transnational component B a specific priority: ""Integrated cooperation of maritime and island regions"", so as to cover, in order, it seems to me, appropriate, the different possibilities of cooperation between these regions."	fr
At the moment, it is evident that the first priority corresponds to rescue helicopters and then must continue with food aid and other emergency aid.After three weeks since these floods began, finally the entire world has begun to wake up and realize the situation, which claims to heaven, in which Mozambique lives: there are thousands of people whose life hangs from a thread and that, if we do not have the sending of means of transport, especially aerial, to take them out of the situation in which they are, they will quickly die.That is undoubtedly the most priority issue at this time: Transport for salvation and emergency humanitarian aid, including food aid.But I would like to underline that the European Union and the rest of the world cannot limit their help to Mozambique to this issue of emergency that we are talking about.We must be aware of the ravages resulting from floods.Therefore, it is urgent to start thinking about finding financial support for the reconstitution of infrastructure that have been destroyed and without which Mozambique could not continue its path to the development he had started some years ago and so promisingly.That question of the reconstruction of infrastructure is fundamental, without that there is no development, and it is also time for some Mozambique creditors to think of forgiving or lowering their debts.If nothing is done now, we will spoil all the effort made in the past to help Mozambique in their development.Therefore, I hope that the visit to Mozambique that Commissioner Nielson and the representatives of the Portuguese Presidency of the European Union have made this week properly to raise that very important issue.Mr. President, it has already been said that Mozambique, after a war that plunged the country into misery, is now before a natural catastrophe of terrifying dimensions.Without being calculated at the moment, how many people have died, it is known that about 80,000 are imminent of drowned and that 300,000 have lost their homes and their cultivation fields.They urgently need help for survival, food, water and shelters.Then the needs of medicines will come to avoid epidemics, which already seems that they have begun, and the means for reconstruction.But the immediate need for immediate need comes in spite of the efforts of the NGOs, as roads, bridges and rail lines are cut.Helicopters are necessary.There are only five, apparently, to get off the trees to 80,000 people.But the machinery that mobilizes help is too heavy.The socialist group of this Parliament has promoted the prevention of natural catastrophes - even has defended conflict prevention - as the best means to avoid situations such as the one now suffers from the population of Mozambique.I want to remember, particularly, the efforts of deputy Michel Rocard, of the previous legislature.The European Commission has responded, already in 1994, a program for the prevention of catastrophes -Dítcho- that intended to be proactive and, from a regional approach, avoid catastrophes or, in any case, minimize its effects on populations.	es
The policy of the European Union must regain the trust of citizens, who claim the right to access the institutions quickly and without preclusions and ask that the rules on which their understanding depends are legible.They want a policy destined to succeed, which they consider as a normal service rendered to responsible citizens.The success of the reform essentially depends on the Commission's initiative.However, I am irritated by the declaration issued today by the executive, according to which the discussion of the intermediate relationship with the Parliament must only have an informal character.Commissioner Kinnock, his intervention on Tuesday next to the budget control commission, however, cannot be one -way, because Parliament wants and must contribute to the reforms.This week's press conference also offends my political sensitivity because it is held before an accurate discussion of the proposal within the Commission for the budget control.Commissioner Kinnock, despite his personal successes it seems to me that the commission must still take a long journey before being able to satisfy our strong, but legitimate expectations.I wish to start by putting to the documents and making the honorable Langenhagen that the decision that I do not intervene at tomorrow's plenary session and therefore is not available to provide formal responses on the relationship is not mine or the commission, but it is a decision of Parliament.So, if he wants to make a paternal, it is better that he does it here in the classroom. The honorable knows me well enough to know that in all the phases of these five years, in which we worked together in Parliament, there was not only one time when I refused to make account complete, formal and detailedly of my work.Mr. President, I would like to start paying tribute to conscientious work and, from what I feel, generous of the honorable Van Hulten in preparing this relationship.Although new of this classroom, he is quite old in some respects, certainly as regards his familiarity with the institutions since he is a former official;I believe that he has shown this quality by skillfully facing a complex theme and of the utmost importance for all our institutions, as various parliamentarians have underlined.I thank him and wish him a long and brilliant career as a deputy.Mr. President, as you will know, the report of the honorable Van Hulten on the second report of the Committee of independent experts is necessarily long and, since I intend to answer in particular in particular on issues relating to management and financial control, I ask you to be indulgent.Of course I will not steal at the classroom more time than it is absolutely necessary.When the Assembly examined the second report of the Committee of Independent Experts last September, on behalf of the Entrance Commission I promised that the report would be considered a fundamental element in the Commission's reform proposals.Our efforts, aimed at keeping this promise, will be evident for Parliament when the package of reforms that the Commission approved today, well within the term we had set ourselves four months ago, will be examined.	it
Negotiations in Austria for the Constitution of the Government The agenda calls for the debate on negotiations in Austria with a view to the government's constitution.I immediately give the floor to the President in office of the Council.Madam President, the Chairman of the Commission, Mr. Chairman in office of the Council, the group of the Party of European Socialists wishes to send three messages to European public opinion today.Whether it is clear: we are deeply united with regard to these three messages.First, we want to specify that we fully support the declaration of the presidency in the exercise of the Council and the 14 Member States and that we identify ourselves, because it responds to the community of values ​​which was built by all of us, and not by a single political force.Anyway, it is a community of values ​​which is contrary to that defends by this party, which has ironically baptized freedom of freedom.The Europe that we currently build is precisely the result of bitter experiences that we have all suffered and the socialist group condemns the insults addressed to the President of the French Republic and to the Belgian government, but also to the socialists, also European citizens, because, ladies and gentlemen, the Austrian socialists are now accused of trahison to their homeland.I will tell you one thing: for many years, I betrayed my homeland, that's at least what General Franco said.President Guterres also betrayed Salazar.It seems necessary to me that the PPE affirms and defends it.In addition, I think that the Commission, Mr. Prodi, was a guardian of the treaties.But I remind the President Prodi that during the investiture debate, he spoke of the Commission as a European government.However, a government must have more nerve and courage.This is what I ask the Prode President for the moment.(Applause) Unless I owe to a commissioner as effective as Mr. Fischler, according to some rumors - it all depends on the language in which they are expressed -, President Prodi would have asked for the resignation of Mr. Fischler.I will be grateful to you to clarify this point in front of the Parliament.Second, Madam President, we want to send a very clear message to the Austrian people.A call for the majority of the Austrian people who did not vote to Haider, who voted for clearly democratic parties, engaged in the European project I would like to point out that if Mr. Schüssel was Minister of Finance, Chancellor Vranitzky also played a role in the integration process of Austria.In politics, you cannot show as much sectarianism.It is together that we allowed the entry of Austria into the community.It is the work of all and not of a single group.Consequently, Madam President, we believe that it is our right and our duty to ask Austrians to rethink their choice, this kind of plague which we have already suffered in Europe risking harming Austria, but also to expand, as history reminds us.	fr
This is not enough to make proposals from approximate data.What we need is an absolutely binding objective on the legal level for OSPAR.It is only thus that we will succeed in legal clarity and especially the possibility of acting in court.Everything else would have no effect and would not help prevent ecological disasters like the one we currently know in Romania and Hungary can also occur here.I find it unfortunate that national governments are not willing to commit to a legally binding protection, although they agreed on OSPAR at the international level.But I believe that this is precisely what we must repair here, in Parliament, in order to show that we do not tolerate that it is infringed with the credibility of our policy.It is also important to strengthen the principle of the polluter paying, because prices must tell the ecological truth.We cannot kneel before the interests of lobbies of the agricultural and chemical industry;Rather, we must proclaim and express by our vote that we want the principle of the Pollueur Payer and, in doing so, prices that cover costs.Water is our most important vital resource and we must watch, with our vote, to encourage and push for the real respect of the OSPAR Convention.It is possible with closed production cycles;Everything else would be an edulcoration of the directive.Let us enter this chance!Mr. President, during the short time I have, I want to salute the report and recall three principles, to which we must add everything else, which are clearly exposed in the amendments of the rapporteur: water is not a merchant good but a heritage belonging to the peoples of the Union;The final objective is to manage to eliminate all pollutants from surface water and groundwater;And it is necessary to inform the population so that they can participate in the recovery of water and that it does not consume it excess when it is such a precious good.I know that this directive can encounter problems because we have discussed here the different realities of the different countries of the Union.What is happening to the north is different from what's going on in the south and what's going on in countries with desertification problems.I know it.But some amendments are trying to help the countries of the South, more precisely amendment 43 which, when it speaks of recovery of costs, also indicates that the Member States will have to take into account the social and environmental conditions of the countries when making decisions.There are also difficulties in the field of transfers.In my country - I live in the north of Spain - there is a big difference between the North and the South, and these difficulties arise when it is necessary to transfer the water from one place to another.But Ms. Lienemann's report also says that receiving water pools must save and watch over their water.	fr
This public intervention is achievable and the decentralization of university education would certainly contribute to balance the development policy.Another point that we want to underline is instead linked to industrial policy.In the planning of the coordination of structural funds and cohesion funds, the Commission should have taken more into consideration the importance of the tertiary, electronic commerce and the spread of the use of the Internet.In the past, poverty and wealth depended above all on the structure of the local economic fabric.The regions with greater industrial presence were, in fact, considered rich.Today the situation is completely different, indeed we have come to the opposite, and these regions have impoverished.It is therefore important to invest in new sectors, in the so -called electronic and tertiary production, which represent the future.This, in my opinion, was almost ignored by the competent commission that prepared this report.The commission for industry, foreign trade, research and energy therefore urges the commission to pay more attention to this issue.Finally, as a commission for energy, we would have liked to see greater financial support for renewable energy resources through the use of structural funds and regional development funds.In this way, a greater use of renewable energy sources would have been promoted, compensating the insufficient funds of the energy development program..(En) Mr. President, my most lively thanks to the honorable Schroedter for the work done.I would like to explain to my colleagues that I intervene in place of the honorable Flautre, who followed this practice in the commission for employment and social affairs, but which unfortunately is not good.I would like to attract your attention to the amendments nos.1 and 2, approved in the commission for the employment he social affairs, but not a commission for regional policy, transport and tourism.These amendments deal with the social economy and the need to provide the share capital of risk and to give financial support to local initiatives aimed at creating jobs and strengthening social cohesion.In the past this parliament has recognized the large potential for creating the employment of the social economy.Therefore the aforementioned amendments match the position of the parliament according to which social exclusion is a serious problem that requires a constructive intervention.We hope that those who are thinking of voting against these amendments have very valid reasons to present to Parliament and citizens looking for work.In his report, the honorable Flautre also highlights a field in which there is a painful deficiency of coordination, of which instead there is a desperate need.The Commission's proposals refer to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five fields of action of the European Social Fund.The lack of specific directors here is felt with particular intensity, given that the idea of ​​connecting the aid of the social fund to the employment strategy will be carried out for the first time during the programming period 2000-2006.This omission makes it seem that the commission itself does not know in the least how to guarantee maximum coordination between the support for the European Social Fund, subject to revision after three and a half years, and the annual national action plans for the employment of the Member States.	it
"The fact reinforces the need to strengthen European Civil Protection, following the guidelines suggested by President Prodi in his recent speech and as one or two deputies have suggested today.But, for now, the priority is to overcome the crisis.As I said, my colleague, Commissioner Wallström, is today at the scene.She will inform Parliament in detail about the actions she will propose as a result of her visit.This has been a frightful tragedy for Europe and Europe must respond and do everything to ensure that facts such as this do not continue to ruin our future.The debate is closed.The vote will take place below.Voting(FR) The only reason we have voted in favor of the PSE-VETS/Ale-GG/NGL commitment resolution is that only this resolution allowed us to ""condemn the decision of the direction of Goodyear-Dunlop to close its factory in Italy.""However, the measures proposed in this resolution are insignificant to stop the policy of large industrial groups, which suppress jobs and sharpen unemployment.On the other hand, these are only words, since socialist governments, which are a majority in Europe, are as incapable as the right -wing governments to take the necessary measures to prevent dismissals.The real problem is not to find the legal procedures that make the process of dismissal more complex, but of prohibiting layoffs.The only way to stop this infernal mechanism - which, on the one hand, generates financial surplus value and, on the other, unemployment - consists in prohibiting layoffs in all large companies that obtain benefits, under penalty of expropriation, and in publishing the balances of large societies, and submitting them to control of their workers and the entire population.It is necessary that the company will have the means to impose on the large companies and their owners their own priorities, and in the first place the eradication of unemployment.The sums necessary to create useful jobs in public services, as well as to finance the distribution of work among all, without decrease in wages, must be obtained from the benefits of large companies.It is infinitely more important, for the majority of society, than waste in financial operations or the scandalous enrichment of a minority of great shareholders..(SV) I cannot give my support to this resolution, since in point 8 an industry determined in Italy is indicated with the desire that its facilities be maintained, at the same time that the current direction of the company that sells the factory to a European manufacturer of tires is advised.It is not a task that competes with the European Parliament to declare what factories in the fifteen countries of the European Union have to remain or disappear, expand or decrease their template of workers, stay in a place or move, sell or not sell and which must be sold, inside or outside Europe."	es
"President, everyone underlined it: Today is a very important day, the day of the first debate in the political life of Europe.And that's no coincidence.Today it is not about the relationship of Europe, our institutions to Austria or the party of Mr. Haider.I think today is about Europe itself, about its right to exist, the reasons why we are here in this parliament today.This parliament does not stand for money and goods.This parliament and the European institutions stand for values, morality and for a spirit.Now in the twentieth century we have had the experience that democracies can endanger this morality, these values ​​and this spirit with the names of fanatic nationalism, populism and racism.You only need to read Mr. Haider's program, the FPÖ.In every chapter you come across fanatical nationalism, populism and racism.I only quote a sentence that my friend Vidal-Quadra has already referred to: ""The concept of home is defined in spatial, ethnic and cultural terms, with regard to space, culture and breed."" And we cannot accept such explanations.If Europe should make sense and - forgive me if I tell my political friends - if Christian democracy makes sense, if the history of Christian democracy makes sense, then it must clearly and unmistakably differentiate itself from the statements of this program and refuse how many good reasons may also speak for an agreement with an organization of this kind.That is why I believe that the European Parliament, which is more independent in relation to its statements and actions, than the council or the Commission, the states and European institutions that had the courage to say no;To say what you, Ms. President, have explained in our name;An explanation that honors us and clearly and without wague expresses that we reject and condemn what is going on in Austria.We should remember what a great French Christian Democrat said on the day of the Munich Agreement: ""When it comes to saying no - preferably immediately."" (Applause) Mrs. President!We are worried.We, these are the Belgian Christian Democrats and fortunately also many other colleagues.The coalition, which is prepared in one of the Member States, is certainly an Austrian matter, but it also undeniably has a European dimension.Because what connects us in Europe are the values ​​and principles of freedom, democracy and respect for human rights in the first place.The chairman of the Freedom Party of Austria, Jörg Haider, has repeatedly expressed his disregard for these values.He also disregards the elementary forms of diplomatic courtesy.He is a dangerous man.The Christian Democratic parties in my country have decided for a long time and they remain: they take note of the protests of voters from extreme right, but never negotiate with leaders from extremely right.Values ​​must be higher than power."	de
Mr. President, it is true that the suspension or postponement sine die of conversations between Syrians and Israelis as well as the new bomb attack of the day before yesterday which caused 16 injured is not good news.It is clear that for once, the United States has failed to unlock the situation for these negotiations to resume.It is true that the obstacles are size: the Syrians aspire to have under their sovereignty and their jurisdiction again the platforms of the Golan and to recover the borders prior to June 4, 1967, while the Israelis wish, believing that this is better suitable for their situation, that the boundaries chosen are those fixed in 1923. The blocking of these conversations between Syrians and Israelis does not constitute the only delay thatknows the peace process in the Middle East.The application of the framework agreement between the Palestinian authority and Israel is currently suspended.Following the conversations that took place the day before yesterday between the Israeli Prime Minister and the head of the Palestinian Authority, the Israeli Prime Minister requested a postponement of two months from February 13, the deadline for the execution of the framework agreement relating to the situation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.What can the European Union do in the face of this situation?Unfortunately not much.It must logically support these negotiations, under the auspices of the United States and must multiply contacts.The presence of the envoy of the European Union, the ambassador Moratinos, who certainly fulfilled his mission with great diligence and efficiency in accordance with the powers available to the European Union, is positive.But all of this does not prevent us from seeing that we are relatively helpless, because when the two-part-parts negotiators take the plane this weekend to return to the United States, we cannot prevent ourselves from thinking that each time a hundred dollars are spent for the peace process in the region, 60 dollars are paid by the European Union.And when one thinks that a conference will soon be held in Moscow, the pathetic character of the presence of the European Union in this process is highlighted.I would like to emphasize the Portuguese presidency on the need we can play a more central role and that it is time to take over and assume an increased presence of the European Union.I hope that the next visit of the president of the European Parliament in the region as well as that of the presidents of the corresponding inter -parliamentary delegations, will mark the beginning of a period when the European Union will take more initiative and will be more present in this difficult and complex peace process.Mr. President, Mr. Chairman of the Council, Mr. Commissioner Patten, I would like to thank you for your interventions, in particular Mr. Patten, whose analysis I entirely share.That's why I don't have the intention of repeating what he said.I would simply like to make three remarks that Commissioner Patten will no doubt consider as similar to what he said, but who, for various reasons, can only be formulated so open than by a parliamentarian.	fr
I cannot help fully share this desire.As soon as this opinion is approved here, in Parliament, they will be submitted again to the Star Commission so that Member States can confirm their compliance, provisionally issued on November 14.I suppose the commission may approve in March/April the definitive version of the guidelines.And once published in the Official Gazette they will only mediate the months, specifically, six months, to present Leader+programs.I think it is important to mention one thing: the expenses made within the framework of the Leader+ are subsidable from the moment from which the program is in the hands of the commission.In those programs that are presented before April 30 of this year there is also the possibility of retroactively indicating January 1 as the beginning of subsidization.Finally, the resolution project contains under point 20 seven concrete amendments of the guidelines.After an attentive analysis I can tell you that the amendments contained in sections 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable to the commission and will be assumed.The amendment of section 6 is also partially accepted, since it insists that the deadline for the authorization of the programs within the framework of the Leader+ is a maximum of six months.The amendment of section 1 is no longer a objective, in our view, because as a consequence of the deliberations taken with the representatives of the Member States in the Commission-Star, this point was reformulated in the sense of the position of the Parliament.Therefore, only the amendment of section 3 remains.The commission cannot help joining this desire for modification because it responds exactly to what the commission itself originally formulated.However, I must add that for the Member States the cooperation of our action groups with similar groups from third countries has gone too far.Consequently, an amendment has been carried out in the Commission, but the Commission will now satisfy the desire of Parliament and thus present the guidelines.It will continue to fight for this to be acceptable to the Member States.I want to refer briefly to the 13 amendments that have been presented.Here the commission cannot accept three, specifically, amendments 3, 12 and 13. All others, can accept them in their entirety or in the sense of them.Mrs. President, ladies and lords, is an exceptional situation to speak today, in this legislature, about the Equal initiative in the European Parliament.Ultimately, and because of political changes in Austria, in Europe there is an ascending and increasing political restlessness;There are political statements and political dialogue.It is fair to point out that both Parliament and the Commission may present certain policies.Certain proposals not only about legislation but also on action plans related to the fight against discrimination, to the construction of free and fair communities.Thus, I will make a small mention about discriminations and take this opportunity to ask that the corresponding responsible commissions designate their speakers to advance such a package against discrimination as quickly as possible.	es
We also have to continue our support for economic reforms and social development in the entire Lebanon.A solution must be found for the problem of the Palestinian refugees;With almost five million people, this is the largest refugee group worldwide, and this shows what enormous challenges will be managed in the future.We have to support the initiatives through which the availability of the region's extremely scarce water resources increases and their distribution and management are improved.As the last, perhaps most important area, we promote closer regional cooperation in different areas and have to try to bring all affected countries to a table so that they are combined with combined forces to solve the common problems.It is already clear that the community of the community currently available for the support of this region will not be sufficient in order to cover the enormous needs that will occur after a permanent end of peace.I would like to emphasize this.I would like to point out the advice, and if necessary the parliament, that we are not allowed to promise more than we can ultimately hold.I repeat that a change in Middle East policy will require a fundamentally new course with regard to the support requested by us and expected support.I hope I can assume that we want to provide this support.As Mr. Gama said at the beginning, progress has been made in recent months and weeks.Nevertheless, this difficult process will inevitably be accompanied by problems and disappointments.We will do everything so that this process can be successfully completed and we can meet the tasks and challenges that will be associated with this agreement.Finally, for those who have only come to the plenum in the last few minutes, I would like to repeat what I have already pointed out at the beginning: Unfortunately, I cannot remain until the end of the pronunciation, because this debate was originally supposed to take place in the morning and I have therefore made an appointment for a conversation about the situation in the Balkans for the evening.I hope the members of the house understand.President!Commissioner Patten can count on our understanding.I would like to tell him that the connections to Madrid have normally improved and that is why I hope to see him there soon.The explanations that we heard during the day for peace process in the Middle East come because of the crowded journey that Minister Gama - I also regretted his absence from this pronunciation - accompanied by further council representatives in the area.The tenor of the news in the media about the latest events in the area could arrange for us to a pessimistic view of the situation.I am honestly of the opinion that such an assessment would not do justice to the facts.In this regard, I share the positive perspectives of Commissioner Patten.With this I want to say the following: It is true that the Israeli government has postponed the third handover of the territory of the West Bank to the Palestinian authorities.But it is also true that since the signing of the Sharm El -Heikh agreement, 39 % of the territory of the West Bank and two thirds of the Gaza strip have been handed over to the Palestinian self -government, and - what is most important - this agreement has been met with the most important thing, especially since even its postponement is a privilege provided for in Sharm El -Heikh.	de
And we must also understand that at the level of the European Union there will be contradictions between the various common policies, in this case the development.We must understand that these contradictions exist and we must reduce them to the minimum, just and wise objective, to which the presentation of this resolution is due.I believe that the idea of ​​the creation of an Observatory on the evolution of this coherence between community policies and cooperation and development, whose scope of action should not be limited to community policies, but must also cover the actions or policies of the Member States, including the actions of economic groups, which seems important to me, it is quite wise and pertinent.This observatory must prepare an annual report on the evolution and repercussions of these policies and their conjugation.I have left for the end an issue that seems fundamental to me and that this Parliament must - it seems to me - take into account and approve.That new objective of minimizing contradictions between the cooperation and development policy and the other policies must be a valid objective not only within the European Union, but also at the worldwide, given the increased globalization of the economy.If we want a fair world trade we have to impose that same principle at the level of the next round of multilateral negotiations in the World Trade Organization, because it would be contradictory that the European Union was imposing a strong discipline, although fair, although fair, so that then the United States and other great powers came to do the opposite and take advantage of what we do not do.Therefore, it is fair and fundamental that these principles are established in the next round of the World Trade Organization.Mr. President, I would like to limit myself to the relationship between development cooperation and agriculture.A considerable part of the funds has been allocated in past years to the development of agriculture and livestock in developing countries and especially in Lomé countries.The results have not shown what we expected.What can be the cause?I believe that the origin must be sought, in the first place, in the absence of a clear agricultural policy in the different developing countries, with the corresponding exceptions.I think the commission must play an important role in the development of that policy.No farmer, wherever it is, will produce something if prices are too low.The governments of developing countries are always facing a difficult choice: who should we support, farmers or the people of the big cities who want cheap foods?This subtle balance must be achieved with the support of the Commission, and not only by this institution;Also the Member States themselves provide help in most countries in which the Commission is active.The policy of the Member States cannot be allowed to contradict that of the Commission.The delegations of this institution in developing countries must play a governing role in the realization of the political dialogue and must occupy that all countries follow the same line.	es
We consider the fact that the Commission wants to dismantle or propose to dismantle, judging itself not to the height, for example the powers, which are also conferred by the Treaty, of execution of common policies.What do we somehow ask a government?What do we ask this structure, so to speak, ambiguous and particular that is the European community?It is good that common resources have a supranational government and that they are not delegated to member states or BAT, as it has happened in the past.It seems to me that you propose the same menu, but it proposes it in an aggravated way, limiting herself, she says, to the tasks of conception of some white photographer, as she proposed to us.The fear that I have - even if it shakes the head, president - is that this translates into what some countries have thought for years, that is, that the commission must be a good secretariat of the Council of Ministers.If this is the role that the Commission intends to take in the next five years, we, convinced federalists, are sure that this is not the right path to go and on this we will call it and judge what the commission intends to do.The reform is important but, if it leads to a slacation, a reduction and a decrease in the supranational powers of the Commission, it goes of the system of European integration, the one that the founding fathers had thought for the European Commission.As for the other points, Mr. President, for example, I take that of economic and social policy: of course the European social model is in deep crisis, certain that the problem of unemployment, not surprisingly, is the number one problem that none of our policy has managed to solve, but it is not certain that it can be solved by making the list of the problems we have spoken in the past, without having a clear vision, a proposal, that for which there are economies in our Europe thatMore sustained and that, not surprisingly, are the economies that have been able to make the flexibility of the labor market and the company number one.If we continue to get bogged down in the proposals that have given bad fruits to date, I don't know how we can do and what the commission will be able to do.The same applies to the expansion as an end in itself, without being linked to a much more effective reform of the European Union and its structures, to the proposals that the Commission could have made even in the CIG.Mr President, a positive thing I want to tell her, perhaps contrary to the notice of some colleagues, as regards the telegram that sent to the Austrian government.His position has convinced us: he did well not to further isolate that country.However, we will see the practical act, what concrete gestures will be.I repeat, Mr. President: it is a vision, in our opinion, a little short -sighted.Above all, there is no impulse in the sectors that I mentioned, for example as regards the Balkans.	it
However, I must add that the cooperation of our working groups with similar groups in third countries has gone too far in the eyes of the Member States.We have therefore come to a modification in committee.The commission will nevertheless take into account the expectations of the Parliament once again in the reworked version and submit the guidelines thus modified.She will thus continue to fight so that this objective becomes acceptable in the eyes of the Member States.A final information about the 13 amendments deposited.Of these 13 amendments, only three cannot be accepted by the Commission, namely amendments 3, 12 and 13. All the others can be accepted, either completely either in their minds.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is an extraordinary coincidence to discuss during this period of the Equal initiative within the European Parliament.In recent times and because of political developments in Austria, there has been an increasing political concern in Europe, but also political statements and dialogue.It should be noted that concrete policies must be presented both in Parliament and to the Commission.Concrete proposals both for legislation and action plans which concern the fight against discrimination, and which concern the establishment of freedoms and social rights.Thus, allow me to make a small allusion to the train of measures against discrimination, praying to the commissions responsible for the Parliament to appoint rapporteurs, in order to approach the train of measures against discrimination as quickly as possible.I now come to the Equal initiative which is of course based on article 13. The Equal initiative concerns all forms of discrimination on the basis of article 13, that is to say the fight against discrimination based on sex, race, age, disability.In particular, I would like to congratulate Ms. Stenzel because her attempts in order to conclude the agreement on the Equal initiative are particularly difficult and complex, not only because the commissions involved defended totally different points of view but also because it was an extremely delicate political subject.The first observation, which was also formulated by many other colleagues, refers to the question of whether it takes a separate mention for women.Admittedly, we have expressed our disagreement as to an aspect of article 13, but the treaty at this moment is such that it is, and among the discrimination categories we find discrimination on the basis of sex.Thus, in accordance with the treaty as it presents itself today, the Equal initiative is structured in this way.However, I want to recall that there is a special axis for the employment strategy that concerns women and that a special program is preparing, the fifth program for equality between men and women.I divided into four groups the subjects that attracted the attention of colleagues.First, the enlargement of thematic domains.There are four thematic areas, like employment strategy, employability, entrepreneurship, adaptability and equal opportunities, and we agree on the enlargement of these thematic fields in accordance with the proposals that have been submitted by the European Parliament.As for concern in relation to the possible danger of attributing to a single country all the funds for one of the categories undergoing discrimination, I would say that it is stipulated in the initiative, with the greatest possible clarity that the Member States will have to submit a thematic domain for all categories undergoing discrimination.	fr
Austria is a country open to the world in which xenophobia and discrimination have no place.What happens in Austria is an absolutely normal process of change of power after democratic elections for which confidence has been withdrawn to an old system and has sought and found a stable parliamentary majority to carry out the necessary economic and social reforms.There will be a majority that works as well as an opposition that will also work.The European Popular Party, whom I represent in this Parliament, has been and is a party that has always advisable for the integration of my country in the EU and feels deeply attached to the community of values ​​of the European Union as well as its basic political lines related to its deepening and expansion.We respect and accept the debate and we also have understanding of the concern expressed in many of our member countries for the future evolution in Austria.We have understanding because we know that due to our very recent history we also have a special political responsibility in the present.Our country was not only the first victim of Hitler's dictatorship but many were also actors, although he rejects any collective guilt.Austria has found its way to the European Union not last thanks to the ÖVP.The site of my country is not outside the European Union but within it ... ..., and also with all rights and obligations.A future government must be prosecuted for the values ​​and principles that defends in its government program and not by the prejudices that have, in part, political opponents and, in part, are disseminated by international media.The recognition of human rights, democracy and the rule of law, a sincere review of Austria's role in the past, a delivery of information on the greatest crime against humanity in the twentieth century, the Holocaust, will also be reflected in the agreement of the principles of a future coalition government between the ÖVP and the FPö.My party is going to be guarantor that my country is still on the course of European policy and on the basis of the community of European values.(Applause) Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Council, representatives of the Commission.It is a black day for Austria and for Europe.In this fact, the framework of Mr. Sichrovsky's lies or the appeased words of Mrs. Stenzel cannot change anything.It has reached the point that two irresponsible politicians, corroded by the desire for power, sell the image, political role and, in part, also the economic interests of Austria.(Applause, exclamations) change this for obtaining the position of a head of government and participation in a government.They accept that Austria, to be a respected country, becomes a despised country, as well as the isolation of the country and, consequently, also in part of its citizens.	es
In this question we need much more openness and transparency than before.It cannot be concerned that a measure like this is imposed on the Member States without proper public debate.President, values, colleagues!In the name of the radical MPs, I found myself in the Committee on Budget Control in the vote on the present report of the voice because I share the concerns that are undoubtedly important by the representative of another, namely the Common Law.We undoubtedly exercise pressure with this report, as we believe that certain aspects require a solution and fraud in the community must be combated and contained.However, it cannot be accepted without criticism of how under the impetuous urge and with the dogged determination of committee chairman Theato our committee would like to conclude this report.Another important criticism of the report concerns the derived right.According to Article 280 of the contract, the Council can decide to combat fraud.However, we are a little dismayed that a facility that would mean a qualitative leap is recommended without immediately for predicting the resulting consequences, i.h.that the aspect of defense and thus the possibility of effective functioning of charges and defense are neglected in such an important legal system.This dismay should be expressed with my abstention in the committee.President!In my opinion, this topic in the European Parliament, both in the plenary and in the committees, must be thought out loud, even if, of course, not without taking into account the legal culture and the circles in which the institutional issues are dealt with.It is about very serious incidents that seemed common in the past.In the meantime, certain changes have occurred, at least among the mechanisms, especially when it comes to control.However, we are not yet satisfied, especially not if the responsible committees even spoke of a European law enforcement agency for crimes committed at European level, fraud, embezzlement and disclosure of official secrets.Undoubtedly, we should protect the interests of the community and their reputation as well as the relationship with the taxpayers who form an essential and essential component of community life.For this reason, it is right to raise the problem of a general and universal interest protection, which is better coordinated with the national judiciary.The most difficult problem arises here: What position does a European law enforcement agency take in relationships with the individual national communities and their respective judicial systems?In my opinion, this topic must be treated both from cultural and practical aspects.Today there is a risk of overlapping the multitude of different institutions existing in the individual countries.Mr President, I would like to say something quickly to two points.First: I do not want to refer to the philosophical questions of subsidiarity and the sovereignty of the Member States, although I am very important to make such a debate, because my regular look at British television stations reveals me what is conjured up by national politicians in threat to domestic legal culture.Sometimes this is already tiring and deserves a discussion.But that's not my point.	de
"In any case, weak businesses are further weakened by the AIDS virus.Resources that have already been overused are still being stressed.In the countries with the highest AIDS rates, 50 % and more of all hospital beds are currently occupied by AIDS patients.To a completely different thing.I would like to support Kuba's membership as a AKP country as part of the new Lomé Agreement, which will soon be agreed between the European Union and the countries of Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific.I know that this is controversial in a way, especially because of the government's attitude towards the Castro regime.On this occasion, however, the European Union will demand the inclusion of political criteria in the Lomé Agreement.Criteria of good practice of state behavior, which extends refugee issues, corruption, human rights and democracy, will be part of the final agreement between the European Union and all signatory states of the Lomé Agreement from Africa, Caribbean and the Pacific region.The Lomé Agreement, on which the entire structure of the relationship between the European Union and the 71 states in Africa, in the Caribbean area and in the Pacific Ocean, is still the most efficient and demanding development instrument in the context of the north-south relationships. After years of ""good and loyal service"", the most important symbol of the efforts of the European Union about improving the lot remainsThe poorest countries and the promotion of their development.This shows the human face of Europe ... In John Corrie's report, the importance of this unique, targeted instrument and the work of the parity assembly that uses this instrument are very important.This is all the more true when the precarious structure of this ambitious structure was endangered.Negotiations on the path of the partnership between the European Union and the AKP countries to the new millennium were a very difficult trial.I welcome today that reason and generosity have triumphed about the difficulties and that new perspectives open up for this partnership.Over thirty years after the introduction of the north-south partnership unique in their kind, the adaptation of an instrument that has proven itself, but is getting on in years, is an indispensable need to be able to counter new challenges.Therefore, the new agreement, which will be closed on May 31 of this year on the Fiji Islands for a term of 20 years, represents more than just the extension of the agreements that regulate relationships between Europe and the AKP countries.This means that your redesign must be sealed.The new agreement clearly sanctions the political dimension of a partnership that forms the only forum for dialogue and political exchange as part of the north-south relationships.Since the parity assembly continues to open the elected representatives from the parliaments of the AKP countries, this dimension not only has to be maintained, but rather encouraged.The parity assembly thus represents a platform for the defense of the common interests of the European countries and the developing countries. According to the fiasco of the conference in Seattle, our task is now to coordinate our attitude with regard to the further development of the rules for world trade, which are to be used to combat poverty.The partnership can now be created in the long term.The way for your modernization is free:"	de
Therefore, I beg you, Mrs. President, who asks the commission to manifest at this time and after the vote is proceeded.(Applause of the PSE group).Mrs. President, I want to make it very clear that, above all, the Commission has the utmost respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, among them, to establish its agenda.Therefore, we respect what Parliament can decide in this sense.But I also want to make it very clear that President Prodi committed to the Parliament to incorporate a new debate, as Mr. Barón recalled, which is added to the annual debate on the legislative program of the Commission, on the large lines of action for the next five -year period, that is, for this legislature.I mean, Madam President, that this debate was distinguished, in the agreement reached in September, of what is the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative program.And I mean, Madam President, who, on the part of the commission, we are prepared and willing to have that debate when it is convenient, that we were prepared to develop this week, as in principle had been agreed, starting from the base that there was the eve in a speech to parliamentary groups.Therefore, Madam President, I want to reiterate that, for our part, we have discussed the action program for the next five years and that we are prepared to, when the Parliament decides, - this week if that is the decision - come to expose the program for the next five years and, next month, the program for the year 2000, which was what was perfectly agreed.I propose that we vote for the request of the Group of the European Socialists Party to re -include the statement of the Commission on its strategic objectives.(Parliament rejects the petition) the president.On Wednesday, I have another proposal related to the oral question about the capital tax.The PPE-of Group requests that this point be removed from the agenda.Will any colleague take the floor on behalf of the group to justify this request?Mrs. President, I listen to some laughs among the Socialists.I have been told that also wide circles of the socialist group, they will very much see the suppression of this point of the agenda, since in the vote in the presidents conference the vote of the competent working group for this of our colleagues in the socialist group.I ignore whether this information is correct, but we as a group of the PPE/would appreciate in any case that this point was suppressed, since the Parliament has already occupied numerous times of this issue.There are also agreements against such a tax.Therefore, my group requests that this point of the day be supposed.Thank you, Mr. Poettering.Let us listen to Mr. Wurtz, who will speak against the petition.Mrs. President, first of all I want to underline the lack of logic of Mr. Poettering, who has just given a lesson to the European socialist group to deal with a decision that was made in an absolutely clear way at the presidents conference.	es
I can also agree to the part of change application 6, which suggests a change in Directive 93/53 due to scientific and technical knowledge.As I said, the ISA is not a danger to health according to the scientific knowledge.As far as the environmental impact is concerned, many should be known that a number of causes of the decline in stocks are held responsible in the course of the past decades, including pollution, overfishing, climatic changes, etc.It cannot currently be ruled out that ISA also affects wild salmon stocks.Fish have already escaped from the aquaculture systems and the virus was found in wild salmon.In this context, there are a number of open questions that can only be clarified by further scientific studies.This is also the reason why there is great caution when combating the ISA.Infested fish must not remain in the farms, and I am ready to further check this matter so that the virus is prevented from reaching the environment.For this purpose, I suggest that we change our original proposal in such a way that the Commission's approval must be obtained for the rural programs developed by the responsible authorities.This is intended to avoid excessively lengthy fishing distance periods.I also suggest that fish that have clinical signs of the disease are immediately removed.With the help of the procedures already existing in Community Law, distance programs are set up that are based on the state of health of the fish in order to maintain effects on the environment as low as possible.Based on this, I can accept change applications 7 and 8 if a slight change of No. 8.I also have great understanding for amendment, but I think that it can be put better and thus a connection between environmental issues and the strategies for fighting illness and extermination can be established.I see myself unable to advocate amendments 12 and 13.I have the feeling that this should exclude any risk.I believe that it should be very difficult to achieve this without the affected fish breeding sector being closed.I am looking forward to the views of the parliament on these amendments, and if you think that this approach is the best solution, I will attentively take note of this.I can partially accept amendment 11.In conclusion, I would like to underline that we continue to strive for a high level of health protection in accordance with our obligations from the contract.I consider measures that are appropriate to this goal to the right way.We continue to work for the extermination of the disease.This is a goal from which both the environment and the salmon breeding sector will benefit.I hope that the European Parliament recognizes our commitment by promoting our proposal.I would be very grateful for that.Thank you very much, Mr. Byrne.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.Protection of young marine animals according to the agenda follows the report (A5-0035/2000) by Mr. Gallagher on behalf of the Committee for Fisheries on the proposal for a prescription of the Council on the fourth change in regulation (EC) No. 1626/94 on technical measures to maintain fish stocks in the Mediterranean and the fourth amendment of the regulation (EC) No. 850/98 to maintain the fishing resources by technical measuresProtection of young marine animals (KOM (1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222 (CNS)).	de
"It is clear that many who, in Wales, see the program of structural funds as a means to stop some of the great difficulties that we are undoubtedly confronted.We have found that poverty is growing in Wales, a trend that has been strengthening since 1997. We have seen the gap between the rich and the poor widening.We are therefore expecting the structural fund program that it is not limited to considering industrial restructuring, we want it to also bring more improvements to the entire economic base of Wales.What brings us great prejudice to us, however, is to believe that, in a way, the granting of structural funds was a victory for the government, when it only recognizes that Wales is faced with very great difficulties.This is why I would like to highlight certain points that the commission should, in my opinion, place in the foreground.We hope that the Commission will deal with points related to additionality.We deplore that, in a way, the British figures have masked the Welsh figures.We also hope that the Commission will provide appropriate funding projects.We hope that it will guarantee, by going against the British government, the participation of the private sector in the planning phase, as it is sure that this must provide the main momentum to the expenses of the structural funds.Finally, we ask the commissions to ensure that the structural funds are spent transparently.Within this parliament, transparency is too often lacking.In this area, the Commission can become the great friend of Wales.Mr. President, our committee deals with these questions in many different angles, and to start I will talk about the angle of research.We consider it very positive that, in its conclusions, the rapporteur has taken into account our proposal according to which research infrastructure should be extended in cohesion countries by implanting professional schools and universities so that they serve the populations of the least developed regions better and that they allow trained people to remain in their region of origin.It is something that it is possible to perform by taking measures at the level of the public authorities.Such decentralization of higher education is undoubtedly a useful policy when it is a question of guaranteeing development.The second point on which we wanted to attract attention, precisely with the view of industrial policy, it is that we would have wanted by reflecting on the coordination of structural funds and the cohesion fund, the Commission attaches greater attention to the impact of the progression of services, electronic commerce and the use of the Internet.In the past, poverty and wealth were more dependent on the structures of economic life.The rich regions were those where there were industrial jobs, while today these regions can very well have become a burden and be poor.It therefore becomes necessary to also carry out investments in the new sectors of activity, so -called ""electronic"" production and the production of electronic services, because they are sectors of the future."	fr
The best prevention for the future is the certainty that the charters will have to be heavily, civilly, criminally and financially condemned if they are not extremely vigilant about the safety of the ships they choose.Second, the condition of a double shell for oil tankers admitted to frequent community waters must be imposed as quickly as possible and not given to Greek calendars.Third, a strict limitation of the age of ships admitted to frequent community waters must be quickly fixed.It could be a maximum of fifteen years.Without obtaining a sufficiently clear, strict and rigorous community regulatory framework, the Member States which, for their part, wish to establish one should be allowed to do so to protect its population and their territory, in the same way that the United States has managed to learn from the disaster of the Exxon Valdez by demanding the double hull and banish from their waters all ships of more than twenty years.This is how the United States had refused Erika access to its waters.If the community had done the same, a huge disaster would have been avoided.Let us make sure, Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, to learn this time really the lesson, even when media emotion and parliamentary emotion will be used.Mr. President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic BRAVERY, HAVEN, AMOCO CADIZ, GINO, Tanio, there are all names of disaster memory.And now Erika.Who is the turn?Twenty-one year after the Amoco Cadiz, this umpteenth of the dark, the seventh since 1967, proves the irresponsibility of our successive rulers.The West Atlantic is once again paying the high price of their inability to react, of their capitulation in front of the multinationals.It is difficult to understand why French and Europeans authorize what Americans refuse, and why Europe, usually so quick to legislate in terms of environment, has skipped maritime security.The result is there.The Erika, a beating ship Maltese pavilion, amber wreck classified among the most dangerous oil tankers, soiled our ribs over more than 400 km, which represents much more serious pollution than that caused by the Amoco Cadiz.Elected from Loire-Atlantique, I unfortunately can testify.These repetitive disasters are not natural, they owe nothing to fatality.They are the consequence of the inconsistency of men.It is indeed an ecological disaster.Only those who have harsh realities on the ground have doubted it.It is also an economic catastrophe for all those who live from the sea and tourism, fishermen, oyster farmers, conchyls, malaria, traders, etc.Erika's bug must be the last in the series.We must first shed light on this sinking.Why not appoint a parliamentary commission of inquiry or associate parliamentarians with the mission which was announced earlier by the Commission?Then, we must legislate urgently, first, so that the exact characteristics of the transported goods are known.Indeed, according to experts, Erika oil had to flow by the bottom and never reach the ribs.	fr
You said that the preventive principle should not be used as a hidden obstacle to the trade.Is this aspect interpreted in the same way on both sides of the Atlantic?In my opinion, we will have problems with hormonally treated beef and genetically modified plants.Will the Americans take the same point of view on this question as we do?President!I can be pleased to say that we have just signed a protocol for biological security in Montreal.This makes it possible for us to achieve agreement in an international forum about the definition of the precautionary principle.I consider the signing of this protocol to be a breakthrough on this question.I believe that it will form the basis for future discussions on the preventive principle, because we will be able to use it as an example of the interpretation of this principle.In addition, this protocol is also recognized as an important and valuable instrument.President!I have two questions and will try to take myself very briefly.My first question relates to the application of the precautionary principle.If I understand that correctly, there were some ambiguities.Is it that a risk test including a cost benefit analysis, i.e. a cost-beefit analysis, has to be carried out first?If this corresponded to the facts, it would be very worrying, since it was actually not intended to use a cost-benefit analysis as an instrument when deciding on the application of the precautionary principle.Instead, the precautionary principle should have priority.My second question concerns the burden of proof.I remember Ms. Wallström's idea as the new commissioner in the committee.At that time she spoke of introducing a reverse burden of proof, i.e.h.The manufacturer of a product must demonstrate its safe.I am now interested in whether this also applies in the document now submitted by the Commission.Thank you very much, Ms. Schörling.You have asked two important questions and I am pleased that I will now get the opportunity to comment on it.No, it does not have to be started with a cost-benefit analysis, but the basis should be an assessment of our level of knowledge and the knowledge of science as well as its evaluation compared to the dangers that we see for the environment or human or animal health.However, if a certain measure has been decided, the cost -effective implementation should be chosen.This is intended to prevent measures from being taken that are completely inappropriate in terms of their effectiveness.So you don't have to start with a cost-benefit analysis.The second question concerned the reverse burden of proof.It is completely correct that we have to use them in certain cases.A good example of an area in which this is necessary is the chemical strategy.However, it is about a single subject area, while this notification of the precautionary principle can be described as horizontal, i.h.It affects all political subject areas.For this reason, a reverse burden of proof or its formation is not discussed separately in this context, but instead it is about political decision -making and the foundations for this.However, it is absolutely correct that, for example, we have to come to a reverse burden of proof in the chemicals.Mr President, in my opinion, the precautionary principle would have to be quite radical, otherwise you will always lose yourself in the winding labyrinths of the interpretations.	de
"I finally come to the agreement on South Africa, which also spoke of the rapporteur.I am simply delighted - not to say happy - to be able to announce to you this evening, as a conclusion to this debate of circumstance, that the South African president accepted today the solution proposed unanimously last Monday by the Council of Ministers of Foreign Affairs of the EU about the problems hanging with South Africa.The ""Grouppa war"" is therefore over.Peace has returned and we can now hope for a collaboration with South Africa on the basis of common values ​​and dreams that bring us closer.Here, I think, a good conclusion to this very interesting debate and I reiterate my thanks to the rapporteur as well as at the assembly for the collaboration which settled in the context of the relations between the countries of the Third World and our work.Thank you, Mr. Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at noon.Stabilization and association Agreement with ARYM The agenda calls for the report (A5-0031/2000) of Mr. Swoboda, on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, on the recommendation of the Commission relating to a decision of the Council authorizing the Commission to negotiate a stabilization and association agreement with the old Yugoslav Republic of(Sec (1999) 1279 -C5-0166/1999 -1999/2121 (COS)).Mr. President, Commissioner Patten, dear colleagues, it is today a question of a country which has just overcome very difficult times, a country, which is however in the process of raising the slope, its own forces, by its own will and with the support of the international community.If the European Union, the Council and the Commission - I suppose that Parliament will be rallying to this decision tomorrow - propose for the first time in Southeast Europe to conclude a stabilization and association agreement in the Balkan region - I hope to be able to use this term throughout my intervention -, it constitutes in the first place a recognition of the work accomplished by the Arym/Macedonia on the economic level, but alsoSanta to the surroundings and the ethnic minority that inhabits the country.Because having a minority of 33 to 35 % on its own territory is certainly not an easy task with regard to the vicinity of this country.This country and its politicians - undoubtedly different from one region to another - have always carried out remarkable work, it should be recognized.The Commission invites us to conclude an agreement with the Council.I would like to make two or three remarks concerning precisely the areas in which there may remain some differences of view.In this regard, however, I would like to underline the quality of the work carried out by Commissioner Patten and I salute the interest he has in Arym and the whole region.Let's talk about the regional approach first of all.If it is understood correctly, I think this regional approach is important and necessary."	fr
"I also underlined the need for prevention.The participation of the social partners must also be underlined.It takes flexibility and the administrative burden must be reduced, this is a priority.Flexibility is also needed for countries with small budgets.Although I think that certain aspects of the report could be better treated in another way, I believe on the whole that this report offers a flexible and supposed approach and that it is necessary to support it.By this Equal Community initiative, the Commission wants to replace community and adaptation community initiatives, as well as various sub -programs in this sector - NOW (new opportunities for women), Horizon (for people with disabilities), Youthstart (Integration of young people on the labor market) and Integra (for endangered groups) - with the aggravating circumstance that the sums planned have been significantlyreduced.Thus, it is through this initiative that the Commission will be implemented as new methods of combating discrimination and inequalities of all kinds in the context of the labor market, based on the four pillars of the directives of employment policy.It is a lot for so few means.But to guarantee possibilities for success to this new methodology, the Commission should have opted for a less complex, simpler and direct proposal, with the participation of NGOs from the start of the process, so that partnerships develop in a balanced way.She didn't do it.We hope that it will want to reconsider at least the points we have mentioned.Mr. President, some will remember a successful film, ""Cocoon"", in which elderly people find a second youth by drinking special water.It is therefore extremely important to pay the greatest attention to the water that we all drink and to follow and approve the provisions relating to it.This is why I voted in favor of this common provision, but I would like to emphasize that I hope that we will especially watch out what the degree of purity of the water is maximum when it enters our homes.I noticed, in the arrangement which was approved, the lack - but I am sure that it will be remedied there - support for those who purify water from them, in their own home.Aside from amendment 76, where I made an error, because my intention was to vote for, my votes could explain itself by the following fiction: supposed project of environmental directive: ""Directive of the European Parliament and the Council, establishing the obligation to maintain during the winter, in the streets, places and gardens of European cities a temperature of at least eighteen degrees.""Main lines of the directive: a) Each city will have to have sufficient energy and technological means for this objective to be reached in 2012;b) The costs will be fully borne by the inhabitants of each city, and will be added to the electricity bill.Opinion of a deputy for northern Europe: ""This directive would be unfair because, for example, the cost for a resident of Stockholm would be more than two hundred times higher than the cost for a resident of Naples."""	fr
Work in connection with the BSE cattle disease is running in the Member States, and the introduction of stab test tests to determine infectiousity in the Member States is being used.I know that Ms. Roth-Behrendt has already asked me this question, and I was currently doing a quick solution, but as far as I know, cross-departmental consultations are currently taking place in the Commission.In any case, work is done.I hope that the next time you ask me this question, I can serve with more detailed information.Ms. Jackson inquires about the 24 new laws and 20 updates and asks whether this does not lead to more over -regulation.With these regulations, we want to close gaps in applicable laws.It is less about setting up new or additional regulatory systems, even though that is part of it, but it is about uncovering and closing and closeing vulnerability and gaps in the chain to the consumer.The accession candidates were mentioned, and of course we thought of that.Food safety and security in many other areas are of crucial importance in connection with the expansion.I made Mr. Verhogen aware of this problem.Mr. Commissioner!The ignorance of some member countries has brought us into a great food crisis in Europe, and, unfortunately, I am annoyed again that today, when they present this interesting report, the Council in entirety is once again missing.I would very much like to know from you how you want to make sure that such a new authority, whatever it may mean in detail, also gets influence on the advice, who is in charge in this authority.Of course, we must not prescribe anything in terms of content, but I already insist that the parliament keeps its right to Maastricht and Amsterdam.I have great concern that we will once again get an authority that flies anonymously through Europe as a satellite;I would love such an authority like the devil the holy water.I hope it will not happen!I also welcome the white book.But will the food authority also have enough authority to prevent appearances such as the beef war and France's refusal to remove the ban?They mentioned that the Commission had the opportunity to withhold subsidies and subsidies similar to France.Could you also imagine that the Commission, for example, would make interim payments similar to those that are currently required by the British farmers?President!Mr. Commissioner!In the last week they said at an information event that they were of the opinion that the future EU food authority should not be located on the periphery, but did not deal in more detail, which means periphery.The work of the EU authority shifted to Dublin has proven that geographical removal is not an obstacle to efficiency and connections.The most important tasks of the future food authority were the recording, publication and coordination of data, the creation of recommendations for the development of food safety and - as they said - the collection of scientific information and their popularization among consumers.All of these things can be realized anywhere in the field of the European Union with modern technology.	de
I would like to answer the two inquiries as follows.When joining the European Union, Sweden was allowed to maintain its quantitative restrictions on alcoholic beverages that travelers can introduce to the country from other member states.This exemption from the principle of free goods traffic and freedom of movement expires on June 30 of this year.Sweden now wishes to extend this measure by another five years, which is necessary in the interest of ethnicity.My position on this is clear.Since joining the Union, Sweden has had enough time to coordinate his policy on a state without such import restrictions.Therefore, I see no reason to stimulate further extension of this measure.The citizens of Europe have the right to acquire goods for their own use in any Member State, including taxes, and to introduce them to another Member State without these goods being undergoing controls or may have to be taxed again.Deviations from this basic principle of the internal market must remain limited exceptions.We would like to ensure that Sweden's citizens like other citizens of the European Union are now also enjoying the advantages of the internal market.This does not mean that I would not share Sweden's concern about possible health problems that can be caused by alcohol abuse.However, a expertise recently made by Professor Lindgren from the University of Lund proves that the abolition of the restrictions of alcohol consumption in Sweden does not increase.I already had the opportunity twice to present my position to Mr. Ringholm, the Swedish finance minister.Last week I also discussed this matter with the finance committee of the Swedish parliament.Now the government of Sweden is responsible for taking suitable steps.Thank you for this answer, Mr. Commissioner!First of all, I regret that an error has crept into my request to the Commission.There is an end date in 2004, but of course it must be called 1st July 2000.To a certain extent I understand to a certain extent for the commission's point of view that exceptional regulations should only be temporary and the rule is the normal case.Nevertheless, I would like to ask you two questions: Do you still commemorate further discussions with the Swedish government to extend the exemptions, for example as long as such regulations apply to Denmark and Finland?My second question refers to common alcohol policy.You can consider this as a question of the internal market, but also as a question of public health in the entire EU.What role do alcohol politics and aspects of public health play in the work of the Commission?Alcohol policy across Europe is not exclusively about the internal market, but also about public health.If we had considered these aspects in connection, the discussions with Sweden might have been easier to have.I can thank Mr. Andersson for the additional question on his first request and give him the following answer.First, for Finland and Denmark, exceptions from the basic principle of free goods traffic apply until 2003.These countries are currently preparing measures so that they are equipped for imports of alcoholic drinks in 2003.In the case of Sweden, the situation is nevertheless different.

"You explained previously that we run in disaster and we do nothing.You have to provide a quick procedure!I would like to say above all that I agree with the priorities in the identification of the personal responsibilities invoked by the Honorable MP.As for judicial structuring, we have had the opportunity to hear several times the description made by Mr. Kouchner of the great difficulties which he encounters in the assembly of an administrative machine and a judicial structure.We know that the first steps took place several months ago.We know the difficulties, especially of a financial nature, with which Mr. Kouchner was confronted in the assembly of this administrative machine and in particular the difficulty in recruiting the police forces for public security.It is a responsibility, Mr. MP, who is still present within the framework of the European Union and I would like to tell you that this question was underlined, as for Kosovo, during the ""General Affairs"" council on Monday.There have been declarations and pressures exerted from the various Member States which have undertaken to provide police forces.Some Member States have taken refuge behind the fact that they have armed forces on the ground and that they cannot complete, as quickly as it would be desirable, the police forces they have committed to providing.We are perfectly aware that this circumstance decisively compromises the work of Mr. Kouchner, the regularization and normalization of the administrative structure of Kosovo, especially the judicial part and the police coverage.This leads to harmful, clear and obvious effects, on the ability to regulate the articulation between ethnic groups and we are aware that if measures are not taken in the short term, we could go to the front of tension situations such as those we have known a few hours ago and to the repetition of these situations of tension in other areas of Kosovo.This is a question essentially located in the context of NATO, but about which the European Union has no difficulty associated with the reading of NATO with regard to these questions.You know, Mr. MP, the difficulty that exists at the level of the selection of objectives during a military action, especially when it takes place using aerial means;You also know that a set of objectives are aimed at infrastructure and aim to hinder the functioning of the war machine.We obviously approach land, a gray area, where you will tell me that these are civilian objectives, such as bridges, road or rail infrastructure, while others will say that these are military objectives, because they are used to support military structures in their assault actions, such as those carried out at the time by the forces of Mr. Milosevic inside Kosovo.It is this difference in interpretation of the military objectives that separates us."	fr
At the request of a French deputy, Mr. Zimeray, a request has been submitted, whose signatories have been numerous and among which I tell me, however, in accordance with the position constantly expressed by the European Parliament and throughout the European Community, I ask youcondemn to death and indulum to the convicted.All this, in accordance with the principles that we have always supported.Thank you, Lord according to, I will do it very good.It is, without a doubt, within the line of the positions that our Parliament has always adopted.Mrs. President, I would like to get your attention to a case that has been occupied again and again.This is the case of Alexander Nikitin.We all celebrate that the court has declared him innocent and that he has shown that in Russia access to information on the environment is a constitutional right.However, it happens that he will be accused again, as the prosecutor will file an appeal.We know and have really affirmed in many resolutions - precisely in the last plenary session of last year - that this is not only a legal case and that it is a mistake to accuse Alexander Nikitin of criminal and treason conduct, because we, as affected by their results, obtain benefit from it.These results constitute the basis of the European programs of the Barent Sea and, therefore, I ask you to study a draft letter that describes the most relevant facts and that this position is evident to Russia that is consistent with the decisions of Parliament.Yes, Mrs. Schroedter, willingly I will examine the facts related to this topic as soon as you receive your letter.Mrs. President, first of all I would like to congratulate her for having fulfilled her promise since in this first period of New Year's sessions the number of channels in our offices has been drastically expanded.However, Mrs. President, what I had asked has not been done.It is true that now there are two Finnish and one Portuguese channels, but there are still none of the Dutch and I had asked for a Dutch channel, because also the Dutch would like to hear the news every month, when they send us to this exile.Therefore I would like to ask you again to be in charge of seeing a Dutch channel.Mrs. Plooij-Van Gorsel, I can tell you that this issue is on the agenda of the meeting of Questors set for Wednesday.I hope it is examined with a positive spirit.Mrs. President, could I tell me why this Parliament does not comply with the health and security legislation that she has actually approved?Why has no air quality test of this building been done since we have been chosen?	es
Under these conditions, could the Commission indicate when it intends to note, under article 7.1, the existence of a serious and persistent violation by a Member State of the principles set out in article 6 paragraph 1 and to urgently pray, ruling the qualified majority, to suspend some of the rights arising from the application of this treaty to Austria, in particular the voting rights of the representative of Austria to the Council?Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, let me start to respond by recalling the position that the commission had adopted with regard to the composition of the new Austrian government, reiterated this morning by President Romano Prodi about the Austrian government, which contains ministers belonging to the Austrian freedom of Mr. Jörg Haider.I refer, of course, to the declaration made by the Commission on February 1, 2000, which I will start by recalling the main lines.The Commission said and reaffirms today that it shares the underlying concerns of the January 31 declaration of the Portuguese presidency.These concerns are legitimate and founded.There is no need to recall here the political journey of Mr. Jörg Haider and his many xenophobic and racist public statements, therefore anti-European.The fact that a clearly extremist, racist and xenophobic party comes to power in a member state of the European Union cannot fail to concern other states which participate in the European project, in the same way that it does not leave the European Commission indifferent.Second, the Commission reiterated and reiterates the commitment it has made to continue to exercise its duty as a guardian of the treaties, in particular with regard to articles 6 and 7 of the Treaty on the European Union.One of the important innovations of the Amsterdam Treaty consists in the introduction of an explicit mention of the fundamental principles which constitute the common heritage of the Member States and the creation of a mechanism of control of their respect as well as a reaction in the event of violation of one of these principles.The Commission has thus demonstrated in practice its attachment to one of the fundamental principles: that of the rule of law.This principle obliges the Commission to act within the limits fixed by the treaties and it is in this context that its declaration of February 1 is located.The Commission is not a state and cannot or must act in such quality.But, to respond concretely to the question of the Honorable MP, it should be recalled that the mechanism established by article 7, paragraph 1, of the Treaty on the European Union requires, to be activated, that I quote, the existence of a serious and persistent violation of principles set out in article 6. A serious and persistent violation, I repeat, constitutes the essential condition so that the Commission can proposethe adoption of measures against a Member State.It seems obvious to me that the conditions for applying this mechanism to the situation in Austria are not met.Furthermore, I think I am not mistaken in saying that we all hope that these conditions of serious and persistent violation of human rights and democracy will never be combined either for Austria, or for any other Member State of the Union.	fr
This system is financed through a special fund to which buyers of new vehicles contribute.Mr Breyer, is all this perhaps reprehensible from an ecological point of view?In my opinion, no.The Netherlands represent an exemplary model of disposal of vehicles as proposed by the directive;The question if the relative charges should fall on the buyer of a new vehicle or on the manufacturer, in the case of a vehicle already in circulation, has nothing to do with ecology, but is a problem related exclusively to competition!The question is if a European manufacturer should set aside 250 million euros and a Korean producer perhaps 2 million;Keeping in due consideration, the people employed in Europe in the automotive sector are in favor of that there are no distortions on competition.In compliance with the interests of environmental protection, however, I want to ensure for the last holder the gratuity of the system, which will have to be financed through a special fund, and I want to guarantee the responsibility of the producers in the case of new vehicles, because in this way they will also have the responsibility of building easy vehicles to recycle!(Applause from the benches of the PSE group) Mr. President, the proposal in question presents many positive aspects, in particular for waste management, reuse, recovery and recycling of components and materials, etc.I think it is an excellent proposal.The discussion mainly affects one point: is it up to the manufacturer, the final seller or others the responsibility to collect the vehicle out of use free of charge or not?I will illustrate the example of my country in order to clarify how the system works without any problem.We have entered into an agreement with all the parties involved, i.e. car manufacturers, second -hand cars retailers, the confederation of the automotive industry, companies involved in the treatment of metals, operators who deal with scrapping and public authority.An agreement for the protection of the environment has been signed on a voluntary basis.The automotive industry, and Belgium is a country where there is a high production of vehicles, has not raised any problems.Our fellow citizens can deliver their vehicles out of use for free to the final retailer.Consequently, we have noticed - unlike what is affirmed here, that is, that this would be at the expense of employment - that a series of small businesses deals with the recycling of materials in an optimal way.Some companies have assumed a leading role, as they manage to recycle certain materials, including some who have not yet been implemented in the directive.This means that we are developing a new sector, creating new jobs, and at the same time we make an important service to the environment.I am in favor of the withdrawal free of charge.In my country we managed to do it;Why shouldn't we do it elsewhere too?Mr. President, honorable parliamentarians, thanks for this interesting discussion, full of important arguments.I ask you to have the patience to endure me for a few more minutes.Allow me to briefly illustrate some of the principles and starting points from which this directive moved.First of all, I would like to start with some comments and some answers to the most important observations that have characterized this discussion.	it
As recognized in the SwoBoda report, its conditions do not hope peace, but a greater political and economic influence on the country, control of its natural riches, the exploitation of its workforce and the use of the country as an operational basis against nations and peoples that oppose the new order in that region.Everything is offered in exchange for the promise of a future entry of the country into the union.The report welcomes these guidelines as well as the most general policy of the EU for Sudoriental Europe.It is indicative that in the relationship we congratulate the ERIM for its constructive attitude during the attack of NATO.The praise for his peaceful role are tired as he has accepted the deployment of the forces NATO in his territory, but nothing is said of the indignation expressed by his people with mass mobilizations against the persistence of NATO bombings.Finally, since we believe that the stability pact and the stabilization and association procedure applied by the union to the countries of the region will cause new problems in those areas and new horrors for their inhabitants, further strengthening the hegemonic role of American and European imperialists, we will vote against the report to express solidarity with the people of Erim.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, one of the fundamental objectives of the stabilization and association agreement with the former Iugoslav Republic of Macedonia is the consolidation of stability and peace in the region, which of course presupposes the development and maintenance of the relationships of good neighborhood between the countries concerned.I will not bore you with the details relating to the question of the name of the ERIM which, as you certainly know, is a reason for contrast with Greece and for more than four years it has been the subject of not only of negotiations between the two countries, under the aegis of the UN secretary general in the context of the related resolutions of the Security Council, but also of a commitment agreed between the parties pursuant to article 5 of the so -called interlocutory agreement of 1995.That, on the occasion of the next negotiations and the definition of the Association Agreement, the European government must be noted by the Skopje government the need to prove an adequate and constructive political will in order to give a decisive contribution to the happy conclusion of the New York talks.I want to hope that such a European application, keeping in mind the difficulties that a possible postponement would cause the completion and implementation of the association agreement, will receive the attention it deserves and will be taken into debt account by the Skopje government in order to respond adequately to the compromise position taken by Greece regarding and in this regard and generally declared by all EU Member States - including Greece - to facilitate and contribute to the journeyof the ERIM towards united Europe.In fact, Mr. President, I do not believe that the regular and harmonious performance of the relationships, contacts and communications between ERIM and Greece, which should be ensured above all thanks to the practical solutions of the interlocutory agreement, can sufficiently satisfy the criteria and conditions of the relationships of good neighborhood, as required by the other in view of the negotiations and the conclusion of the association agreement.	it
.This is a sector where liberalization has shown its limits and serious shortcomings.I am not personally an activist bounded by the monopoly, whether it is public or private ... But when I see the results of private companies in this area, I am comforted and reinforced in my position as a defender of the public service!If continuous liberalization, in this area too, the risk is great to one day see complete regions not served by post.Which can indeed believe for a moment that private companies, the only engine of which is profit, would continue to serve high cost areas except to charge this cost by already disadvantaged residents, and which therefore could not benefit from it.I add that today, when Europe turns out and is unable to oppose the presence of fascists in a government of the European Union, it is no longer acceptable to see us impose an ultraliberalism destructive of public services, on behalf of this same Europe.I am a European and even a federalist.To get there, I was ready, I am ready to make sacrifices ... but not to any price!And above all I am no longer ready to accept the construction of a single liberal market if Europe is not at the same time able to defend the values ​​which founded it and which made me, from the 1960s, a convinced European!The president.Parliament has exhausted the agenda.The minutes of this session will be subject to the adoption of the Parliament at the start of the next session period. 1 Interruption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament.(The session is lifted at 11:10 am) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which had been interrupted on Friday February 18, 2000. Communication from the president dear colleagues, as you know, on February 22, ETA again brutally struck in Spain, with the assassination of Fernando Buesa Blanco, secretary general of the socialist party and spokespersonfrom the Basque Parliament, and Jorge Díez Elorza, his bodyguard.The same day, I wanted to express, in my personal name and that of our European Parliament, the expression of our deep sympathy and our sincere condolences with regard to the families of the victims.These men have paid their attachment to democracy with their lives.I wanted to condemn this act of barbarism unworthy of any civilized society very firmly.The rule of law and respect for rights and fundamental freedoms are the principles on which the European Union is based.Terrorism, whatever its form, is unacceptable.By wishing these men to be the last victims of ETA, I call on this organization to put an end to the use of violence and to use the existing democratic ways in Spain.I invite you, dear colleagues, to observe a minute of silence in memory of Fernando Buesa Blanco and Jorge Díez Elorza.	fr
Resolution on women in the decision-making process (B5-0180/2000) my group abstained on the resolution on women in the decision-making process, to our great regret.But he regrets even more than such resolutions are always necessary.In 1994, the group of Greens was the first group of this Parliament where women were in the majority, it was the first group to have a female secretary general, Dominique Voynet, now French Minister of the Environment, and the German Greens were the first political party to apply equality in matters of sex in order to correct the global sub-statement of women within political institutions.Since then, this initiative has been followed by certain parties and it cannot be said that voters have risen to condemn these parties of their actions.Voters also did not feel manipulated by such quotas.The resolution clearly says that the proportional system, which allows the representation of women, is necessary and that political parties must act in this sense.We are delighted.We understand with those who argue that people should be selected on the basis of their merits;Which is true.Our culture should allow a balance between sexes and people should be able to develop their talents whatever they are, but for the time being, our culture and our values ​​do not reflect this conviction.Prejudices, clichés, are very widespread.We will hardly be surprised that people from minorities, whether black, homosexual, disabled, etc., are the subject of discrimination and inequitable treatment if a majority group, women, must also undergo this discrimination.Our group therefore supports positive action, it is only when women are fairly represented in the decision -making process that men will also be fairly represented.We should therefore also create a culture where your paid and not paid work, your salary, your parental leave and your pension do not depend on your gender..While International Women's Day is fast approaching, I wish to reaffirm my support for action carried out within institutions and member states with a view to promoting the accession of women to positions of responsibility, especially in politics.This is why I will vote with conviction the text of this resolution which urges us to take more proactive measures to fight the discrimination which persist and prevent women from occupying the place that returns to them in our society!The promotion of women in the decision-making process has been one of the priority areas of the European Union program for equal opportunities and is one of the repeated commitments of the Union institutions as well as Member States since 1995.However, if in recent years, progress has been made thanks to strategies such as mainstreaming and additional measures such as positive actions, they are too few to be satisfactory.The underlying representation of women in politics, for example, continues to be a reality.However, we know the importance of seeing many women engage in politics.	fr
This is terrible because the Windward Islands are one of the smallest and most vulnerable ACP countries and will be the ones that have to pay the highest price for this new Lomé agreement.On the other hand, in terms of trade, the WTO has pressed us to ensure that the new Lomé agreement is compatible with its interests, which has caused a huge impetus in favor of the so -called regional economic association agreements or free trade agreements.It is possible that the most developed ACP countries are victims of great pressure to accept these agreements.However, it is very clear that, even after an adaptation period, some countries will not be able to open their markets to the cold winds of free trade without their inner economy going to pique.Therefore, we have to be especially careful to ensure that authentic options are being given to countries that are not yet prepared for free trade agreements.We must guarantee that strategies are really being sought to promote regional integration within the ACP.Finally, when any other summit on trade is held, EU countries and ACP should press jointly to achieve the reform of article 24 of the GATT to explicitly anticipate the non -reciprocal regional trade agreements between groups of countries with structural and economic differences.The Lomé Convention is a unique partenariat in the world;But so that it is really effective, it is not enough only with the debates framed in its context, we must have the collaboration of the WTO and participate in other international negotiation forums.Mr. President, I want, in this debate, to denounce the fate reserved to those poor countries in Africa, the Caribbean and the Pacific of which some dare to say that they are beneficiaries of the Lomé Convention.Even in the mere plan of commercial relations, the Lomé agreement has not protected those countries whose share of participation in trade with Europe, already restricted, has been reduced by half.This reflects the growing inequalities between EU countries and ACP countries.The Lomé agreement mainly favors some large industrial or financial groups that continue to plunder those countries and perpetuate their economic dependence, particularly with respect to the old colonial powers.As for the aid supposedly dedicated to development, it is obvious that they do not serve it, since the underdevelopment of most of those countries is deepened instead of being attenuated, and that when those aids do not constitute a subsidy disguised to the European export industrialists.These aids are first and foremost a providential gift for regimes in power, without the poor majority of populations obtaining some benefit from them.Even if they were duly reoriented, they would be insufficient to finance the essential infrastructure in health, education or drinking water supply.For several years, the great powers decrease the amount of these aids and in itself.The height of cynicism is that sometimes they do it under the pretext of non -observance of human rights, or corruption.But who protects those regimes that favor corruption, not to be the governments of rich countries?Indeed, we turn a blind eye over the main corruptions, those large oil groups, water supply or public works, against which they could act rigorously since they have their headquarters here, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe, in Europe	es
Within three weeks, I will be in Paris and I will continue, capital after capital, participating, from my position, in that dialogue.I consider extraordinarily positive - and I wanted to thank him - that his lordships have adopted this initiative.Secondly, I would like to thank the Portuguese presidency, and, in particular, Mr. Seixas da Costa, his voluntarism.For the rest, what has said before expresses that voluntarism and that interest: the Portuguese cannot be an intermediate presidency.It is the one that will start that negotiation.We know perfectly that it will not be able to conclude during these six months and that the witness will be passed to the French presidency, hoping that it ends before the end of the year 2000. And not only that it ends, but also that it succeeds, which is not exactly the same.Finishing a negotiation is not the same as achieving success in it.The witness will be transmitted, but the conditions in which you, Mr. President, and the Portuguese presidency transmit said witness, will be extraordinarily important, as well as their nature.All the work that will be done together, in particular, the one driven by you, during these months, is extraordinarily important.We have great confidence, great hopes, in the way that the Portuguese presidency, that of a small country - but not for that reason, it will stop having, but must have great ambitions - will successfully carry out that task.For having listened to Prime Minister Mr. Guterrez, the Minister of Foreign Affairs and you, I have that confidence in the ambition of the Portuguese Presidency and in the form, very voluntary, as will guide that negotiation.In these months you can count on the cooperation of the commission.Finally, I repeat: we will have to make a great effort to popularize the issues of that negotiation.They are difficult issues.They are matters of policy and institutional mechanics that are not always easy to explain.Greater reason for European deputies, ministers, commissioners to spend some time for the explanation before citizens, to public debate.As far as it is concerned, the Commission will adopt initiatives, lordships, to implement and encourage that public debate.Cross -border services benefits In accordance with the agenda, the following reports are carried out: A5-0007/2000 of Mrs. Berger, on behalf of the Commission of Legal Affairs and Internal Market, on the proposal of the Board of Directors of the European Parliament and the Council (Com (1999) 3 - C4-0095/1999 - 1999/0012 (COD)) Relative to the conditions of displacement of workersSalaries, nationals of a third state, within the framework of a provision of cross -border services A5-0012/2000 of Mrs. Berger, on behalf of the Commission of Legal Affairs and Internal Market, on the proposal of the Board of Directors of the Council (COM (1999) 3 - C4-0096/1999 - 1999/0013 (CNS)) by which the free benefit of cross -border services is extendedestablished within the community.Mr. President, Lord Commissioner, Dear and Dear colleagues, I must apologize for the first place since my voice is a bit affected, but as Austrian deputy today there has been much to say and declare.	es
"The news of the last few weeks on the way in which modern technologies allow for interceptions, lead us to greater attention: we would not want the dark scenarios described by Orwell to become an even more raw and worrying reality.Now, this is only the beginning of a great work in the field of law, which must proceed hand in hand with the growth of the Europe we want.Mr. President, for the benefit of Honorable Schulz, I would like to remember that the amendments by the commissions and political groups are admissible in plenary, but not those of a single deputy, by an individual title.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, I perfectly understand the frustration of the colleague of Pietro, who in order to present today the report in question had to carry out a huge amount of work in a short time.Crime in the European Union has had such an increase that one cannot be satisfied with a gradual approach to the problem of judicial assistance in criminal matters.In this case, we certainly cannot be charged to the European Parliament;In fact, it is the governments of the Member States that have restricted the room for maneuver to a minimum, thus forcing the European Parliament to face a kind of mission impossible.We must accept the idea that it is necessary to resort to any means, however modest, in order to improve the judicial assistance system.Paradoxically, I could say that it would be better to speak as much as possible than this relationship because, the more we make it clear that they are only small steps, the more the criminals care their hands and the more the disproportion to their organizations and the serious deficiencies at the level of cooperation between the judicial authorities become evident.I undermine the Council of Ministers to look in the face of reality, making itself in particular the imbalance between crime and legislation in force.The objective pursued is to provide the judicial authorities - especially to the magistrates, but also to the citizens concerned - the tools to combat crime in compliance with the fundamental guarantees of defense and the basic principles of human rights.Otherwise, our work would be completely useless.It also launches an appeal in favor of greater harmonization of criminal law in the Member States.In my opinion, only in this way can crime with effectiveness and cross -border level be combated.However, until this harmonization has been reached, to carry out judicial assistance it will be necessary to act with maximum consistency.For this purpose, I presented an amendment, according to which judicial assistance can only be granted if it is criminally for factable facts in accordance with the right in force both of the applicant and the Member State requested.The content of the amendment I forwarded is also reiterated in amendment no.43, in which this cumulative requirement is placed.This cumulative prerequisite is essential, given that in my opinion in criminal law it is necessary to respect the principle of legality ""Nothing Poena Sine Lege"".Consequently, any request for judicial assistance relating to a fact hypothetically not punishable in the requested Member State is in contrast with the aforementioned principle and therefore with the fundamental principles of the right of the Member State requested."	it
I hope that this time too the commitment of Parliament is equally intense.Mr. President, during the period of the latest financial perspectives, 1994-1999, which included 13 Community initiatives, the Transfrontier Interreg II program proved to be an important initiative.The inclusion in the new return of the 2000-2006 structural funds of the Interreg initiative constitutes, in my opinion, a clear indication of what the Member States of the European Union consider this initiative important.The Interreg I program, for the period 1989-1993, and Interreg II, for the period 1994-1999 have marked enormous success in terms of rapprochement of economic and social development between neighboring member states.Being originally from the frontier counties of northwestern Ireland, I have been a direct witness, over the years, of the important role played by Interreg I and II and I am pleased to celebrate the launch of Interreg III.The executive commission has allocated 67 million pounds to the Interreg III program, to be allocated to the continuation of the transfrontier economic projects between the Republic of Ireland and the Northern Ireland.In the past, the European Union has played an important role in the development of the border county region in Ireland: with its 80 million pounds, the union is the largest taxpayer at the International Fund for Ireland.The Union pays 75 percent of funds intended for the peace and reconciliation program.All in all, Interreg, the International Fund for Ireland and the peace and reconciliation program have played an important role in the current peace process.Mr. President, I will intervene on Interreg by limiting myself to some critical aspects, also to obviously respect the time limits of my intervention.We all expressed a positive evaluation of the confirmation of this program and on the extension of the intervention areas, in addition to cross -border cooperation, on the side of transnational and transregional cooperation.This does not prevent us, however, to be aware of the fact that most of the resources - from 50 to 80 percent - will be reserved for cross -border cooperation, to the Volet A of the Interreg III program;The choice then, which was made, to consolidate the current areas of cooperation on this vole, as regards the choice of eligible regions, we continue to believe that it is wrong and contradictory.We hope and hope that on this the executive commission wants to dwell and recognize in substance, and not with a formal tribute, the position of Parliament.The cross -border cooperation continues to concern almost exclusively the terrestrial borders and, where exceptions have been made with reference to the maritime borders, these exceptions are not transparent in the choices and often suffer from compensation with other fronts of the community policies.Discrimination is enormously more serious for the islands that live a regional condition that can only be linked to borders exclusively of a maritime nature.This is in line with a discrimination that continues to use ignoring the content of article 158 of the Treaty, with reference to the insular regions as regards cohesion policies.Even more serious is that this happens ignoring the new data linked to the address that has taken place with the expansion process towards regions such as Malta.	it
If so, they will also be willing to decide to support an extension and participate in it.Mr. President of the Commission, if we are not able to put into practice a solidarity already proven between the rich regions and the poor regions, the Union will be impoverished as a result and will not obtain the support of the population.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, ladies and gentlemen commissioners, lords, the formulation of new programs should not make us forget the old ones that are now in the application phase.From this point of view it will be useful that the commission's work program resumes the issues of the 2000 Agenda, the common agricultural policy, in which fishing is included, and secondly, the activity of the structural funds.Mr. President of the Commission, I hope this reference means that the reorganization of the Commission will not damage the current control and application mechanism for the 2000 Agenda. Of course, the topics of the 2000 Agenda are issues mentioned in its third and fourth strategic objective, the economic and social agenda and the best quality of life.What is not glimpsed in their texts is to what extent the high ones correspond, the generous objectives with the means that the commission will mobilize.And I do not necessarily refer to the economic media.In the end, to apply the 2000 agenda in the agricultural sector, no more resources are needed, it is also necessary to save.These are analytical media: to invest intellectual capital in these issues.Because it is essential to meet two objectives: safeguard the European multifunctionality model in agriculture, and do so facilitating the liberation of world trade from agricultural products, mainly for the benefit of developing countries.It is not easy to combine the two goals.It is not obvious.Possibly there are contradictions between the two objectives and we have no indication that the Commission has indicated these contradictions and how it intends to resolve them.As for the other aspect of the agenda, Mr. President of the Commission, that of cohesion and regional development, of course there we have great achievements to present, but we still have delayed regions, and especially island regions, towards which we should direct our attention.And on the issue of fishing, in its program there is nothing that says that the predatory exploitation of the fish, which in the end has made entire species disappear, will have any type of result in the future.Perhaps it is necessary to pay more attention and more spirit of finals on these issues.Mrs. President, I want to start insisting on the caution that many colleagues have expressed here when referring to this five -year plan.When we establish very ambitious objectives in the long term, we must not take the view of the present.It is an argument that has presented in a very convincing way the leader of my group, Mr. Poettering, in his initial speech.The Union should not assume a whole series of new tasks without having the basic requirement to guarantee a prosperous European economy.	es
First, the new attention that they dedicate to the Mediterranean, of course, fulfills me with satisfaction, be it because the European Union thus contributes to the Middle East Peace process or because the historical and political bonds between the countries of Southeast Europe are continued and expanded.In view of the current geopolitical processes, the limit of the Mediterranean in our opinion is to be used to eat the same importance as that of Parliament and Commission.Second: internal market.As members of the European Parliament, we consider harmonizing the existing civil law provisions essential.Maybe we should gradually deal with administrative rights.In addition, we feel every day how urgently a common law needs, the sources of which are coordinated.Third: Preparation files.I agree with the demand to limit the number of these acts that are presented to the European Parliament several times and from different sides.Although green books, white books and communications - which is certainly very important - contribute to deepening the debate, they also have a complicated and problematic side effect, since they mostly delay the legal measures in areas that are absolutely necessary to act quickly.Last point: In my opinion, two areas were neglected in the Commission program, which the European institutions, especially in view of the increasing spread of electronic business, have to pay special attention.The Commission should submit proposals for the extrajudicial regulation of disputes over the so-called online contracts and to change the directive on contracts in distance sales in order to continuously improve consumer protection.President!As for fishing, I do not want to deal with details of the Commission's legislative proposal.Rather, I would like to receive the clear promise that the Commission will look for a solution to quickly implement the recommendations of regional and international fishing organizations into a community regulation.Already in the previous session period, we had on the occasion of the ICCAT recommendations for the Red Thun in the Mediterranean opportunity to discuss this question of the commission's delays.The delays threaten to become an extremely serious problem, because these recommendations become binding in a certain period of time, but since they are not included in the community legislation, this favors the non -compliance with the measures due to the fleets and can lead to the initiation of violation against the European Union.The hemslock in the implementations is an endemic problem for the Commission.For example, we have been waiting for the ban on landings from Honduras and Belize in the Community regulation since 1996 or, for example, since 1998 for the inclusion of the control of the catch of white thun in the community waters.The Commission constantly accuses Member States that they do not implement the resolutions or guidelines of the Commission into national law while doing the same in the international area.Obviously, the commission proposal about a change in the international organizations is trying to separate both Parliament and the Council from the legislative procedure for greater speed.From the perspective of our institution, the serious doubts raises whether this is the best way to solve this problem.I expect President PRODI to be an obligation here that this question will be solved once and for all and that Parliament is always included in the legislative procedure for taking the recommendations of the international fishing organizations in the Community Present.	de
We no longer have the choice.It's imperative.European citizens will not accept anything lower than the quality of life that suits them as human beings.We do not want the US model - a model that has spectacularly failed to create the use necessary for a decent quality of life.This model has dramatically increased the number of workers poor in the United States.This is not what we want to do in Europe.Solidarity is in the traditions of Europe and we enjoy experience which consists in doing things better.However, we have to seize the tools necessary to do this.This is the reason why I urged that we were setting up the high -level group, as proposed by the Commission, but also that we were going later and that we have a process based on that of Luxembourg so that we have an integrated approach to this issue relating to social protection.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, this is one of the social areas to which the European Union must pay the greatest attention.In fact, macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the nominal convergence criteria have acted as many obstacles to a modernization of social protection likely to contribute to the improvement of the quality of life of the populations, in particular through a significant increase in pensions and pensions -particularly minimums -, and a fight against social exclusion.This situation is particularly serious for countries such as Portugal, where minimum retirement barely exceeds half of the national minimum wage, which is the lowest in the whole European Union.Also, as long as the Commission does not recognize the need to modify macroeconomic policies to create more quality jobs and guaranteeing the rights of their holders, which constitutes the fundamental basis for the maintenance and modernization of a solid social protection system, will be maintained the biggest reserves about its position.Although the Anderson report has integrated positive proposals, including some of those we had presented, it still contains part of the bases that we had criticized in the initial proposal of the Commission and the strategy of modernization of social protection continues to concern us.Mr. President, previously, I directed two manufacturing companies, one in the United Kingdom and the other in the Netherlands.The company located in the United Kingdom developing, we invest in personnel increases and as the company, in the Netherlands, developed, we invest in additional machines.The reason was simply that social costs were too high in the Netherlands.I am in favor of social protection, I am in favor of the original document of the Commission but I do not want to see people lose their jobs because the costs in terms of social protection become unrealistic and too high.This is the reason why I asked, in committee, that an impact assessment on businesses be carried out, so that the costs and risks involved by jobs can be taken into account and the PPE-DE Group supported this amendment.However, I must remember that other groups, led by the PSE group, itself led by my compatriot Stephen Hugues, voted against this amendment.I accept the fact that Mr. Andersson's report is inhabited by the best intentions and I respect him for the work he has done but, in my eyes, the way in which the report defines and promotes social convergence would cause an increase in social costs throughout the EU.	fr
Finally, we ask that methods and relationships used for the disbursement of funds change.A greater involvement of the private sector is needed, which will introduce a perspective of financial realism in the financing project.In addition, the type of projects that are financed must be changed.No more reduced scale projects that aim only to income, and that are difficult to check, instead it is necessary to switch to vast scale projects, whose benefits in most cases are evident.In this way, the need for transparency in the use of these resources will be faced, whose a lot of talk is made, while contrasting the temptation to pull unnecessarily for long by continuing to absorb the money of local taxpayers in the areas where the projects in question is located, while the European Parliament will prove to take the need for reform very seriously.If today the classroom will support the changes to the report I have illustrated, I believe that we will be able to move on to the next phase, that is, achieving the historical objectives for which the funds have been established, that is, to provide assistance - financially sustainable - to the poor areas of the European Union that need a dignified level of life, not so much making them alms but giving them a push forward.I invite the classroom to vote in favor of the changes I presented.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, I want to congratulate the rapporteur for the work done, a serious and complete work.There is no doubt that structural policies and European Union's cohesion policy represent the essential tools to create conditions suitable for the development and reduction of economic and social inequality between the various regions, since disparities, despite the efforts made, remain high, and inadmissibly raised in the context of unemployment.To ensure a greater achievement of the objectives of these policies, it is essential to ensure coordination and organization on the basis of guidelines developed carefully and, we allow me, with intelligence.It should not be forgotten that these policies, when they are effective, are also visible in the eyes of the European citizen who benefits from it, who touches a direct improvement in his quality of life with his hand.It should not even be forgotten that it will be necessary to pay particular attention to the insular and ultraperiferous areas of the Union, which clash with enormous obstacles to their economic and social development due precisely to the geographical position;Provided that, of course, the commission has no intention of building bridges and digging underwater tunnels to connect them to the rest of the continent.In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that structural policies as a whole require greater flexibility, in order to be able to adapt more easily to changing the circumstances, thus being able to cope with the new challenges and opportunities behaved by the advent of the new millennium, for which we all wish each other the best.Mr. President, undoubtedly the report of Mr Schroedter contains numerous useful observations and congratulates me, but I am the rest of the opinion that, in the face of the guidelines and results of the regional policy of the community, our restlessness should be even greater.In a nutshell, the colossal mass unemployment is not only not attenuated by regional policy, but is even further aggravated.The rural economy and the agricultural regions are in fact affected irreparablely by this policy, with dramatic consequences both for employment in rural areas, and for the level of life of farmers, especially in the European south.	it
"The rights of information and control obtained in the past by the Parliament must now be clearly redefined, according to the Treaty of Amsterdam, by an interinstitutional agreement.Our rapporteur, Ms. Frassoni, has accomplished meticulous work and highlighted the questions which must be clarified within the framework of this interinstational agreement as well as the internal administrative procedures in Parliament which must possibly be modified.The main problem remains the time factor.When Parliament is informed, it must, as a rule, take a position within four weeks, if it wishes.As soon as questions involved the health and security of citizens in the European Union, the Commission, which has the role of guardian of the treaties and which remains the sole institution endowed with the right of initiative, must be able to react very quickly, sometimes in a few days, even in a few hours.However, the law of the European Parliament to information and possibly reaction must be preserved.Compared to these difficulties, our rapporteur offers very useful solutions that my political group can only support.I still have to send one last request.In point 2 of the German version of the resolution project, a passage was ill -translated.I ask for an emergency a clarification on this subject, and this too, after the fact, from the people responsible for printing.Instead of ""must be renewed"", you had to understand ""must be maintained"".This is not so clearly formulated in the German text.I would therefore like to check this passage.Apart from that, I sincerely thank our rapporteur.It is a difficult material and I hope that the way we have tackled it will now allow us to make better use of it.Mr. President, I congratulate the rapporteur for his report.I must add that seeing Ms. Frassoni in such a conciliatory mood and eager to reach compromises with other institutions is a pleasant change.When it comes to the CIG, it is one of those whom the French call ""the pure and hard"": no compromise, not agree with the other institutions;They would prefer that the whole process is blocked rather than making compromises about their position.However, here it is ready to accept the steps forward which were made and which are far from corresponding to the original position of the Parliament on the question of comitology.Let us remember what is at stake in this area.Parliament had four main criticisms with regard to the comitology system as it existed before the new decision of the Council to which this interinstitutional agreement was added.First, the system, as a whole, is obscure.It lacks transparency and hundreds of committees with secrets of the secret day meeting without anyone knowing who sits within each committee.A real step forward was completed in the new system that has been adopted.We will know who sits on each committee.We will know when they come together.We will get the orders of the day.We will obtain the documents sent to them.The whole system will be more open and more transparent - even if it remains rather complex."	fr
Even in member states and in very rich cities, a large number of people live in ghettos, with inadequate facilities, where education is very low, where physical infrastructure is underdeveloped and where drugs and other phenomena are widespread.It seems to me that, for the European Union to prove that it contributes to helping citizens of the European Union, it must help the Member States to demonstrate that the Union works for these citizens and for their families.This program was very productive in Ireland, as it has been, I know, in other countries.It took a long time to start there, but the reason is that the inhabitants of the region had to develop these programs themselves.It is important that they use their own spirit of initiative and their own local skills in the development of this initiative.It would be very easy to ensure rapid development and respecting deadlines if professional experts from the outside were involved, but this would undermine the general objective of the Urban program.I want to make a remark before concluding: we must insist that where the funding is allocated and where this program is developed, this is done as part of a serious urban development policy.Alas, this is not the case with Ireland.I applaud the innovative approach to the Equal program and the objective to integrate discriminated groups into the job market.Development partnerships are a very judicious idea, although they are experimental.However, I have two major concerns about development partnerships.They should be accessible to smaller groups so that they can design, work and control the programs.Programs must be very flexible.I have also expressed my concern in the past as to the use of a simple language and not a jargon, so that everyone can have access to it.I am delighted to see that we have taken into account in this report, but I cannot accept amendment 9 because it is really not written in a simple language.My second concern was that certain discriminated groups encounter specific problems, for example access to people with disabilities at their workplace.Projects should also specifically deal with this problem.These concerns should be taken into account when defining the programs.I, of course, intend to do so with organizations and groups in my constituency, in the West Midlands.I now come to the controversial question of asylum seekers and refugees.Although I am not in favor of the fact that the refugees who have been refused the status of refugees and who were threatened with repatriation have access to Equal, I will support the possibility of access to Equal for all the other asylum seekers and refugees.It is only fair and equitable that they can have access to Equal in the same way as anyone else.Mr. President, my dear colleagues, with the leader report, rural development is in the spotlight.	fr
The umpteenth example is the suppression plan of jobs in Europe of the STAR-ALSTHOM POWER Trust.18 million unemployed, 50 million poor in the European Union, despite being one of the richest regions in the world: here is the result of this competition that European institutions intend to favor.The desire to regulate the conditions of competition on the European market, expressed by the Commission, is ridiculous because the only law to which the competition obeys is the law of the jungle in which the most powerful crush or engulf the weakest.This is reviving especially from a social point of view.The European Commission report shows, crumped that the institutions of the Union are only interested in the great capitalist groups who give themselves to this economic war and at all in the victims that it reaps.Nothing is done to prevent the increase in unemployment, nothing to protect wages, nothing to prevent large companies from pushing a part of the population towards misery, for the sole purpose of further enriching their shareholders!The only merit that we can recognize to this relationship is to demonstrate that the laborious majority of society has nothing to hope for the European institutions to preserve, and even less to improve, their living conditions.By voting against this relationship, we make ourselves spokesperson for all those who have expressed their refusal, in Seattle and everywhere in Europe, towards a world entrusted to pure mercantile logical logical.We vote against this report in the name of the development of public services, and in particular, in memory of the victims of the railway accident at Paddington station, which were killed not by fatality but for the absurd fury to compete in place of regulation.All in all, this report is a primitive text that is inspired only by the law of the jungle, because the competition cannot solve any of the problems that humanity has to face in this century.Whether it is the balance of the biosphere, promoting culture or cooperation with the third world, competition to the bitter end constitutes a factor of regression and insecurity.The 18 million European unemployed, do you think they are victims of an too shy application of this policy of competition?We are convinced of the contrary and we do not even think that state aids are, by definition, too high.Compared to which Ferrea rule, which criteria of effectiveness would they be?Finally, after Seattle, do you consider pre -precline a greater role than the OMC?Only the legal consultants of the multinationals can prove such obstinacy.Jonckheer report (A5-0087/1999) I congratulate the quality of the seventh census of state aid in the European Union, for the now annual character of its publication and for the fact that the general management of competition discloses on its website general and detailed information aimed at the public.I am satisfied with the setting of the rapporteur as regards state aid and congratulate him.Too often, in fact, there is a tendency to stigmatize state aid as measures that false competition.	it
The only way to suppress negative ideas is to express others.I come back to the subject of our debate: I am deeply convinced of the value and democratic power of the debate, especially when it comes to combating demagogy.Mr. Barnier, you emphasized in your explanation how important the dialogue is with European citizens.With regard to the government conference, it is probably the case that the Portuguese presidency is expressly justified according to Helsinki's decisions, to expand the agenda for the government conference during the conference.The parliament is represented with Mr. Brok and Mr. Tsatsos.But, Mr. Barnier, could you promise that you will inform Parliament if the agenda is expanded so that we can deal with you within Parliament and in dialogue so that the dialogue with the citizens to whom you place so great value can be continued?.(Fr) Mr. Beazley, my answer is clearly yes, but it is actually not new.The chairman Napolitano and many members of the committee for constitutional questions and even more MPs here in the plenum know that I am ready to report transparently and at the same time during these negotiations on behalf of the Commission.I may do this in other words as Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, their direct representatives.Incidentally, we will probably do this together in many cases.I think it is very important that these negotiations do not take place without constant information from the European Parliament or the national parliaments, especially since they - as I would like to remember - ultimately have to comment in the ratification process.That is why I welcomed Mr. Napolitano's initiative to regularly vote between the national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament.Regardless of this, the obligation to transparency about the reform of the institutions begins here.I will therefore always be available to tell you about our positions and the status of these negotiations in the course of this year.President!First of all, I would like to congratulate the commission on your approach.I think it is crucial to get into conversation with the citizens in good time, which basically neither happened in the contract of Amsterdam nor in the contract of Maastricht and consequently only sown.Two questions: First, they said they wanted to record the dialogue with the citizens and start with 700 interns at the European Commission.Do you commemorate yourself to the population via the media, including the television and the Internet?My second question is critical.The European Commission has just presented a transparency proposal.If I compare it with the proposal to be used in the Netherlands of legislation, then it is far from being ambitious, and this proposal has already met with violent criticism in the Netherlands.I just want to know how you want to guarantee transparency with a view to the government conference, because the now available guideline does not offer a good example.	de
The question of UCITS may seem difficult, technical and fairly risky on the political level.In my opinion, not everyone knows what UCITS represent.However, allow me to highlight with force that this question really concerns European citizens, because it is a question of knowing how their savings will be managed, what are the existing choices, how inter-community competition will work with regard to the different types of savings, if savers are entitled to a certain security as investors, and what possibilities are available to European citizens to prepare their old age.It is also a question of weighing the demand for liberalization aimed at making the market more effective and increasing the profits against the need to protect investors.During the 1980s, most of the markets were the subject of radical deregulation, which had the main consequence of the very rapid development, in a few years, of national financial and bond markets.Collective investment funds have established themselves as an alternative solution to individual banking savings.Sixty percent of the Swedes save through various investment funds.This type of savings provides the investor security due to the diversity of investments.The capital market and the bond market continued their boom.The OCCVM directive in force has become obsolete.New types of investment funds have been introduced in different countries, but the UCITS concerned are not allowed to market their shares in other Member States.This restriction hinders, of course, competition and innovation, and limits possible choices for the public in savings.The proposal of the commission which we deal with today includes two components.The first concerns the products, that is to say the investment funds.The second part has the object of investment organizations.The first proposal essentially aims to extend the possibilities of placement for these organizations, by authorizing them to invest in assets belonging to other investment companies, for example, the shares of other UCITS, the long -term financial contracts and standardized options, deposits in credit institutions and certain types of instruments in the monetary market.Special risk distribution rules, based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria, are provided for these investments.The proposal also recommends the implementation of specific rules for the distribution of risks for organizations which aim to reproduce stock market indexes, clues funds.The Economic and Monetary Commission strengthens the requirements in relation to the Commission's proposal.In order to guarantee transparent operation and a healthy situation, investments in non -harmonized funds should only be authorized if qualitative criteria, such as transparency and protection of investors, are implemented.In addition, quantitative criteria should be applied (risk exposure).Allow me, Mr. President, to approach the point which is the subject of a certain disagreement, and which I hope will be overcome later, namely the instruments derived from over.The Commission distinguishes, in its proposal, between the derivative instruments which are negotiated on a regulated market, and those which are not.These are called the instruments derived from over will.According to the commission's proposal, the wranged derived instruments do not enter into the categories of investments that can be possible for UCITS;They should only be used for good portfolio management and risk reduction linked to exchange prices.	fr
It is also a no longer recent communication, which dates back to April 28, 1999, that is, almost a year ago.The document comes from the previous commission and evidently constitutes the fruit of the work that Commissioner Papoutsis carried out during his mandate and which culminated in the Luxembourg summit and in his Philoxenia program, in the failed Philoxenia program.I believe that today is the first discussion that Parliament has with the new commission, with a new manager, Commissioner Liikanen, who is listening to what is said in the courtroom with great attention. I take the opportunity to ask him directly a couple of questions.The first: the intergovernmental conference is starting.At the Maastricht conference in 1992, the governments had committed themselves to inserting a legal base in the treaties;This commitment has not been reflected in the 1997 Amsterdam Treaty, it is therefore a still pending commitment and there is even a resolution of the Council of last June on tourism and employment.What are the expectations of Commissioner Liikanen regarding the insertion of this aspect in the new intergovernmental conference?The second question is much more direct and probably more demanding: in light of the failure of the efforts made in the last decade, as Mr Koch underlined, commissioner Liikanen believes he could use himself during his mandate so that this common dimension of tourism can be subject to his own policy, taking into account the importance of tourism in creating employment, as all the previous oratories noted have detected?The new Commission will present new initiatives to ensure that, through the continuous effort of the Commission and Parliament - a bit like the drop of water that digs the rock -, can the advice of the need to do something in this subject can be convinced?Mr President, Mr. Commissioner, first of all I wish to congratulate the speaker, honorable viceconte, who has thus widely spoken of the concrete possibility, for the fifteen states of the union, to increase jobs through a wise policy, a wise initiative of the European Union in this field.Just this afternoon we debated the problem of workers suddenly unemployed and at this moment, however, we have the hope of being able to solve these problems.Tourism is a purely and essentially activity of the European Union.All European states are known in the whole world for being the poles of tourist attraction envied by everyone, including the United States of America, of which we spoke this afternoon for the question of the Indians.I would like to emphasize a point of the viceconte report that I approve and subscribe particularly and on which I would like our assembly and the commission to reflect and then give a favorable response.It is the point relating to the third age tourism.Usually I see the Commissioner Diamantopoulou who tears his hair one by one, desperate because the elderly live too long, what causes problems in the field of payment of pensions.In this case, however, the fact that we live longer involves that there is more old people.Not all, unfortunately, but many travel the world to see the existing wonders and to learn, to know more: the Italians to see how the British are made, the Greeks to see how the Turks are made, the French to see the Italian cousins.	it
"I find inadmissible that, within the fishing commission, an official of the European Commission has dared to publicly affirm that the financial means offered by the Commission to some scientific bodies allow to control its conclusions.It seems to me to be a very serious distortion: it is obvious that the commission cannot and must not arrogate the right to guide the conclusions of scientific experts in order to be able to apply the policy that he considers most appropriate in view of his interests only.As regards the reduction of the pressure exerted by resource fishing, it is important to emphasize the international character of this obligation.In fact, what would be the purpose of reducing our European fishing fleet if, in parallel, third countries should continue to exercise pressure on the resource to the atieutics?It must be said, among other things, that the development of the globalization of commercial exchanges involves a considerable reduction in the effectiveness of the controls and the surveillance of fishing activities.The transitions have become very widespread practices and it is not uncommon for the fishing products of a Member State which, due to the overcoming of the CT, cannot be sold in the Union are marketed as imported products or from another Member State.The latter case is very frequent for companies whose capitals have been provided by a member state other than that of the flag of the fishing boat (it is, in fact, an abused form of ""share-Hopping"").Food safety on sea products also plays a fundamental role.It is necessary to preserve the positive image of the product of the sea and prevent insane food from being marketed in the European Union.The deputies of the Union group for Europe of the nations will therefore vote against this report that does not specify at all the gaps in the communication of the Commission and which increases the constraints imposed by Natura 2000 to the fishing sector.The vote is closed.Interruption of the session declares the European Parliament session interrupted.Setting of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, interrupted on 2 March last.Lady president, I am referring to a fact that occurred after the last round, to be precise to an audition of the Commission for women's rights: the good name of this Parliament was risked, when it was stated that in the Strasbourg area there is a massive increase in prostitution in coincidence with the rounds.I warmly hope that the city authorities are asked to check if it is criminal activities, perhaps understanding the trafficking of women and the obligation to prostitute themselves.I think it is very urgent to clearly report our concern to public opinion;The European Parliament cannot remain indifferent to the news circulating about what would happen on the margin of the plenaries.Thanks, honorable Gröner.I would like to tell her that I was also truly amazed when I learned it and that I immediately wrote to the mayor of Strasbourg to shed light about it.I fully agree with the observations that she formulates, so much so that I even anticipated your request.Of course, I will keep it aware of the answer that Mrs. Ries will not fail to send me."	it
I believe that the Council of the European Union has brought, over time, obvious evidence that this is not its position.The decisions were made with a great sense of responsibility by the Council.What happened in Helsinki is very clear.Our relations with the Republic of Cyprus in its process of adherence to the European Union constitute an element that the authorities of the Republic of Cyprus recognize themselves as positive.Do not indulge or try to engage in second readings of our intentions.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to sincerely thank you for this debate, which I generally felt as encouraging and which shows that this assembly largely approves the policy of the Member States and the Commission.However, I would like to provide the clarifications that have been requested.First, with regard to the 4 and 7 sections, it is very simple: in Berlin, for the big package of the 2000 agenda, we created a special section, the famous section 7, for the candidate countries of central and eastern Europe, and only for these countries.Malta, Cyprus and Turkey have not yet been planned.Our colleague Schroedter described this as a lack of consistency.You may have to ask the president of the council of the time, who is not far from you, madam, how we arrived at this so-called lack of consistency.I also participated a little.I do not believe it, but this decision was motivated by the fact that one wanted a particular instrument for the states of central and eastern Europe, which do not know the same conditions as Cyprus and Malta in the adhesion process.I said that I understood the arguments put forward here and the commission will strive to take into account these wishes, but, as it is the 2000 agenda and financial prospects, we cannot act without modifying these financial prospects.This has obviously not been possible until now.To be clear, if we pass this from section 4 to section 7, there will be no impact on the overall balance of the budget.If we do this, section 7 would increase in proportion to the decrease in section 4. It is impossible to add it to section 7, leaving it as it is section 4. Parliament cannot spend money that it does not have, unless you have a press in the cellar to be able to print tickets in euros!Regarding the peace process now in Cyprus and the link with membership negotiations, I would like to repeat that membership negotiations have always had a direct relationship with this.The Commission and the Council have always endeavored to hire the two Cypriot communities on common projects.As you know, it has not succeeded until now and I am asked if there are premises.	fr
But even fifty years later, we fail to prevent genocide.Therefore, far more attention to monitoring and conflict prevention must be used.The monitoring of weapons trade and better control of the media are of essential importance.Human rights policy is also too selective.The months of NATO bombing in Kosovo and the mediation efforts in the Middle East are in a sharp contradiction to the indifference of the international community towards the conflicts in Africa.I cannot defend myself with the impression that Africa, when it comes to human rights, despite all the rhetoric, on the agenda of the Portuguese presidency, is not at the top.I deeply regret that.It is not without reason that the Africans have the impression that they are inferior earthlings.I would like to warn of the standards of the human rights situation in Africa, in which people are regarded as something inevitable in the assessment of the human rights situation in Africa.Human rights policy is above all shattered.We succeed within the international community and also in Europe to define a common strategy.Let's take the Sudan, for example.The international community sends contradictory signals to the country.Great Britain opens its message again in Khartum.Canada invites the Sudanes to peace talks.Europe urges the rebels in the south to negotiate, and at the same time the Americans areolating the regime and supporting the rebels militarily.More coordination is required, more information exchange and a more coherent procedure in which each is avoided.Only then can we consistently follow the founders of the general explanation of human rights.Mr President, if we could solve problems with words, we could pack all of our things and go home.Unfortunately, even at the moment we speak in the protected room of this house, human rights are violated all over the world.Sometimes we hear the more the more we speak - applications: words;Contracts: words;Conventions: Words -If we are not careful, the words will take the place of real measures.Words in comprehensive and liberating documents become contracts and conventions that are often presented as evidence of respect and compliance with human rights in a country.Words alone, spoken, written or signed, are not enough.Let us take a look at the signatories of the Convention on Human Rights and the Treatment of Minorities, and then we compare how such minorities, groups or individuals are treated.The result is shabby and shameful.Can someone say with conviction that women are treated fairly and equally that children have human rights that people are not discriminated against because of their religion, faith, gender, disability, their age, their sexual orientation, their opinion, political conviction, etc.?Discrimination is reinforced by the defamation of minorities in the press and other media.Even in the EU, citizens are still exposed to human rights violations, and here too it is violated by our conventions.Every day, false information and false interpretations are used in the press to withhold certain minorities from the law and disparage ethnic minorities.It can be said openly that a hierarchy of oppression has been created.	de
President!First of all, I would like to congratulate Mr. Solana for this March 1st, where several structures came into force that are related to the European security and defense policy.However, I wonder how he himself is.There is talk of good cooperation with the high representative in the documents.You have just said that you spoke to you at lunch, yes, it should be added that you have not spoken to you and that there are no good cooperation between you and the new structures.But do you not suffer from the fact that you do not conduct the chair there and do not form the focus yourself?I - and I still think some people here in parliament - would welcome it if they were the engine of this matter and did not run the risk of being pushed a little off.The high representative, Mr. Solana, and Commissioner Patten, have tried to demolish a demarcation between the EU's defense policy and that of NATO in the past few months.One actually has the impression that both consider the Petersberg tasks to be suitable to be permanently included in an EU defense policy.The contracts also indicate this direction, but also leave even more scope towards a more general defense policy, which is more likely to coincide with the old statements about the integration of our politics into a European pillar.We would then comment on this European pillar in NATO.I actually hear less and less about it.I have the impression that the European Union has limited its ambitions to the Petersberg tasks, with Mr. Patten then responsible for civil affairs, including the quick-to-use units of police officers and civil servants, about whom he was entirely enthusiastic about the military means and the commitment of the military.Both, and I take it for granted, of course work excellently.But doesn't a little more happen now?Isn't something going on now that one says: In defense policy, NATO's role in the collective defense is very highly emphasized?The European pillar, yes, it actually no longer works as such.Europe is limited to the Petersberg tasks.Is it in our intention, to proceed?In addition, there is talk of the integration of the Western European Union into the European Union, but no longer about Article V, in which one is of course directly involved.Then it is about the larger defense tasks and not just Petersberg.Will that be deleted?At the same time, there is also a generally talk of an increase in defense households.I think that's right, but in this plea is not strictly differentiated between Petersberg tasks and larger collective defense tasks.I wonder how things develop.In the end, how do the two gentlemen see that?Do you have to pay more attention to this topic at the government conferences, or can this be resulted in the contracts?I welcome the fact that an opening arose here with regard to defense policy.	de
Therefore, I consider that the aid to the actions by the environment through the financial instrument Life guarantees the promotion of community policy in the environment sector and contributes significantly to the fulfillment of the community's mission by a high level of protection and improvement of the environment.Mr. President, I want to start my speech congratulating Mrs. Lienemann for the great sensitivity demonstrated to the environment in the two reports we discussed this afternoon.The truth is that two minutes are not enough to address such an important issue.Consequently, Mrs. Commissioner addresses a call to take care of a subject of this draft.For five years, I am responsible for the Environment Commission in another institution that, having regional character, surely does not have a vision as broad as that of this Parliament.The situation of the environment is very, very serious.As the colleagues who have intervened before me have already indicated, I would like to stop once again in the economic problem and in the financing of the projects that, in my opinion, should be public as a whole.Commissioner lady, in terms of financing, 613 million euros are inappropriate.They are also 850 million euros.At the end of August, I participated in a meeting of the Environment Commission in which 2 million euros was even discussed, that is, 4,000 billion liras, for elimination or, at least, the reduction of smoking problems.However, the environment is a much more serious problem, much more important than smoking.I assure you, Mrs. curator, that 850 million euros - always that such financing is really granted - in practice they are not enough to carry out any type of project.In many territories, parks have been built that in the Life program represent an element of fundamental importance.But these are parks built with few financial means, lacking signaling and, ultimately, ineffective and useless.This is why I invite Parliament and the Commission to dedicate great attention to this issue..(SV) Mr. President, dear deputies, the institutions, since the beginning of 1999, discuss the regulation proposed for the third stage of the financial instrument for the environment, Life.Once again I want to thank the Environment Commission and Mrs. Lienemann the good and constructive cooperation in this area.As a result, I can confirm that the Commission approves, totally or in principle, nine of the fourteen amendments approved in the Commission.The commission especially welcomes amendments 1, 2, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 13, on the procedures in the committees.In these cases, Parliament has taken into consideration the objections of the commission regarding the common position.In principle, the Commission also approves amendment 4 that, however, must be incorporated into another part of the text.As for amendments 5 and 6, I want to emphasize that the project for the sustainable use of groundwater and superficial waters and the project for the decrease in pollution that contributes to the greenhouse effect are largely included in Life.	es
I know that this directive can lead to some problems, because during the discussion there has been talk of the different realities of the various countries of the European Union.What happens in the North is different from what happens in the South, and in turn different from what happens in other countries with desertification problems.I know.However, there are certain amendments intended to help the countries of the South, in this case the amendment no.43 which, referring to the recovery of costs, also prescribes that the Member States, in the decision -making process, take into account local social and environmental conditions.There are also difficulties as regards water transfers.In my country, I live in northern Spain, there are great differences between the North and the South, and difficulties arise when transferring the water from one place to another.However, even in the report of the honorable Lienemann it is stated that the recipients of the water transfers must economize and control their water resources.I am aware of the complexity of this relationship and the difficulties due to the different realities of the countries, however we must be able to obtain a picture directive that avoids the repetition of what is now happening in the Danube, or of what happened to Doñana.We cannot allow the poisoning of the waters of Europe, Mr. President, so we must prepare a directive that strengthens the political will of the governments to keep a resource, precious for everyone, like water.Mr. President, I congratulate the speaker for the excellent relationship.As an Irish deputy to the European Parliament, and therefore as originally from a country that has extended reservations of excellent water, I support the vast majority of the proposals contained in the directive.However, I would now like to focus on the disagreements between the Commission for the Environment, the Public Health and the Consumer Policy of this Parliament and the Council, which has already approved its common position on the subject.The Council believes that the objective of the good condition of surface waters should be guaranteed within 16 years by the entry into force of the directive, while the commission for the environment, public health and consumer policy would like to anticipate this deadline for ten years.I do not see why the Member States of the European Union could not apply the fundamental provisions of the directive in the shortest possible time.I now pass to the amendments that will be subjected tomorrow to the classroom regarding the principle of recovering costs for the use of water resources.In the common position, the Council affirms that the governments of the Union must take into account the principle of recovering costs for the use of water resources, without however including in the text of the common position any date for the application of this principle.Amendment n.43 is intended to ensure that by 2010, the policies for the tariff of water services provide adequate incentives for the purpose of efficient use of water.In addition, the implementation of this policy must be ensured through an adequate contribution of the various economic sectors, divided into industrial, domestic and agricultural.	it
In addition to an economic and employment policy, the policy of the European Union also includes a social policy.So far, it has been restrictive both in the approach and the instruments.However, the influence of freedom of movement, the internal market and the euro also leads to integration with labor markets.There are no unmistakable consequences for social protection, which is based on work.Cross -border commuters, parked workers, migrant workers, but also job seekers, interns and students feel prevented from exercising their right to freedom of movement because there are no coordination or convergence at the level of social protection.Incidentally, a similar phenomenon is shown in the tax law area.To combat conflicts of competition and to avoid dumping, the Commission has developed a balanced strategy that finds the middle ground between harmonizing on the one hand and non -interference on the other.On the one hand, there are binding and enforceable guidelines for the same wages or for additional pensions, on the other hand, programs are to create incentives in the fight against discrimination and social exclusion.With a number of recommendations, reports and communications, the Commission has come closer to the alignment, in particular with the objectives specified by it and the establishment of a high -ranking civil servant group.Since both proposals have already been approved by the Council, it is important to contribute this approach in order to then be able to assess with expertise whether, to what extent and how social protection must be adjusted in the European Union.Because expansion, globalization, aging of the population, individualization and new family structures require such an alignment.If we deny these relocations, then we will in fact reveal social protection.In the direction of the euroskeptic and nationalists, I say that social security is not social only within the limits of the Member State and does not offer any protection.For competitive reasons, dismantling social protection also harms social protection as a productive factor.Less social protection means lower purchasing power, deterioration in the state of health of employees and less happy workers.I would like to tell the super Europeans that European social protection is neither feasible nor desirable.Member States differ considerably from each other in relation to funds, beneficiaries, income or benefits, etc.This means that leveling is impossible.The path taken by the Commission is understandable.It is an advantage for them that they can create clarity, record data and exchange experiences in order to agree in further objectives, to create solid comparative standards and to give recommendations.I welcome this view.I would like to encourage the commission in it and hope that we will get one step in this point in Lisbon.Mr President, I would like to join the congratulations of my previous speakers for Mr. Andersson for his successful report.He succeeded in making a broad consensus on a topic on behalf of Parliament on behalf of the parliament, which is not only in this parliament, but practically in every Member State a problem that is sensitive in every relationship.I also welcome the Commission to notify.We had to wait a long time, but the waiting was worth it.It could develop into a milestone in the development of a European system of social security, provided that we take it seriously and do not allow that individual Member States shy away from the steps to be moved.	de
"Even the cumulation of funds from the cohesion fund and the structural fund has not brought the desired success in all regions and countries.After the declared goal of all politicians is the reduction in unemployment across Europe, one has to ask the critical question of whether applied politics is the right one or whether it is not more functional to strengthen the competitiveness of the regions through corresponding measures such as increased promotion of research and development, improvement in infrastructure, increasing the level of training levels?The building blocks of a successful business location are serious structural reforms and a competitive tax and tax policy.If we do not want to put up with the accusation to pursue a cost -intensive structural policy that is not sustainable in the question of employment, the previous measures must be questioned.The Union's structural policy is successful if it succeeds in creating sufficient jobs and the unemployment rate drops significantly.President, Mr. Commissioner, Dear colleagues!My thanks go to the rapporteur to treat this very important topic.After all, the development of the social and economic situation is crucial for how the citizens of Europe evaluate the success of our work.For the EU's credibility, the problems with which people have to deal with every day are of crucial importance.We have to admit that the EU has already supported the development of the poorer countries - in my opinion very generously.When I keep in mind what it looked like in Portugal and Greece when I traveled these countries for the first time 25 years ago, then I take my hat off to the EU or, as the French say: ""Coup de Chapeau"".The EU really deserves this respect.In the countries themselves, however, there are still too big differences between poor and rich regions.What are the consequences?People react by voting their feet and leaving their homeland.For example, we have to build schools, hospitals and the entire infrastructure several times for the same people in the same country.This is a very expensive matter and also leads to major social problems.However, most people would like to stay where they were born if they were given the opportunity to do so, i.e. if they had work.We have to give you this option.It is about a moral duty that is imposed on the EU and all of us.I see a solution in a noticeable promotion of entrepreneurship.I not only understand to own a company, but the will to run a company.I mean an attitude that prompted people to find their way in his life, be it as an employee, entrepreneur or civil servant.What does a just society look like?It is a society in which a person can also progress from modest conditions so that his children have a little easier.This also results in the possibility of a positive development of the regions, because people are involved and work when the conditions are created.In conclusion, I would like to point out that in this relationship we should learn from America, where hard work is still fashionable and success is proof of competence and does not become the subject of envy, as is often the case with us in Europe."	de
For that reason, we have to reiterate them again and again that these two products cannot be compared to each other, apart from the fact that it should be imposed minimal protection.Why do we not guide ourselves for the minimum protection contemplated in the directive on operations with transferable values, for example by article 11 of the same, which refers to good conduct?In my opinion, it is here another advance that we could obtain and I think it would also be good if consumers and investors could get an idea about the risks structure of the funds mentioned from their name.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the proposal of directive we are dealing with brings several reforms of the current regulations that are welcome.In the elaboration work, a bound balance has been found to increase the efficiency and growth of financial markets, without skimping in the proper consumer protection that participates in investment funds.The greater the consumer's confidence in the operation of the financial markets, the more consumers will be decided to invest in the open markets.The more consumers invest, the more promising the financing markets of European companies will be.It is evident that if companies receive more easily financing with their own capital, the balance of them will have more consolidated foundations and, therefore, they will improve the possibilities of growth and investment.In this context, the fact that the increase in capital in the securities markets comes from direct private investment or that carried out by collective investment agencies.Although in the Commission of Economic and Monetary Affairs we agreed, in general, in terms of the objectives of the reform of the legislation, the process of elaboration in this parliamentary commission has not been one of the easiest.At least personally, the technical division of the Directive in two different proposals caused difficulties, a fact that did not facilitate me in any way the familiarization with this difficult specialized theme.In any case, I would like to expose my opinion on some specific proposals.First, I feel very satisfied that the directive proposal increases, as a whole, the freedom of investment funds to channel financing capitals towards different instruments.As for the derivatives, I consider that the position approved by the Parliamentary Commission is justified -contrary to Mrs. Ranzio -Plath, for example.Derivatives not negotiated in regulated markets, OTC, should not be treated in this directive differently from typified derivatives, since OTC derivatives are for current use in many member states and have also been used in the past.With regard to article 5, letter G, of the second board of directors, that is, the so -called delegation article, I believe that the original proposal of the Commission on the regulations that must govern the granting of powers was better than the one that has now been approved in the Parliamentary Commission, and, therefore, support some of the amendments made by Mrs. Villiers at this point.Mr. President, I see two problems in this morning's debate.First, when I arrived at this Parliament many years ago, they told me that when there is a difficult task, it is entrusted to a liberal.Now they tell me that if there is a difficult debate, we know that we will have problems if half of the Luxembourg deputies are in the assembly at the same time -and they are.	es
Perhaps I will explain it differently from Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, who are your direct representatives.On the other hand, it is likely that, in many cases, we will do it together.For me it is very important that the negotiation is not secret, neither compared to the European Parliament nor to the national parliaments which, I remember, will eventually have to express an opinion and take a position in the context of the ratification process.For this I paid tribute to the initiative of the honorable Napolitano in favor of a joint and regular concertation between the national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament.Having said that, the duty of transparency and debate begins here, regarding the reform of the institutions.So throughout the year in progress I will be available whenever you want it to explain our positions and progress of the negotiation.Mr. President, first of all my compliments for the approach chosen by the Commission.It seems excellent to me that from the beginning the dialogue with citizens are faced, because it is precisely what was missing from the Treaty of Amsterdam and the Maastricht Treaty and that generated a great distrust.Two questions.First, she said she wants to establish a dialogue with citizens and will already begin with 700 internships at the European Commission.I would like to know if you intend to contact citizens also through mass media, that is, television and the internet.My second question is somewhat critical.The European Commission has just presented a proposal relating to transparency which is not even the bad copy of the proposal on the transparency of the legislation of which it is discussing in the Netherlands and this proposal in Holland has aroused many criticisms.Then I wonder how to make transparency in relation to the CIG, given that the directive now on the carpet is certainly not a good example.Mr DEPUTATO, Mrs. Minister Maij-Weggen, since we talk about transparency about the CIG, knows how to proceed.The negotiation is starting right now.The meeting of representatives is underway in Brussels and I will try to go there later.The documents will be mostly open, in practice work documents.We will not discuss the media during the negotiating meetings that will take place all the year between the ministers and the European Council, but I have committed myself, not being able to do anything else at the moment, to practice transparency and to account, in the most appropriate instances, of the developments of the negotiation and point of view of the Commission.In thanking you for asking me on this point, I confirm that we intend to use all modern means and in particular television to retort our public debates in the various countries and even on a European scale.We will create a chat line on the internet, we will establish some permanent discussion holes.The commissioners will undertake to respond quickly to all the questions addressed.We will use all these modern tools.But I think we should try to get as close as possible to people.I would like - even if it is probably still a little utopian - that in all regions of Europe a commissioner, a European parliamentarian, a minister participates in public debates, when he can.	it
He has worked out some interesting perspectives that I would like to do in some points a little further.It seems extremely important to me to think about the area of ​​application of the regulation.First of all, a stronger focus of the projects on the restoration of the tropical forests is required.The 1995 Council Ordinance was perhaps too concentrated on the protection of the tropical forests and did not deal with the use of their production potential.In addition, all aspects of sustainable forestry must be included in future community actions.This means that the local population dependent on the forest ecosystems must be taken into account.It should not be overlooked that the necessary active participation of these people in need of support is met with great obstacles: the corresponding forest areas are often impaired by unrest and conflicts as well as the negative effects of tourism, which is all too often presented as a miracle solution, and if they exist, if they exist.Although any production activity is set in some forests, there are also those that continue to fulfill economic functions.This applies to our forests in the European Union, and I ask you, dear colleagues, what community aid was done for our European forests destroyed by the storms in December last year?The goals of the present report are undoubtedly supported, but a real community policy is also required to maintain and sustainable forests..(En) I probably do not have to emphasize how important the tropical forests are for our earth, how great their influence on the climate is, that a large part of the world's biodiversity in these forests is native and what importance they have, for example as a firewood source, for the life of millions of people in developing countries.For these and other reasons, the European citizens rightly expect the community to support measures to maintain and sustainable the tropical forests.Although I speak of tropical forests, however, it is new to this regulation that the scope of the scope of the previous regulation has been extended to all developing countries, so that countries such as South Africa and China as well as the Mediterranean states and the regions of the Middle East are now also included.In the regulation, the regulation explicitly indicates the needs of local communities and the population dependent on the forest ecosystem and the need to take into account gender -specific considerations.We spoke about the environmental regulation earlier, with regard to a number of horizontal questions, my statements also apply to the prescription of measures to promote the preservation and sustainable management of tropical and other forests in developing countries.I will therefore only go into this regulation briefly.With regard to the amendments listed in the report by Mr. Fernández Martín, the Commission represents the following view of the most important horizontal questions.Financial reference amount: The Commission approves the compromise amount of EUR 249 million mentioned in amendment 9 for the period of seven years.Comitology: In principle, the Commission supports change application, but prefers the formulation of change applications 13, 14 and 15. In the amendments, the amendments are proposed that the annual guidelines and priorities are to be adopted in the administrative procedure, while the Council should examine individual measures with a scope of more than EUR 2 million by means of the advisory procedure.	de
The refusal of the Parliament to grant the discharge and the final refusal of the 1996 budget, the motion of censorship presented in Parliament last year for various reasons and the first report of the Committee of independent experts on the reform of the Commission which aroused the resignation in the block of the Commission itself, are now part of European folklore.Those of us who took part in this historic event know very well that there would have been no upheaval if the parliament had not used its power to put pressure on the commission so that it changes its mode of operation.Remember: the Council of Ministers, which is still absent from this debate this evening, approved the discharge for the 1997 and not 1996 fiscal year the same day of the Commission's resignation on March 15.Here is now the second report of the independent expert committee, which we have already had the opportunity to congratulate ourselves and to debate briefly last September.Our greatest concern, at the PPE, is to regain the confidence of opinion.Not all additional in the direction of building a strong Europe will be useless if European peoples have the impression that the democratic system of responsibility is not appropriate for too zealous officials.We will not give in ground under any pretext, land that we have conquered in recent months and which, in our view, acts in the interest of opening and transparency.We are therefore worried about seeing the burst of announcements from the Commission that Commissioner Kinnock has launched in recent weeks, suggesting to put the policy proposals of different types in a white paper.If it shows a wish to act quickly, it also gives the impression that the commission is more in transmission mode than listening.Our concern will be reinforced if the rumor of recent days is correct, namely, that the Commission intends to seriously limit the access of the Parliament to information.This question was, after all, one of the causes of the fall of the previous commission.Haven't we learned the lessons?Knowing that the European Parliament and the European Commission must still negotiate framework relations has aroused our disagreement with the rapporteur when we discussed his report in committee.We could in no way agree with him when he says that it would be humiliating that parliament gives detailed instructions on what he wants in the commission's package of reforms.The less we will be precise in our resolutions, Mr. Van Hulten, the more the commission and your former colleagues on the board will have the opportunity to do what they want.We believe that the many recommendations for the Sages' report should be applied.The PPE-DE-DE Group submitted all the recommendations of the Sages Report in Commission and many of them are now in the report, which has completely changed the nature of the Van Hulten report in committee.We once again proposed a few amendments which had fallen into a committee, in particular, our wish of a revision of the codes of conduct, in particular with a view to including the reference to the merit and the management capacity that you, Mr. Commissioner, agreed to include during the hearings last September in these codes of driving, in particular in the context of appointments and promotions.	fr
First, I welcomed with satisfaction the proposal number 1. simplifies things and updates them.I think that many British deputies will vote against a large number of amendments in the report.We support the Schmidt report on proposal number 1, but we regret that the directive establishes a lot of limitations of the quantity, which limits the ability to distribute the risks.We believe that the best means of moving forward is a more liberal market.Secondly, we consider that proposal number 2 is very confusing.It is difficult to understand and we believe that the Commission would do well to re -analyze it.If more regulation is needed, we think that it could be better achieved through other means than the directive proposed.In particular, we do not agree with the proposal on capital requirements, because if the requirements are too high, they could mean that some companies have to abandon this sector.We ask the commission to analyze these proposals again.Finally, we would like to urge the deputies to vote against amendment 41, in particular, relative to capital requirements, because we consider that they would be very harmful to the sector.Mr. President, Pecunia non olet, Latinos said.The important thing is that money generates more money.This is the only occasion that we converge the interest of economists and that of those who want to get rich and only think of dollars such as Uncle Gilito who has drawn the dollar symbol instead of the eyes, only that in this case the symbol is that of the euro.Here we gather the interest of these citizens and the interest of pensioners who want to live a quiet life.For example, my brother -in -law who has lived in Rome has been a pensioner for a year and since then every day - from seven in the morning when he wakes up until midnight - he controls the march of his investments in pension funds and furniture values.In the future, pensioners are going to arrange - as happens now - of huge amounts of money.Indeed, while young people are without Blanca, older people have accumulated money and, since they want to make it profitable, they have a lot of interest in this directive.If the national governments had a heart - as the European Union has it in this directive - the multiplication of money earned throughout working life, the problem of the pension bomb would have already been resolved.You, Mr. Bolkestein, in your capacity as commissioner, have a great responsibility for the future of the elderly and pensioners, a future that I hope is better once we will have put this directive ready, that is, very soon, as the Sras. Villiers and Kauppi propose..(NL) Mr. President, with his permission he would like to start by thanking the speaker Olle Schmidt and the members of the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs, competent Commission for the Fund, as well as the speaker Brian Crowley and the members of the Commission of Legal Affairs and Internal Market, who would like to thank their intense and important efforts to refine and expand the proposals.	es
"Opinion of a deputy for southern Europe: ""Nevertheless, that is, competitiveness and equality of conditions"".(End of fiction).The deputy who now explains his vote considers positive that there is a community directive on water, but he believes that with environmental dogmatisms we do not build Europe, we do a legislative caricature.We cannot deal in the same way of the countries affected by floods and by drought, such as the Mediterranean countries, and countries subject to a northern rainfall regime.In a completely different order of things, Europe would be not united if in the future it made water transfers impossible between different basins.Once again, we must remember that we are involved in a continental project in Political Union.Drinking, feeding, washing, cultivating ....: water irrigates each act of our daily life.Water wrongly considered an unalterable and inexhaustible resource.Because a gesture as simple as opening a tap seems to flow from source.But the source threatens to dry up .... all scientific studies are now formal: water will constitute the essential issue in the coming years, tomorrow.But tomorrow it will be too late.It is time today to clarify the rules of the game, before being all losers.By adopting the water directive on Wednesday, February 15, the European Parliament affirms its ambition to protect surface waters, coastal waters, indoor waters and groundwater.Europe now has a framework to prevent any deterioration in water quality, promote its sustainable use, protect ecosystems, help fight floods and droughts and eliminate discharges from dangerous substances.It is a rescue buoy launched in water.It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water.Indeed, the ecological catastrophe that rages on the banks of the Danube reminds us, if necessary, that too often human negligence leads to jeopardizing natural resources, such as water.The objective of this proposal for a directive, which dates from 1997, is to put an end to the fragmentation characterizing the legislation on water and surface waters, coastal waters, interior waters and groundwater.It provides a framework to prevent any additional deterioration, to protect ecosystems, to promote a sustainable use of water, to help fight floods and droughts and to gradually eliminate discharges from dangerous substances.Specific directives will then be adopted within this framework.The procedure relating to the development of this text was long.The proposal for a directive was modified twice, a second time in 1997, a second time in 1998. A technical working group made up of representatives of the Council and Parliament gathered in January 1999 to try to bring the positions of our two institutions closer.However, the amendments deposited by the Environment Commission remain numerous.I support most of them.With regard to the calendar and the objectives, the Council provides that the objective of achieving a good state of surface water is carried out no later than 16 years after the entry into force of the directive, the Commission of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy wants this period to be reduced to 10 years."	fr
"The report does not say - but it will have to do it in the future - that the governments of the last forty years of all the Member States have squandered and wasted the capital that the workers had entrusted to them to pay their pensions.Today, the boxes are empty.You have to change the whole system!These governments must resign because they deserve the confidence of anyone, nor elderly people or young people today, nor retirees of 2100, 2200, etc..I will start first by warmly congratulating the rapporteur for the audacity of his proposals!I will continue by deploring the reluctance of the right of this European Parliament which, by adopting a whole series of amendments, emptied my colleague's work!This report is, I recall, based on the committee's annual economic report for 1999, the first published under the Euro regime.It therefore relates to the unified European economy rather than a series of national economies.It was for the European Parliament to seize this opportunity to make imaginative and ""activist"" proposals, to use the adjective used by the rapporteur, in order to give a new orientation to the economic activities of the European Union.Indeed, an observation is essential: Europe has an incomparable potential of economic and social progress which, for reasons which still escape us in part, remains largely unexploited, from which the very interesting suggestions contained in the initial report of the economic and monetary commission to relaunch economic activity by setting ambitious objectives (employment rate of 75 %, recovery of growth ...) and!The initial proposals invited in particular the Council to arrest measures aimed at ensuring full employment while remaining coherent with the stability of prices and the budgetary balance of the entire economic cycle.It is not indeed, as some tend to make it believe, to question the policy of stability adopted in recent years.Measures, in particular tax, encouraging private and public investment, must be adopted.It is necessary to hand over the tranceuropée network program as it was proposed in 1994, launching a large research and development program to give investments the necessary content in terms of innovation.How can we consider that the investment should not serve as a demand management instrument but be made according to its own merits?We must promote better management of working time and the generalization of good practice policies in the Member States in order to increase the degree of employability, especially among the most disadvantaged strata of the active population.Certain measures such as requalification, in the form of lifelong training, prove to be particularly relevant.They should be an integral part of the permanent institutional transformation which will have to support the transition to a knowledge -based economy."	fr
On the other hand, there are also community guidelines, but they are not used or only used to a small extent because there are not enough national inspectors.This must be remedied urgently.A guideline for security in maritime traffic has been in preparation for many years, but it is progressing very slowly.In this regard, an unacceptable immobility and unacceptable inactivity on the part of the Commission can be determined.The date for the submission of the Commission on this essential question, which has been pushed out and is now scheduled for July, must be preferred.The basic provisions must be particularly clear and strict.Let me name only three aspects that our faction considers primarily.First, the responsibility of the freight owners must be clearly determined in the event of oil charges, so that the victims of pollution can be unambiguously asserted.The best precaution for the future is the certainty for the agitation that they will be held responsible for civil, criminal law and financially if they are not extremely vigilant with regard to the safety of the ships they selected.Second, the condition that oil tankers, which are approved for traffic in the community waters, must have a double outer skin, as soon as possible and must not be postponed to Saint Neverse Day.Thirdly, an age limit for the ships that are approved for traffic in the community waters must be determined immediately.It could be at a maximum of 15 years.If it is not possible to say goodbye to a common regulatory framework that is sufficiently clear, strict and consistent, the member states who want to create their own framework of this kind should be justified in order to protect their population and territory, as well as the United States understood the teachings from the disaster of the Exxon Valdez by asking for double outer skin and the older than 20 yearsare, don't let it go into your waters.That is why the United States had prohibited Erika's driving on its waters.If the community had done the same, a huge disaster would have been avoided.This time, let us really draw the teachings from it, Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, even if the emotions of the media and parliament have subsided again.Mr President, Torrey Canyon, Olympic Bravery, Haven, Amoco Cadiz, Gino, Tanio, all these names wake up ominous memories.And now Erika.Which tanker is the next?Twenty -one years after the Amoco Cadiz, this Xest oil spill, the seventh since 1967, proves the irresponsibility of our respective government.Once again our west coast on the Atlantic pays the high price for its inability to react, for their surrender before the multis.It is difficult to understand why the French and Europeans allow what the Americans prohibit, and why Europe, where you are usually so quickly on hand with environmental laws, has left the security of maritime traffic outside.Now we have the result.The Erika, a ship under Maltese flag, a floating wreck that is one of the most dangerous tankers, has contaminated our coasts on more than 400 km, a pollution that is much stronger than in the case of the Amoco Cadiz.As a member of the Loire-Atlantique region, I can unfortunately testify.	de
"At the moment, he has just led to the socialist group because he returns to a decision that was taken extremely clearly at the conference of presidents.However, he does the same thing.We discussed, we were unanimous except the PPE group and the Liberal group and I even pointed out, you will remember my dear colleagues presidents, that the question is not to know if you are for or against the Tobin tax, but to know if you dare to hear what the Commission and the Council think.It is not to ask much.So, I reiterate the proposal to maintain this oral question to the Commission and to the Council to know once and for all the position of these two bodies in relation to this relatively modest proposal, but which would give an important signal to opinion, in particular after the emotion aroused by the failure of the Seattle Conference.We will vote on the request of the PPE-DE Group aimed at withdrawing the oral question concerning the tax on the capital of the agenda.(Parliament rejects the request with 164 votes for, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions) Madam president, I would like to thank Mr. Poettering for the advertising that he has just given this debate.THANKS.Madam President, did we count my vote, which could not be made electronically because I do not have my card?I voted ""for"".Indeed, if we add the two colleagues who came out, we obtain as a result .... Madam President, the Presidency proclaimed the result of the vote.The changes do not have to be.Madam President, during the last vote and I rely on your decision on this subject - on the question of the committee's strategic plan, I pointed out that I was asking for the floor before the vote on behalf of my group.But my request was not satisfied.I will be grateful to you, at the end of this point of the agenda, to allow me to provide an explanation of voting in the name of my group.It is important.It would be useful to record at the report of Parliament the way in which people perceive what we have just done, in the light of their own political analysis.Madam President, I do not want to relaunch the debate but I also asked to speak to express myself as to the request of Mr. Barón Crespo.Me either, you did not give me the floor.I deplore it but the vote was made, the decision fell and we should therefore stop there.I am sorry, Mr. Hänsch and Mr. Cox, I had not seen that you are asking for the floor.However, I believe that the positions are clear and they will be recorded at the minutes.When we will adopt the minutes of today's session tomorrow, colleagues who estimate that the positions have not been well explained may request modifications."	fr
Ms. Palacio spoke in detail about this problem, and I think she immediately launched with a proposal for a guideline to transport dangerous goods, which is absolutely necessary today, namely the approach for a European livelihood.In this regard, it will be able to determine that France is willing to work for regulations during his presidency that contribute to greater security.But after the ecological shock, the economic shock, which numerous colleagues have already discussed here.The shell breeding, fishing, the oyster breeding, fish farming are seriously affected today.Storm damage has also been added to the oil spill in many places.Unfortunately, these branches of employment have been exceptionally damaged.On the one hand, you have to fix the damage and, on the other hand, - which is perhaps even more difficult - regain the trust of customers.In view of this situation, people in Brittany - in the Departments Vendée and Charente - as well as the forest companies in other areas await a sign of the European Union.We cannot at the same time want to put this legislative period under the sign of the rapprochement with the citizens and, given the disasters of this kind, passive and without a concrete answer.I have the words of Commissioner Fischler, who may be the most specific we have heard to this day.There are undoubtedly numerous comments on compassion, solidarity and announcements, but today it is time that a concrete sign of European solidarity follows the waiting.The oil spill due to the Erika shipwreck is only a case in a long series of disasters in the waters of the community in recent years, including oil pollution from Braer ahead of Scotland and the Sea Empress in front of the Shetland Islands.These dirt not only led to irreparable ecological damage, they also had devastating effects on the local industries.The accident of the Erika has severely damaged the local fishing and aquaculture sector, and in addition to the damage visible today, the long-term consequences of oil pollution must not be neglected.There must be effective compensation.The security regulations of the community in shipping must be tightened, there must be greater controls, and driving under cheap flags, which can also be observed in the fishing sector, must also be stopped.The ship owners and the owners of the cargo are responsible and must be held accountable for their negligence.The existing compensation funds are insufficiently equipped, as the case of Braer's accident makes it clear, in which the fishing sector of the Shetland Islands was not sufficiently compensated for its losses.We have to learn from the past and ensure that the sectors damaged by the oil spest of the Erika can be rebuilt.Mr President, it is necessary that today, two and a half months after the accident of the Erika, we will again deal with this catastrophe because their dramatic consequences have not yet been overcome.We have to maintain the pressure in connection with the organized people today so that the damage caused as a result of all the damage caused as a result of his rampant aspiration, and at the same time act determined so that such disasters do not repeat themselves.	de
"I refer, for example, to the restructuring of the company ABB-Asthom Power, of which an important delegation of employees from all over Europe is today in Strasbourg.The ABB-Asthom Power Directorate, which is the result of a fusion carried out in June 1999, has already announced a restructuring with perspectives for reducing jobs in several countries.This disastrous situation for employment raises numerous questions, in particular, about the information provided to the European Company Committee, which exists since 1996. It requires an update and intensification of the community directive on the European Company Committees.It also demands a control of the concentrations that takes into consideration employment, the environment and consumers.The report of the Commission of Economic and Monetary Affairs is insufficient from this point of view, which is why I have refrained.By pretending to apply the principle of subsidiarity at the level of the community competence policy, the Commission delegates in the national authorities and courts the competence in the field of decisions and abuses of the dominant position with respect to agreements of companies that create distortions of the market, although they continue in the notification regime issues of concentration of companies and state aids.The now adopted position is aimed at creating more expedited forms and with lower costs of application of the competence policy, which goes to apply community law at the level of the national courts and not at the level of the European Court of Justice and even speak of the possibility of specialized courts.This partial renationalization of the competence policy could have greater costs for the Member States.On the other hand, as the rapporteur recalls, many times, on behalf of the competence policy, public monopolies have been replaced by private monopolies with the privatizations of important sectors and public companies, as has happened in Portugal, with negative consequences for the country and for workers..(FR) The White Book of the Commission on the modernization of the rules of application of articles 85 and 86 of the CE Treaty (81 and 82 new) certainly does not propose a ""renationalization"" of the competence policy, as some fear in the European Parliament.But in any case, it suggests quite interesting evolution possibilities for the European Union.Indeed, after having taken note of the jam of its services because of the prior notifications of agreements of companies that can twist the trade and for fear that its number will continue to grow with the arrival of new member countries, the Commission proposes the suppression of the prior authorization regime of these agreements and a more decentralized application of the rules of competence at the level of the Member States.The most remarkable, in my opinion, is the signal that this proposal sends us: the Commission anticipates the consequences of the extension and includes that it implies and almost mechanically a reform of the centralized system.Of course, in this case, the reform consists in favoring flexibility and not in dismantling.On paper, the commission will keep the control and central direction of the new system.On the other hand, the Von Wogau report, which the European Parliament has just approved, encourages it in this regard."	es
"The European Union water policy does not start from nothing.Numerous directives have been approved and, otherwise, the commission warms the willingness to become more legible, more compatible with each other, with clearer objectives.Thus, it has been an interest in rationality that has led to the formulation of this directive.But our Parliament, in the first reading, insisted that the current directive was not only compatible with the commitments we have contracted -tipo Ospar-, but also allows us to invest the course.Well, despite these numerous directives, despite frequent statements about the effort that must be made in water protection, when we examine the state of the environment in Europe, we see that the objectives have not been achieved.In many cases the situation has deteriorated and, therefore, we cannot content ourselves with an effort to rationalization of the texts.We must set objectives at the height of the imperatives that we face and do not have much time, because, if we do, as the commission proposed, with too long deadlines, when she herself and the council have re -extended the deadlines, we will not only have a credit problem in the opinion, but also, in addition, the efforts will be left - after we know it - for tomorrow and tomorrow they will be postponed again and, therefore, the objectives will not bedesiredI insist on this aspect, because it should not be expected for the umpteenth time that every day catastrophes will be communicated in our newspapers to say: ""Ah! Europe has not acted. Ah! Europe should have acted"", and then, with precipitation, do as if we were going to fix the problems that we did not want to face to the arm in useful time.The example today of the Danube, of the pollution that is taking place in Romania, shows very clearly that, if we do not apply a new mode of economic development, clear demands, precise controls and measures on the state of our rivers, not only will it be reproduced - we know it - that type of incidents, but also will multiply over time.We also know that, if we do nothing, the development of our agriculture will continue to be done with great imbalances.Now the Breton rivers of my own country are in the middle of eutrophication, which harms tourism.I would simply conclude, Mr. President, saying that imperatives are clear in second reading.Do we want, yes or no, rules compatible with OSPAR, that is, to approach zero in the case of hazardous substances?Do we want to reduce the deadlines that the Council has proposed for this directive?Do we want to have a price policy that gives all public and private agents the ability to decontaminate, to act against pollution and save our water?Do we really want to respond to the aspiration of our peoples?Most amendments voted by the Environment Commission respond to that goal;I hope you get the support of the Assembly.Mr. President, ladies, Mrs. Lienemann has just exposed the importance of water and air for us, especially as a simply essential foundation of human life."	es
"In particular, as agreed within the ""Human Rights"" Council on February 9, 2000, the European Union intends to present resolution proposals on the territories occupied by Israel, on Iran, Iraq, Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the Burma/Myanmar, a proposal for the declaration of the Presidency on Colombia and, if possible, on Timor Est, as well as a proposal for the situation in the various countries.The European Union will continue, at the next meeting of the ""Human Rights"" group in March, the discussion on the preparation of the 56th session of the Commission of Human Rights.It will be discussed in particular of the question relating to the possible presentation of a resolution proposal on the death penalty.So far the group has not come to an agreement on the strategy to be used in facing this question and, especially, on the formulation of the commitment to be assumed ultimately in response to any changes of the opposite sense, including paragraph 7 of article 2 of the UN card, which refers to the question of sovereignty.We tried to obtain a preliminary consent on a compromise text, given the difficulties that arose within the 1999 session of the third Committee of the United Nations General Assembly in which the position of the Member States was divergent with respect to a change with which a reference to paragraph 7 of article 2 was introduced in the proposal for resolution sponsored by the European Union on the death penalty.Last year, in the 55th session of the Commission of Human Rights, as is known, the United States decided, in the already very advanced phase, to present a resolution proposal regarding China.This proposed resolution was rejected thanks to a Chinese motion of non -interference.The European Union voted against this motion.The position of the European Union on the attitude to be assumed against China in the Commission of Human Rights was reconfirmed by the ""General Affairs"" Council of 21 March 1999: no initiative of the European Union compared to China or any support for a resolution on China, the European Union vote against the motion of non -interference.It is not certain that the cohesion of the European Union could have been maintained if the resolution had been subjected to vote.The United States of America will present a resolution proposal relating to China of the 56th session of the Commission of Human Rights and are pressing for the European Union signing this proposal.This circumstance has caused lively reactions from China: Chinese authorities are soliciting the countries and institutions of the European Union so that they abstain to support the initiative of the United States of America.The initiative is under discussion within the Union, but a decision is not expected shortly.It is the interest of the European Union to maintain, as far as possible and in any case until the end of the meeting that will take place on February 25, 2000, all the alternatives in the context of the dialogue between the European Union and China on human rights.In light of the changes that occurred in the composition of the Commission of Human Rights, the result of the vote on the motion of non -interference will be expected to be very uncertain.Consequently, it is important that this year the countries of the European Union also reach a consensus on the position to be taken as regards the possible vote on the resolution."	it
Maybe commissioner Kinnock could already make some anticipation tonight?Mr Van Hulten, my group of environmentalists and regionalists in short will support the attempts to further improve the report during the plenary tomorrow afternoon.In fact, it has no sense to resume the numerous and valid recommendations of the Committee of independent experts in the word by word.Therefore, if tomorrow we will vote against some amendments or paragraphs, it is not certain because we are against the content of the text.Our intent is to make his relationship more readable.In any case, it must be clear that my group fully supports the recommendations of the Committee of independent experts.However, I await with interest to see the document approved today by the Commission as well as the White Paper which will be published in February.However, I must communicate to you, Mr. Commissioner, that both the report of the essays and the Van Hulten report will become for our group important points of reference, which will allow us to confirm or deny our trust in the Prodi Commission.I allow myself to be a last consideration.We ask that the new White Paper on the Commission reform receives the same treatment reserved for that on food safety, which was published last week and made accessible to the public and which established a concrete deadline.I believe that it is a necessary step since public opinion expects a change.In any case, my group asks that a real change materializes by the end of 2002. Mr. President, this report is undoubtedly appropriate, but alone it is not enough.Fraud, bad management and nepotism are not random phenomena.They have more possibilities to take hold where democratic control over finance is limited.Much of the European budget is distributed through structural funds.Such an operation makes sense only if marked by solidarity, when rich countries contribute to creating income and development in the poorest countries.The funds thus distributed find the way to return to rich countries passing through Brussels.The municipalities and regional authorities consider these funds owned by them, but are able to reappear only by investing massive financial and human resources in lobbying and negotiated activities.To any undue use of European funds, and certainly after each fraud, the appeal echoes for even more severe controls.However, not even the most rigorous checks can solve the problem.The only result would be an enhancement of bureaucracy and a reduced possibility of influence and participation by local democracies and citizens in the choices concerning the various projects and their implementation.It would be more appropriate that these funds were donated directly by national governments to local authorities without going through Brussels.In the coming years we will have to reflect on the possibility of replacing the structural funds with a pairing fund used exclusively to support the financial statements of the Member States or the low -capita low income regions.This, perhaps, is the only way that allows you to contain fraud and administrative costs and to strengthen transparency and democracy.	it
A Europe that ensures social justice is an need that has not lost anything of its topicality, since realizing it means first of all to put the fight against mass unemployment and against poverty at the center of the union policy of the union.For these reasons, the realization of this political vision presupposes, in my opinion, also the courage to modify article 4 of the Treaty on the Union which describes the European Union, according to a classic-neolobiral approach, such as an open market economy and free competition.In this same political vision, an important role is due, in my opinion, to article 105 of the same treaty, since the European Central Bank must receive the political mandate once once, provided for by the Treaty, to promote sustainable growth and employment with its monetary policy.Mr. President, the Union group for Europe of the Nations believes that the agenda of the next intergovernmental conference should be respected as it has been defined by the Council of Helsinki, that is, rigorously hinted on the issues related to the decision -making process of enlarged Europe.This agenda must be respected precisely to ensure that, before the expansion, the conference works are carried out effectively and speed.We cannot therefore associate ourselves with the opinion of the European Parliament, nor to that of the Commission, as they are aimed at excessively extending the agenda in the negative sense, or in the sense of centralization and the increasingly tight closure of the European system.My group therefore filed a series of amendments which, recomposed piece by piece, form a real alternative resolution.In fact, we say that the next CIG must work on a more respectful decision -making system of national sovereignty.We regret that the Commission, in the opinion of 26 January last, persist in continuing in the usual direction towards a uniform Europe that extends to the east, a centralized superstated that works with decisions made by majority.Federalists perhaps believe that in this way the unity can be created by force, but this idea is completely naive.On the contrary, in an enlarged Europe, Mr. President, forced uniformation through the abusive use of majority decisions can only lead to the explosion.Furthermore, the centralized European system, as it is developing and properly looming, weakens nations and in this way leds the national patriotism which constitutes the vital center of our will to defense.Europe that derives from it cannot be stronger, but only weaker, since it no longer recognizes its identity and the causes it defends.For this reason we have always said that expansion was possible only by clearly guaranteeing the diversity and freedom of the peoples who form Europe, that is, by adopting a variable geometry based on respect for national sovereignty.We are pleased to see this idea progress in the areas that fortunately are still outside the skills of the European Parliament and the Commission.Europe with variable geometry is Europe that respects national democracies and is based on nations, on national patriotisms and does not persecute them.It is in this Europe that we will find the desire to defend ourselves against external threats and not in the binding and excessively complex decision -making procedures that the Commission intends to propose during the next intergovernmental conference.	it
And when one thinks that a conference will be held soon in Moscow, the somewhat pathetic situation of the presence of the European Union in this process will be evidenced.I would like to insist before the Portuguese presidency that you have to have greater prominence, in which it is time to take over and assume greater presence of the European Union on this issue.I hope that the next visit of the president of the European Parliament to the region, as well as the presidents of the corresponding interparliamentary delegations, allow to initiate a stage of greater initiative and of greater presence of the European Union in this complicated and difficult peace process.Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. Commissioner Patten, I want to express my congratulations for his exhibitions, especially to Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share.Therefore, I will not repeat anything he has already said.I just want to make three observations that are perhaps considered similarly by Commissioner Patten but that for various reasons could not be formulated as open as some deputies have done.First, I think we can be glad of the agreements between Israel and the Palestinian national authority.But we already have enough agreements: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm-El-Sheik.Enough of agreements, what you have to do now is to fulfill them.I share the skepticism of my colleague Salafranca when he says that this week there are bad news from Israel since this last agreement will not be able to comply in the planned time.The second point refers to the restart of negotiations between Syria and Israel.Me parece una noticia muy alentadora.But this week we have news that Mr. Barak is not going to Washington, so they will not be able to continue negotiations.I want to verify very clearly that if the goal heights are returned to Syria, the problem in that region is solved.Regarding the question of the referendum to which several colleagues have referred, we have to reconsider whether to fulfill the obligations derived from international law, a referendum must always be carried out.In Germany they would probably be very happy if it was said that a referendum will be held on payments to the European Union and that these payments will depend on what the German people are willing to pay.It would be a similar situation.The third and final point: the role of the European Union.I want to highlight the extraordinary role that the special envoy has played to this region, Mr. Moratinos, as well as the financing we have made there, Mr. Commissioner Patten.You know that you will always find support in this Parliament, also for your proposal.We will be present when financed.But we must also play a political role and this role cannot be played by Mr. Moratinos alone in this region.Here the presidency of the Council has to act and the Mister PESC has to travel to the region.And we, as the Russians have done, we have to invite the protagonists of the peace process.Then we will play the role that corresponds to our participation and contribution.	es
When it comes to security, my group will always support initiatives that increase security in transport.As recent events have demonstrated, we still have a lot to do on this subject.Mrs. President, I would like to make some observations.First, I want to thank the speaker for his extraordinarily precise and technical work in this report, and secondly, I want to thank the commission for the proposal he has submitted.It is the harmonization of examinations, but in fact we are talking about the minimum requirements.It is a shame in a certain sense.The importance of road transport security, by rail and navigable is naturally very large and, given the international character of transport, the training of security counselors should be harmonized, as well as, for example, the requirements of the future ADR.That is important, but so is the control and there are of course several reasons why we must dedicate special attention.Look at accidents on the road in recent years.For example in Belgium, the Netherlands and some other countries where, having fog, trucks with dangerous goods were still on the route when they should have stopped at that time.O Ships from Eastern Europe docked next to other vessels where there is a more than evident danger situation.In addition, it follows from the investigations carried out in the ports in Belgium, in Finland, but also in Japan, that 50% of the containers with partially dangerous goods are not delivered correctly.In other words, it is of great importance.When contemplating the situation of the security counselors, we see that in some countries it is mandatory to have these security advisers since January 1 of this year.At this time this causes great control problems especially in small businesses, because they cannot pay it.Then, or they will reject these goods or mix them with others and that will cause some problems.Therefore, an evaluation of these activities is being requested in the form of annual reports, business analysis, which could be incorporated eventually in ISO 9002 certificates. The rules are now control.Let me mention a last issue.Regarding control, we have to reach good agreements with the countries of Eastern Europe, because until July 1, 2001, that is, within a year and a half, they will not participate in the treaties on this matter.This gives them a temporary competitive advantage.It is not serious in itself, but what we should do especially is to give priority to the security aspects in the transport of goods by road, by rail and by navigable and incorporate this part of the community heritage as quickly as possible and present it to the candidate countries to adhesion.Mrs. President, in this Parliament rightly pays attention to the importance of transportation security.The growing amounts of goods that pass through Europe, entail risks of which we are conscious and sometimes unconscious, for the staff and for the social environment.	es
"President!""It is miserable in terms of development cooperation between the European Union."" This was to be read in a newspaper article on the Union's development policy in a past week.This assessment is not new.Since we deal with development cooperation in Europe, their effectiveness and quality have been questioned.Hope for improvement threatens to disappear if the Commission continues to refuse to look in the mirror.Why wasn't the critical report on the coherence of development policy published?An important conclusion of this report concerned the contradictions inherent in European politics.In contrast to development policy, European politics is particularly in the areas of trade and agriculture.We do not succeed in making a serious contribution to the development of the least developed countries.This is related to the different views in terms of development cooperation in the individual countries of the Union.We are no longer allowed to consider development and cooperation as an instrument of external relationships, but it is to be assessed as an independent policy area.I advocate a transparent, solidarity and efficient development policy.As long as European approaching to the development problem causes inefficiency and waste of money, it is advisable to assign a greater role to the Member States.Finally, I would like to ask the Commission to send the European Parliament as quickly as possible to the European Parliament so that we too can think about possible solutions.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!I think this initiative is useful and sensible in every respect.As several colleagues have already mentioned, we always experience situations in which there is a great contradiction between what we want to achieve with development and cooperation policy, and what we can withdraw with other sectoral policies that pursue opposite interests in the development of the same countries.We are not only talking about the concrete effects of our joint measures, on tourism, the environment, agriculture, fishing, industry.In general - and this is the worst - we talk about the contradictions between our economic and trade policy measures and our defense policy measures.Ultimately, there are a number of situations that are contradictory.In my opinion, the contradictions in the area of ​​community policies are not quite as pronounced.However, they are more pronounced for certain objectives and industries of some member states.We have to be clear about that.On the one hand, we often accept resolutions about peace processes in other parts of the world, such as recently in the case of Indonesia, a case screaming.Then again we find that some European countries had delivered weapons and war material to them.For me, these are the most serious contradictions in this whole area, they are more serious than those that result from a certain incompatibility of the sectoral policies, which are also available.Of course, we know that there are always contradictions between several policies within a certain country.This is normal.At the level of the European Union, we must also be aware that there will be contradictions between the individual community policies, in this case in development policy.We have to be aware that these contradictions are available and that we have to reduce them as far as possible."	de
"The European Union stressed its total support for the United Nations efforts related to the need for a court to judge former leaders of the Red Jamers.At the same time we greet the continued dialogue between the two parties.I feel comforted by the optimism of Kofi Annan, general secretary of the United Nations, on the possibilities of an agreement about the proposed court.The Commission will continue to raise issues related to the rule of law, democratic principles and human rights before the Cambodian authorities through the CE-Camboya Cooperation Agreement that entered into force on November 1 of last year.It has been very useful to discuss twice on human rights in a couple of days.I hope we have other opportunities, but I trust that in the coming years we have less examples of your abuse.Thank you very much, Mr. Patten.The debate is closed.The vote will take place at 6:00 p.m.Environmental catastrophe in the waters of the Danube in accordance with the agenda, the joint debate of the following resolution proposals is carried out: B5-0164/2000 of Mr. Leinen, in the name of the Group of the Party of the European Socialists, B5-0167/2000 of Messrs. Maaten and Thors, in the name of the group of the liberals, democrats and reformistsB5-0168/2000 of Messrs. Oostlander and Grossetête, on behalf of the European Popular Group (Democrat-Christian) and the European Democrats, B5-0173/2000 of Messrs. Papayannakis and Sjöstedt, in the name of the Confederal Group of the European Left European Left/Left Nordic Green, B5-0179/2000of Mrs. Schroedter and others, on behalf of the Green Group/European Free Alliance, on the environmental catastrophe caused by the dumping of cyanide, from a Romanian gold mine, in the waters of the Lapus, Somes, Tisza and Danube rivers.Mr. President, this week we have debated the framework of the Water.Well, the catastrophe that has occurred in Romania demonstrates once again to what extent it is necessary that we take water protection seriously.This catastrophe has put on the table a series of important issues that affect us as a European Union.We congratulate that the European Union has committed to help decontaminating rivers.It is equally important that environmental awareness is reinforced, both in Romania and in central and eastern Europe in general.For all these reasons, we are glad that Commissioner Wallström has hurried to visit the region, since her visit can result in the benefit of such awareness.After all, it is a country candidate for adhesion and this catastrophe joins the existing concern about whether all candidate countries will assimilate in time the regulations on the EU environment.Who pollutes must pay.I wonder if the European Union can carry this type of expenses to the ""jeans"" of the environment that are manifested in the so -called ""savage east"", benefiting from the permissive environmental legislation of those countries.I would be in favor of that option.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, not every day are the same, but ecological catastrophes, unfortunately, are all the same.There are reasons to be disturbed, once again, for this serious pollution that today affects the fourth wet zone of Europe, in order of importance.The Danube delta is in danger."	es
Similarly, we have to continue providing our help to the economic and social development of Lebanon as a whole.It is necessary to find a solution to the problem of Palestinian refugees this is the largest refugee group in the world, which reaches almost five million a sample of the formidable challenges we have ahead.We have to promote initiatives that increase availability and that improve the distribution and management of the very scarce hydrological resources of the region.Finally, although this is perhaps a matter of fundamental importance, we are promoting closer regional cooperation in various fields, gathering all countries affected in a common effort to face common problems.It has already been evident that the financial resources currently available for the help of the community to this part of the world will not be enough to deal with the amount of the aid that will be required in case of permanent peace.I want to highlight this point.I want to remember the Council again and, if necessary, to Parliament, that we should not continue allowing a fracture between our rhetoric and what we really are able to do.I repeat that a change in the Middle East Policy will require a speed change in the support that is asked and that we are expected to lend.I want to add that we will want to lend it.In recent months and weeks we have made progress, such as Mr. Gama has pointed out before.But, inevitably, it is going to be a hard process marked in difficulties and disappointments.We will do everything possible to contribute to the process to reach a satisfactory result and to face the obligations and challenges that will be derived from such a result.Finally, I will repeat for those who have entered the room in the last minutes what I have said at the beginning of my intervention: that I will not be able to stay here until the end of the debate, in large part because it took for granted that the debate was going to be held this morning and that I have set a meeting on the Balkans for this afternoon.I hope to have the understanding of Parliament.Mr. President, Commissioner Patten has our understanding.I would like to tell him that communications with Madrid are usually more fluid and that, therefore, I hope to see it soon.The statements that we have heard throughout the day on the peace process in the Middle East are very timely in time for the tight tour that the minister, Mr. Gama -also also his absence in the debate -has made to the area, accompanied by other representatives of the Council.The tone of the news that has appeared in the media about the latest events in the area could make us conceive a pessimistic vision of the situation.I honestly believe that an assessment of this type would not conform to the reality of the facts.I share, in that sense, the positive perspectives of Commissioner Patten.I will explain: it is true that the Israeli government has postponed the third installment of the West Bank territory to the Palestinian authority.	es
Commission's communication recommends a greater exchange of experiences, as well as the implementation of a high -level group and benchmarking.In addition, the social protection report must be published each year and be examined at the same time as the employment report.That's good, but that is not enough.We offer a procedure similar to the Luxembourg process.Clear guidelines and indicators are necessary, while Member States must develop methods in national action plans.We are shaping a common model, but keep subsidiarity.This social convergence is a process that will continue for a long time.Parliament must therefore be involved in work - not by entering the high -level group, but so that the representative of the Parliament can follow the work in this group and come with proposals on how to continue the process.The Commission's proposal, as well as cooperation for employment, is based on four major objectives.It is a question of: to make the system favorable to employment, to make the pension plan viable in the long term, to promote social integration and to guarantee a protection of sustainable and high level health.All these points are important.In our report, we particularly highlighted the importance of fighting poverty in the EU and finding indicators as quickly as possible in order to advance in this area.Equality between men and women does not have its own pillar.This is mainstreaming in question.The aspects of equality between men and women must therefore find themselves in the four pillars.We took note of this.We submit a multitude of proposals so that, for example, we go to individual social protection systems, that parental leave gives the right to social security benefits, that the possibilities of reconciling family life and professional life are improved and that basic old age pensions ensure a decent standard of living.These proposals promote above all women.In addition to this strategy of European social convergence, a concrete plan is necessary in terms of legislative work in the social field, as well as proposals for a framework agreement in the context of social dialogue with a concrete calendar.We expect the Parliament to present this in its proposal for a social action program.Social convergence is also necessary with a view to enlargement, on the one hand to strengthen the social model and, on the other hand, to remove the risks of social dumping.The Commission must consider the development of a specific action program relating to social policy in the context of enlargement.We had a constructive discussion at the Commission.We had many amendments, but we managed to agree on a report.The number of amendments subject to the vote of the Parliament is now reduced to fifteen.This is explained by the fact that we have significant convergence.Part of these amendments come back from reading to the Commission and I will reject them.I will also reject the amendments deposited by the TDI group, because I do not think they bring something to the report.	fr
Here the crucial point must be set.I am convinced, revered Council Presidency that this will be designed accordingly under your leadership.Mr. Council President, you have taken from the various explanations that both in the committee for constitutional questions and at the level of the group leader of the European Parliament, which, although did not prevail, to trust Portuguese Presidency and not to increase the difficulties by shifting the beginning of the government conference.I can assure you that last week in the committee, the chair of which I was noted, it was not easy to get there, but in the end we decided to rely on the Portuguese council presidency, and we do not want to lose our bet.They told us about the beginning of their tour through the European capitals and the difficulties of some governments, approval in their countries and thus in their parliaments.I would like to draw your attention to the fact that yesterday we did a very interesting day of the discussion and dialogue with representatives of the 15 national parliaments who were present with expert and committed delegations.It was not about drawing conclusions - which was not possible - but the pronunciation was certainly very encouraging.In my opinion, we have to be vigilant and make sure that the national governments try to gain their parliaments for the ratification of solutions that correspond to the requirements of the further development of the Union, and are not behind supposed resistances of the parliaments in order not to sign the corresponding decisions at the negotiating table of the government conference.In any case, we will strengthen our cooperation and dialogue with the governments of the Member States throughout the government conference.Yesterday was also talked about the Commission, which was represented by Commissioner Barnier, who explained her position;Their efforts were recognized, although different views were represented in relation to the suggestions, as she, Mr. Council, expressed various points of view to my impression.However, it should be emphasized that yesterday, too, many of the danger were aware that the expansion could be questioned the original concept of the construction of a political union, which was also pointed out in an interview that will certainly not have escaped anyone due to the authority of his author, Jacques Delors.Therefore, we have to work on the fact that during the government conference there is really talk of how the democratic foundations of the Union, such as - and yesterday was also talked about in this high house when it came to the situation in Austria - which can be strengthened the basis of the Union of the principles, values ​​and rights as well as the role of the political institutions of the Union, also in the area of ​​economic policy.We rely on the Portuguese Presidency, we rely on ourselves and to the Commission, so that as part of the government conference, all of these questions can be discussed constructively and conclusively.President!Only a strengthened Europe can manage the expansion.Only a strengthened Europe can counter political opportunists who take advantage of dissatisfaction.Therefore, fundamental reforms and therefore an extended agenda for the government conference are required.The Finnish presidency only listened to minimalist governments and unfortunately was not at least accessible to this parliament.	de
We have all heard some of the stories from the building of the Council of Ministers in Brussels.Nor do I see clearly to what extent we will achieve some form of convergence on defense expenses, since some member states spend considerably more than others.And, in fact, some Member States are not oriented towards mobility.They are very static in their military and inadequate forces for that kind of war.Perhaps I could address Mr. Patten and ask, from the point of view of the conflict prevention work that we are going to carry out, to what extent we can examine situations causing long -term conflicts, such as environmental degradation and water shortage and include them in the main policies of the EU, in particular in development, because it is meaningless to try to react quickly to something that we have taken years to prepare.And finally, allow me to also make Mrs. Schroedter's observations, in the sense that we need a parliamentary dimension in this defense development.We cannot limit ourselves to leaving it in the hands of governments.When Mr. Solana spoke for the last time in this Parliament, I adopted an extremely critical position at the fact that he barely mentioned the idea of ​​conflict prevention and today he is talking about this prevention here, but not any proposal to make it a reality seriously.We talk a lot and with pride that in sixty days you can prepare a contingent of 60,000 soldiers for a whole year, but we currently have crisis in Europe and its borders and elsewhere that this union is not addressing, which is abject.What we need are 60,000 civil police to try to address these situations.Mr. Solana has not given us any information about the springs that will be used in relation to Russia and Chechnya.Mr. Solana has not told us anything about whether he is doing or the European Union any diplomatic intervention seriously - diplomatic interventions seriously - to stop butcher shop in Chechnya.We have wide gaps in our defense, in principle, of human rights.We made a collection of the ability to intervene in Kosovo and now we are creating absolute chaos in that province, not sending the right resources and staff to address the situation, which demonstrates our inability to approach conflict prevention.Thus, I would like Mr. Solana to explain to this assembly the position of the European Union in relation to Chehenia.What are we going to seriously end up with that atrocious situation?We have springs that we could use with Russia, if we proposed it, but we have set out not to do it.Mr. President, Mr. Alto Representative, Mr. Commissioner, I would like to ask you two questions, Mr. Solana.How can you, with any credibility, continue the deepening of collaboration in military and defense matters if member states are not willing to comply with common commitments?	es
However, it would be more appropriate if the Union focused on its financial expenses on the existing community policies.Of course, some take the opportunity to beat each other with demands for more financial means, which is particularly inappropriate at a time when state budgets are particularly inappropriate due to the convergence criteria for the WWU.Ms. McCarthy proposes to increase the middle equipment for urban and the announcement of this community initiative by means of a costly PR campaign with which the benefits of the federal Europe are to be praised.It shouldn't be necessary to point out that the effectiveness of an edition does not depend on the amount of the funds provided for a project.On the contrary, the recipients of too numerous and too high aid are ultimately accepted as given.The goal must not be to make citizens a recipient of support, but their personal responsibility must be strengthened.The report also speaks sustainably for measures in favor of ethnic or sociological minorities.We can only reject a minority policy that is necessarily detrimental to the social cohesion.On the one hand, it promotes the integration of immigrants, while their cultural assimilation in the recording country would be necessary to avoid the development of ethnic ghettos as potential powder barrels.On the other hand, it deals with the principle of positive discrimination, which, as the American precedent shows, proves to be equally harmful.For all of these reasons, the French delegation of the Uen faction could not agree to Ms. McCarthy's report.Report Decourrière (A5-0028/2000) Mr. President, the Interreg program is particularly important to us.Like numerous other colleagues, I am pleased that the European Parliament has managed to preserve this Interreg initiative.Since I even live in the Belgian part of the Sarre-Lor-Lux Süd region, I know that Europe is being created there, that we are experiencing Europe every day and that the European unification process is indeed carried by the citizen.These projects really have to be taken into account and must already include sustainable development.Why do I emphasize this point?For the simple reason, because the current projects all too often affect the environment.For example, if you accept new roads, you accept new immissions in the European Union, and this completely contradicts politics that we z.B. to combat the emission of greenhouse gases.I also demand that the commission pays attention to the project selection that the environmental policy pillar of EU policy is integrated into these projects so that, for example,B. the goal of CO2 reduction is taken into account as a special added value in the proposed projects.I think especially of certain infrastructures in the planning.As is well known, some Member States have not yet decided between rail and road to cross susceptible areas such as the Pyrenees and here, especially the Aspe Valley.I also think of my region, where my member state fluctuates between a railway line and a second motorway, the A 32.Therefore, I ask the Commission to make sure that there is a real agreement between the individual policies and especially within the selected Interreg projects.Mr President, I voted for the DECourrière report on the Community Initiative Interreg, in particular because of the answer that Commissioner Barnier granted some MPs who asked for more consideration of the border regions with a sea limit in the program.	de
I hope that all these problems can be addressed and treated in the field of discussion that is currently being held on the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union.On an external level, I believe that most of the points that we have included in the resolution provide us with a fairly approximate vision of reality and does not invite precisely, Mr. President, to optimism, since aspects such as the abolition of capital punishment, torture still practiced in many allegedly democratic countries or the situation of minorities in many parts of the planet demand from the European Union a clear, visible and effective response.In my opinion, this resolution contains a series of essential points, but I would stop in a very particular one, which is the need for greater coordination between the European Union and the United Nations.Mr. President, in a world like the current one, every day more dominated by the phenomenon of globalization, and not only in the economic field, we have to give concerted and coordinated responses so that they can be effective.To achieve this effectiveness in our action, it is necessary to carry out coordination in practice that does not exist today.Therefore, this Parliament defends the principle of the need to participate in the Human Rights Commission and other international forums where these matters are addressed and, Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, this Parliament would like to be able to participate as soon as possible in this type of meetings.Soon, in May, the European Commission plans to present communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratization in the foreign relations of the Union.I would like to take this opportunity to ask the commission to take into account this need for coordination to which I just referred to and seek new formulas that allow reinforcing the role played by the European Union in the field of human rights and, in particular, for this Parliament, especially from an optics of coherence, recognizing the good disposition of those third countries that accept to include the democratic clause.I understand that this should have a translation into all purposes -and I mean also also to the budget effect.Finally, I would not want to recognize the important contributions that civil society can make in this field, as well as the role, often undervalued, of the numerous non -governmental organizations that act on the ground.The union must strive to facilitate all the necessary support so that they can carry out their important work.Mr. President, gentlemen of the Commission, when this plenary must reason on the issue of human rights, a serious risk that, if they want, is accentuated by the climate in which we must discuss this important issue.The absence of the Council and almost all the deputies of Parliament makes us understand how great the space that separates the noble, important and useful statements, from the formal point of view, of the concrete application of the issue of human rights in the field of daily policy.I believe that this Parliament, starting with the contribution that the European Union will give to the gin meeting, must fill out this space and contribute not only in the plane of the enunciation of the principles, but also in that of truth and even loyalty.	es
All this was conditioned by the approval of a budget that imposed limitations in various sectors, and in particular by the need to allocate funds for the implementation of the special plan for the reconstruction of Kosovo.The Parliament already at first reading approved a total of 34 amendments and the Council, in its common position, has taken over 18 in full or partially.Of the 16 left some, such as the amendments nos.5 and 6 in particular, they are now superfluous after the interinstitutional agreement on the budget for 2000. The discussion and negotiation that we held with the Council and the Commission have won around three issues: the budget, the calendar and the Committeeology.Your rapporteur wants to particularly place the emphasis on the commitment and flexibility shown by everyone to bring the positions on budget closer so that from an initial endowment of 9 million euros of the B7-6201 line, which meant a total of 73 million euros throughout the period, we have reached an agreement that provides for 249 million euros for the next seven years, starting from the 30 million euros already foreseen in the budget.Budget agreement - which implicitly includes an agreement on the times - the differences have coagulated around issues of the Committeeology due to historical positions of Parliament and the Council which, in view of the future - and in order not to insist on the problems indicated by the honorable Wijkman - in my opinion should be revised with an interinstitutional agreement to make the parliamentary legislative procedure more agile and fluid.I conclude by recommending to the assembly the acceptance of the amendments nos.1, 7, 9, 10, 11 and 12 and the rejection of others since, if they were accepted, they would cancel the agreement achieved after the discussions held with the Commission and the Council and would oblige us to start the entire negotiation procedure again, paralyzing certain projects and actions to be carried out, and undoubtedly causing serious problems to the conservation policy and reconstitution of the tropical forests that we want to develop.Mr. President, I find that the speaker, honorable Fernndndez Martn, who preceded me is right on many points of his relationship.Before anything else, for all budget lines it is very important to talk about their respective financial allocation.Exactly as for the report we have just discussed, I am not satisfied with the limited duration, but, in consideration of the many projects at risk, this argument is excellent for aiming for an agreement with the Council as soon as possible short.As for the Wijkman report, I am in favor of the Split Comitology, proposed by the speaker, that is to deal with the strategic lines by resorting to a management procedure and the measures concerning the implementation of the projects in a consultative committee.A point that I consider particularly important is the emphasis placed in different amendments - for example to amendment no.2 and to amendment n.4 - On the active participation of the populations that depend on the forest and the local communities.In my opinion, it is a truly essential point, especially in the context of sustainable management of tropical forests and other forests in developing countries.	it
If this certificate and proof of insurance are not available, the ship is shut down and must not leave the port despite all the port fees.We have to agree on that in all ports of the European Union, from Marseille to Rotterdam to Wilhelmshaven, Cuxhaven and wherever ships land.Fourth, we need liability for the ship owner, not only a ridiculous $ 12 million, but at least $ 400 million, which the ship owner must prove by proof of insurance.Then we need the country's liability, the flag of which leads the ship.We need the security that the country, under the flag of which the ship runs, assumes liability in case of doubt.It will be a wonderful control!I can guarantee that the countries that award the flag also make sure that they do not have to be liable.Fifth, we need the guarantee that this will be required for all ships in the ports and in the water of the European Union, also in the accession countries.This means that these requirements that I have mentioned apply to all waters.After all, we need the most important thing: we need a good memory, because we will talk about legislation more often in the near future.We will talk about environmental standards more often.Then I don't want anyone to come and say: These requirements lead to us losing jobs in the port.The unions come, the industry is coming.We need good memory, colleagues.I look at many of them who have not yet represented the top of the environmental movement.Go home and say: We have not yet taken care of the standards.We need a good memory when it comes to what is required in the ports.We need a good memory when we say: We once agree on port fees and port requirements and do not play one against the other in the European Union.If we can do it, we may be better in a few years!President!Ms. Roth-Behrendt spoke to me from the heart.It provided us with a perfect compilation of the various measures.But how will the crisis consciousness that we have developed from this environmental disaster?Let me call me the introduction of the freeboard brand of an earlier generation, a label that should prevent insurance fraud with limited seaworthy ships.Where has the crisis consciousness of the generations left before us?I think we should introduce the certificate that Mrs. Roth-Behrendt spoke, as well as the labeling of tankers with green brands, as was stimulated by some ports in Europe.In addition, the classification companies have to check critically because we cannot accept their procedure.We need an independent and transparent process.In conclusion, I would like to mention that some Commission's agencies see it as inadmissible promotion of advertising if environmental funding is paid to shipowners in my country who want to improve environmental quality.At the Commission, the right hand does not know what the left is doing.It is not justifiable if measures that are in line with the Commission guidelines for environmental improvement may not be carried out because they are regarded as an inadmissible promotion of advertising.	de
"They alone are able to invent policies likely to modify structures that have been developed by men for men.Because it is indeed to the structural discrimination that women are most faced, whether in politics or on the job market.It is therefore up to European political parties to open up to women.Moreover, article 191 of the Treaty (ex 138 a) underlines, I quote, their ""important role as a factor of integration within the Union"".This article continues by affirming that ""they contribute to the formation of a European awareness and identity, as well as to the expression of the political will of the citizens of the Union"".If such a provision has no legal value, it is no less highly symbolic.It gives political parties an important role in the construction of a democratic Europe.This can pass, for example, through the implementation of positive actions, through the promotion of parity within our political parties.Some parties have, on the occasion of the 1999 European elections, presented joint lists.This is a good practice, which must be generalized.I do not know if there is a link of cause and effect, but the fact remains that the proportion of women deputies in the European Parliament increased from 25.7 % in 1994 to 29.9 % in 1999. In addition, he has been chaired by a woman since the 1999 elections. I will end by taking up the conclusions drawn from the April 1999 conference organized by the Commission, entitled ""women and men in power"".Equality between men and women is not a problem that only concerns women, it is an issue that affects our whole society!Progress has recently been made in the increase in the number of women present in the Union's decision -making bodies.In our own institution, 30 % of elected representatives are today women, including the president of the European Parliament herself.Finland has also just elected a woman as a presidency.On average, almost a quarter of the governments of the Member States and just over a fifth of their parliaments is made up of women.These rates are still far from satisfactory, in particular given that the figures vary strongly from one Member State to another: women in the Nordic countries are much more represented in positions of responsibility and in decision -making processes.This situation is more a reflection of respect for the quality and competence of the contribution of women to the company than the result of quotas set.My group is not favorable to the use of quotas in general because, in the long term, they may go against the aim sought, or even to undermine the cause which they aim to support.We nevertheless recognize that experiences vary from one Member State to another and that certain recourse to such measures are sometimes justified, as a temporary remedy, with a view to rebalancing the representation of women where they are clearly underrepresented.We could support the resolution on women in the decision-making process, adopted in order to commemorate the international day of women on March 8, for which the Liberal group filed ten amendments and relaxed the reference to quota in accordance with the approach advanced above."	fr
The Balkan and Adriatic regions are particularly important, but in my opinion, we must not forget cooperation with Russia.Our group wishes to again raise the question of controlling the use of funds and insists in particular on better coordination of the Tacis, ISPA and flagship programs.This coordination is lacking and the commission has still not presented specific projects in order to improve it.Here in Parliament, we are waiting for the European Commission to inform our commission in the best time.During the practical realization, the participation of companies, organizations and other local actors is of decisive importance.Cooperation projects, based on experience, require better planning, more precise follow -up and more fruitful achievement.Projects have often remained halfway and efficiency has drowned in administration and bureaucracy.It is also necessary to demand from the partners of commitment to projects and the accomplishment of their own part.Our group reintroduces a few amendments been rejected during the committee examination.I will also mention the URBAN report in the explanation of the reasons from which the rapporteur dealt with merit the minimum of 500 euros per inhabitant, which refer to the guidelines of the Commission.This will not work as a mechanical objective but it will be necessary to be able to apply it according to the circumstances which reign in the region concerned.It is such an important aspect that it must be reported from the presentation of reasons to the conclusions.Mr. President, Dear colleagues, Interreg is the initiative which has the most European dimension of all structural funds.Here, projects should not only be promoted at regional or national level, but also in the neighboring regions which concern two or more countries.Unfortunately, this applies only to part of the money, namely for the borders included within the EU.But it is precisely the regions located on the border of third countries that require an effective instrument promoting cross -border cooperation.The regulations claim that this is the case.However, this is not the case.We have been in a situation where the Commission has not changed the regulations for years, although Parliament has been demanding it for a long time.Concretely, this will mean tomorrow for these regions a new deterioration of the situation in terms of support for border areas.The Parliament has requested since 1996 the creation of a common fund for cooperation with third states, in order to remove these difficulties.Nothing happened!These problems will again be able to ease and this in the expense of the regions concerned.Consequently, Parliament once again demands an improvement on this subject and the development of cross -border cooperation.We are also waiting for a common fund to be created and that the regulations be changed again in collaboration with the other commissioners.We want a Europe of citizens, not a Europe of bureaucrats!Mr. President, a third of the European Union resources go to funds for various development objectives.	fr
In the case of Türkiye, the situation is different: the plant does not yet exist and then I have already said that Turkey has joined the Treaty on non -proliferation and the nuclear security agreement.If in the development phase of the nuclear power plant, there will be reasons of concern about security. We will discuss it with Turkey.If we should conclude that Turkey is planning a nuclear power plant incompatible with European security rules, we would behave as we did with Lithuania, Slovakia and Bulgaria.I believe it is a right of the parliamentarian to demonstrate his concerns or fears.I don't share these concerns.I believe that Turkey fully recognizes the rules and criteria of the nuclear security convention and the treaty on non -proliferation, but it is out of doubt that European public opinion has some concern and it seems to me more than just to discuss it in this parliament.Question n.29, of the honorable (H-0786/99): object: weapons with depleted uranium has carried out the Studies Commission on the effects that transfrontier pollution due to the use of weapons with impoverished uranium during the Kosovar conflict could have on the EU states?Otherwise, for what reason?In the name of the commission, Mrs. Commissioner Wallström has the right to thank her, Mr Bowe, for her question.The European Commission has studied the effects of the conflict on the environment from the first actions of NATO.Already last June the Commission financed the first study carried out by the Regional Environmental Center for Central and Eastern Europe and concluded that no large -scale ecological catastrophe has occurred.None of the tests collected later or subsequent analyzes denied that first evaluation.The Commission was also strictly associated with the development of the recent report published by the United Nations Environmental Program - Balkan Task Force.This is the most detailed and more exhaustive relationship so far developed on the consequences for the environment of the conflict in Kosovo and I recommend reading it to those who have not yet studied it.The use of weapons with depleted uranium is one of the various issues addressed and the relationship is also available on the net.The Balkan Task Force has been hindered by the lack or scarcity of information about the real use of these weapons during the conflict.The exploratory mission of the Balkan Task Force in Kosovo has not found any contamination signal.However, this does not exclude the possibility that some areas of Kosovo were contaminated by the depleted uranium.On the basis of the theoretical assessment coupled to the exploratory mission on site, the relationship comes to the conclusion that any risks, if there are, would be limited to the area surrounding the target.The stability pact for Sudoriental Europe provides for further initiatives;A special regional plan of environmental remediation is also being developed which will constitute the reference framework for emergency assistance in the event of damage caused by a conflict, if this intervention should become necessary.Mr. President, first of all I wish to thank Mrs. Commissioner for the very useful answer he gave me.	it
We have not heard that beyond the proclaimed and positive objective of eradication of children's poverty, the autonomy of people would be reinforced thanks to the establishment, in each member state, of minimum decent income that would be part of a true strategy to fight exclusion.We have not heard that the objective of full employment would include support for local and regional initiatives, to the hidden sector of the solidarity economy, to the effective and coordinated reduction of the duration of work and would be accompanied by strong demands in regard to the quality and durability of these works.We have not heard that the long -awaited growth would rely on the choice of lasting development.We do not find in the document of the Portuguese Presidency or in the strategic orientations 2000 of the Commission the slightest footprint of the legislative project in the social area, to reinforce the protection of workers against dismissals or to fight against social dumping.Of course, we can only sympathize with the concern of the Council and the Commission to finally provide the European Community, after the Single Market, after the euro, of a political project proposed to all its residents, but the new governance that you use, abusively in my view, does not have the participatory democratic ambition to which the emerging European civil society aspires.Mrs. President, Mr. Prime Minister and President of the Council, the situation in the Union and in the generality of the Member States is to raise legitimate concerns, despite the conjunctural economic recovery.The unemployment rate is maintained at fairly high levels, long -term unemployment is permanently aggravated and employment levels are extraordinarily low, elements that are also accompanied by and aggravated by the growing precariousness of employment and that denote, in fact, a social situation that particularly affects women and young people and that is dramatically marked by about 50 million excluded.On the eve of the Extraordinary Council dedicated to these problems, the fundamental issue that arises, for that reason, is to know whether or not there is political will to modify such a situation.Or if, on the contrary, we are only facing one more initiative without consequences, which will be added to successive planes, strategies and summits already dedicated in the past to that topic and of which no substantive modification was.In our opinion, it is not only necessary to modify this state of affairs, but also, it is possible to do so.Necessary, because employment, and quality and rights, constitutes a fundamental right of the human person.Possible, if their true causes are addressed, which, in our opinion, are inseparable from neoliberal drift that has been characterized by the fundamental orientations, in particular in the macroeconomic sphere, which has exponents in the priority granted to the stability pact and the criteria of nominal convergence and, consequently, in the secondarization of social cohesion, generally accompanied by the completelabor deregation, incentive to privatizations, mergers and companies, usually causing unemployment, but also by a deeply restrictive budget policy in community and national plans.	es
We want the European Union level to come to uniform regulations for shipping with all its technical, economic, social and ecological aspects.The dangerous practices of cheap flags must be prohibited in the ports and waters of the 15 Member States and the 13 countries willing to join.We also speak together with the UDB for the creation of coastal guards and the use of sea inspectors that are subject to the direct supervision of the affected shipping areas in order to control the strict compliance of European legal regulations.The assumed resolution points in this direction and has therefore found the unrestricted support of our parliamentary group.I am pleased that the resolution on the effects of the oil plague emitted by the Erika, whose elaboration our faction has made a large contribution, was actually unanimously accepted.Since, in contrast to our previous resolution, it takes a closer look at the extent of the catastrophe, which turns out to be larger every day than the first impressions suggest, it is more demanding, precise and urgent.The overall assessment of the damage caused by all areas of fishing, marine cultures and aquaculture is currently hardly possible.However, it is certain that they are considerable.The balance sheet is worsened every day by new dirt.The losses are not only in sales declines, but also in the form of financial loss.The impairment of the good reputation of marine products cannot currently be expressed in digits.In addition, there are damage caused by the upstream and downstream areas (fish wholesalers, suppliers, tourism, etc.), as well as the costs of the local authorities for the elimination of dirt and the repositioning in the tourism business.Fishing and tourism, the two closely related essential sources of income of most regions of our Atlantic coast, are both severely affected.Therefore, it is necessary, as in our resolution, to emphasize the cause principle, supplemented by the duty of the polluter to remedy damage.It is the duty of the cause to pay for the cleaning of the areas dirty by its fault and for the restoration of the ecological balance disturbed by his guilt.With regard to the compensation procedure, those affected are very worried, because the first payments made by the FIPOL are limited to 25 %.This is a scandal.Of course, each victim must be 100 % compensated.It would be absolutely unthinkable to want to impose part of the damage to the victims, which they arise exclusively by the negligence of the person who was neglected.Furthermore, the initiatives taken by some local regional authorities, such as the Department of Vendée, are welcomed in our resolution to capture the exact condition of the coast before the first oil carpet arrives.This procedure is exemplary because it enables accelerated compensation of the victims, whether private individuals or local authorities.And finally, our resolution makes it clear that in the area of ​​marine safety, the vicious circle of general irresponsibility must be put to an end, this contradictory system of mutual paralysis, in which the states and the Union are of mutual advantage of the responsibility.Everyone has to perform the tasks that he arrives.The Commission, whose American reflex did not come into play this time, must quickly work out a general framework for marine safety.	de
We know that these waste is there and how we have to deal with it, and there is no excuse for not acting.This guideline pursues three goals.First of all, we want to restrict the use of poisonous heavy metals in the production of new cars.On the other hand, we want to fix the responsibility of the manufacturers.We can no longer take care of products at the end of their life cycle, but have to rely on waste avoidance.As many of the various materials contained in the product, as many must be recovered as possible.Third, we want to achieve the recycling goals specified in this guideline.These are the three most important intentions of the directive.The material that is present in the cars does not constitute a wasteland of resources. Above all, the manufacturer's resources are dealt with in a lavish way if we do not take care of the life cycle of a car.Two questions were raised here of great importance - of course there are more, but I would like to mention the two most important ones.First of all: who should pay for that?The second question is: With this draft we weaken the competitiveness of the European automotive industry?The first question is about who should bear the costs.According to the guideline, these are primarily to be taken over by the manufacturer in accordance with the principles of manufacturer's responsibility and the principle of pollutor.However, it is clear that these costs are borne together by manufacturers and consumers.We calculated that the effort for recycling a car does not make up more than 1 % of the price for a new vehicle.Can we fool ourselves that this money disappears if the directive was not accepted?No, of course we will all have to bear the cost of destroying the environment, and that becomes much more expensive.In addition, these only fall after a long time.So the costs do not disappear, but we now make it clear where the responsibility is and how the financial effort should be distributed.Are we talking about a crisis -shaped automotive industry here?Is the discussion about an industry with low profit clashing, which we have to help by not imposing him even more?Can't the vehicle industry afford it at all?Doesn't our true intention actually be weakening the competitiveness of the European automotive industry?No, of course not!Do you think that consumers' reputation will fall silent after environmentally friendly cars and vehicles with less fuel consumption in the future?What do you think, what requirements our children and child children or the legislators of the future will put on the cars?Of course, that these must be environmentally friendly, can be recycled, use little fuel and do not pollute our environment!Only in this way can we give the vehicle industry a future.We have to create healthy incentives to recycle waste and reuse materials and that we can exist in competition with environmentally friendly vehicles with low fuel consumption.The fact that the European automotive industry is already well advanced compensates it to it that even more cars roll through Europe for which it has to take responsibility.These are not horrendous sums or an unsolvable task.	de
The water problem and the location of the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon are also still unsolved.Finally, I would like to cut the question of a future Palestinian state.This could be proclaimed this year, with or without the consent of Israel.The Barak government has to understand that one was ready to conclude a peace agreement with a state as a contractual partner.Even if the negotiations should not be completed in September of this year, there are no contractual obstacles for the proclamation of a Palestinian state after this point in time.For us, which we support this idea, it is of great importance in this context that this state, as Commissioner Patten formulated, is characterized by transparency and democracy.We all want to contribute to this.President!First of all, I would like to refer to the joint motion application presented at the end of this pronunciation, where my parliamentary group has participated, and of course we agree.In particular, however, I would like to express our joy that Israel and Syria are going back on one another after such a long period of stagnation in order to accommodate their disputes.The recent negotiations are an important step towards a permanent peace in the Middle East. In this respect, it is regrettable that the peace talks have been temporarily suspended.Both sides will actually have to make great efforts.Stable peace in the region is only possible on the basis of an agreement that guarantees the security of the borders of Israel and the territorial integrity of Syria.To do this, normal diplomatic relationships and a constant dialogue must also be recorded.Hopefully Israel will soon take negotiations with the Lebanon in addition to the bilateral meetings with Syria and, within the framework of economic and regional cooperation, a multilateral approach.Unfortunately, as one of the most important donors, the European Union is still unable to play a significant political role in peace process.This peace process in the Middle East is one of the priorities of the common foreign and security policy of the European Union.A special task is responsible for Mr. Solana, the general secretary of the council and high representative for the GASP.The Commission and the Member States must also be encouraged to support projects with the help of which mutual understanding and partnership can be produced between the different peoples of the region.The importance of the Barcelona process, which must have a positive impact on regional cooperation, is also highlighted here.Syria's participation in this process is our consent, provided that it recognizes human rights, does not provide help to the terrorists and supports peace process without restriction.Of course, numerous problems remain unresolved and many questions unanswered, even in relation to the Palestinians.As is well known, the peace process is lengthy and complicated, with the necessary trust, the indispensable political will and the necessary perseverance, we will be convinced of this, our common goal, namely a peaceful and prospering Middle East.President!The fact that the peace negotiations between Israel and Palestine as well as between Israel and Syria are underway despite certain delays and problems gives rise to joy.The moment of truth is close.Is Israel ready to fulfill the UN resolutions and to return the Arab areas conquered in 1967 in exchange for peace and security?	de
The previous experiences have sufficiently proven that linear regulations on personnel loss and incentives, voluntarily extinguishing from the work process, often had undesirable effects.I remember that workers who had retired at the Belgian telephone company had to be called back so that the company did not lose too much know-how and experience.The discussion point will undoubtedly be the reduction in personnel when the postal services liberalization.It should not be forgotten that offers for the voluntary departure above all take on the employees who work under pressure or can easily find a new job, in other words, they are often forces that the company in question itself.In my opinion, it would testify to a consideration of human resources if the Commission would take some of these worries to heart, so that the liberalization of such a sensitive sector as the post is largely socially acceptable.President!Postal services and post offices currently seem to be a very current topic in parliament, and rightly so if you have their importance.Just last week, the newly elected MP held his maiden speech on this topic by our partners from the European Free Alliance, the Plaid Cymru, the Welsh party, in the parliament of the United Kingdom in Westminster.There was also a debate in the Scottish parliament, which was particularly referred to the role of post offices, especially in rural areas, as part of the service offerings and the survival of rural communities.Liberalization does not represent the only potential threat to the services of post offices. As we have heard, post offices in Scotland have to do far more than the post.Governments and some local authorities traditionally use them as a position to pay pensions and other services and also as a place where rents, local taxes, etc. are paid.But to the extent that the modernization of public finances' systems more and more leads to electronic payment transactions through direct debits and transfer, the life offices of the postal offices in the country are threatened.If a post office in the country, which usually also includes the only shop on site, closes, then this can become a great danger to the survival of the community and social cohesion.Instead of admitting that post offices are infiltrated by liberalization or the modernization of systems, the governments and the Commission should promote and support a branched network of post offices and regard them as an assistant on which one can build up by a location and services to be achieved conveniently for the residents.President!The post is responsible for ensuring that the post is delivered everywhere in the city and in the country, a tariff for everyone every day.Post was a public matter for 150 years and, just like public transport and power supply, a core task of national governments.Such obvious and useful core tasks provide people a reason to choose.They show significantly less interest in a government that does not take care of such things.	de
We are in the process of losing market shares.I think we have to do something to make ourselves more competitive.I hope you will help us.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!Today we are dealing with a very important sector in which more than 10 million people in the European Union are directly employed and that contributes to the fact that more or less disadvantaged, remote areas and island regions get back on their feet.Tourism also creates additional jobs and thus causes an amusement of employment, especially when it comes to the most sensitive social groups, namely women and adolescents.In my opinion, however, this is blatantly contradicting the fact that there is no European tourist policy.Due to the lack of legal basis, no measures can be taken for this area.Because Article 308 (ex-article 235) repeatedly used, according to which a legal act requires unanimity, it was not even possible to adopt a program of eight million ECU for five years and fifteen Member States.The measures that have so far occasionally been taken were fragmentary and therefore inefficient, the regulations were subject to the dictation of parallel, for example, the consumer protection, environmental, traffic, tax policy, etc., which often not only promoted tourism, but rather disabled, since their implementation usually brought costs for the tourism industry without being checked orThere are incentives to adopt them.I regret that tourism today does not even represent a management, but only a department within the general directorate as part of the restructuring of the Commission's services.We have to support our tourism!In our opinion, essential pillars that could create a foundation are the inclusion of a material-secured chapter on tourism within the framework of the reform, which also represents the legal basis for the sector, the development of an EU-wide tourist policy that promotes the sector without impairing the functioning of the tourism market, the coordination of tourism policy with the other community policies, the sector directly orIndirectly influence, its investigation as well as medium and long-term measures to promote competitiveness of tourist products.Since we are talking about employment, I would like to point out a very serious problem: the competition from Tour Operators and their effects, especially on hotels that are small and medium -sized companies and therefore do not have the necessary equipment and access to information in order to be able to check whether your contractual partner is now or not.Obviously, it is not enough to only work at the national level.Rather, measures to improve the relationships between hoteliers and tour operators, for example a corresponding charter, could be considered.It would also be conceivable to set up a special fund for bankruptcy cases in cooperation with the representatives of both industries.The Commission has already requested quantitative information about the damage that companies arise from such bankruptcies to get an idea.It also asked the European associations of the hotel and restaurant industry as well as travel agencies, Hotrec and Ectaa, to develop a regulation on the regulation of mutual relationships.However, no progress has been recorded since then.	de
"In the individual scientific subjects, however, only few women are represented despite the good results they achieve during their studies.This underrepresentation of women must no longer be accepted.I therefore take note of the European Commission's proposals with great satisfaction.The aim of the Commission document is to focus on the measures to be taken at the community level and especially within the framework of the V. Framework program for research and technological development.Of course I agree with that.Over the next few years, it is about achieving the participation of women up to a percentage of 40 % with the Marie-Curie scholarships and in the advisory and evaluation bodies for the entire V. FTE framework program.To do this, it is necessary to improve the debate and the exchange of experiences between the individual member states and to set up a registration group ""Women and Science"" as part of the V. FTE framework program, the task of which is particularly important in the recording and spread of statistical information on the participation of women in the research activities of the V. FTE framework program.Furthermore, as well as the rapporteur, I think that investigations have to be carried out on the reasons for the discrepancy between the number of women with degrees in scientific subjects and the number of women who actually work in these areas.On the basis of a better analysis of the obstacles to which women encounter, a strategy for their elimination can then be developed.We have to mobilize the numerous existing scientists' networks and achieve their support in developing a common research policy.The European Parliament will continue to pursue the implementation of the V. FTE framework program with regard to the promotion of women and develop ideas for the organization of the next program.In the field of science and research as well as in all other political areas of the European Union, it is important to integrate the gender -specific dimension in order to make a conclusion for once and for all with the structural discrimination, which prevent women from being able to participate equally in the competition on the labor market..(Fri) In its communication ""Women and Science"", the Commission announces the good intention of mobilizing women to enrich European research.This is very good and we are happy about it.Because in fact, too few women are involved in the research work in the European Union.We know that we can only change this underrepresentation of women in the scientific field through a school advisory policy that systematically promotes the diversification of the professional wishes of the girls and, after they have then completed their conclusion, about positive measures at a professional level.Apart from that, some colleagues obviously have abdominal pain because the committee's report for the rights of the woman we assumed contains a point that gives rise to misunderstandings and which some interpret as a quota according to which a proportion of women of 40 % is required in European research.Of course, this is not the case, because such a quota would be unrealistic.In addition, the report does not contain any deadline within which such a quota could be reached.In order to calm the minds and dispel the concerns of the colleagues, I brought in an amendment to the resolution, in which we simply note that the commission undertakes in its communication to make considerable efforts to increase the participation of women to the community research programs, which is at least commendable."	de
Appeal to the precautionary principle The agenda bears the communication of the Commission on the appeal to the precautionary principle.I will begin by saying that I am pleased to present this communication on the appeal to the precautionary principle that I have drawn up together with the commissioners David Byrne and Erkki Liikanen.The precautionary principle is not a new concept.The community frequently occurs, for some time, in the context of different political spheres: the health of the environment, the human being, animals and plants.Moreover, it, as well as appear in various international texts such as the Rio declaration and the most recent protocol on bio-siciness, has been explicitly mentioned in the environmental provisions of the CE Treaty, starting with Maastricht.The substance of the precautionary principle is evident: it is a matter of adopting some measures in a specific political sphere in which science does not offer certainties, but there are reasons to fear that the potential risks are such as to make these measures imbellent.In recent years, however, the use of the precautionary principle has been increasingly in the limelight.Episodes such as the crisis of the ESB or dioxin have given rise to a heated public debate on the circumstances that justify and make the precautionary measures necessary.In light of this growing interest, the Commission considered it useful to present a communication to define its position regarding the precautionary principle.The main objective of this communication is twofold.First of all, clearly and logically illustrate the way in which the Commission applies (and intends to apply) the principle of precaution to its own management and, secondly, to define application guidelines based on weighted and logical principles.We also hope that communication contributes to spreading a greater understanding of the management of risks and to dissipate the fear that the principle of precaution can be used arbitraryly as a disalored form of commercial protectionism.The starting point of the Commission in applying the precautionary principle is the need to guarantee a high level of protection in the areas of the health of the environment, the human being, animals and plants.Of course, this goal cannot be used to justify arbitrary or irrational measures, but it is possible to act even if science does not offer certainties.Consequently, the precautionary principle does not involve the politicalization of science, as someone has affirmed, but leads us to choose between science and politics.The initial decision to apply the precautionary principle essentially depends on the desired level of protection and the level of risk that the decision -making centers are willing to accept for society.This decision is therefore, by its very nature, politics.However, the measures that can subsequently be taken must obviously respect the general principles applicable to the management of risks and the guidelines to apply the precautionary principle are therefore the essential element of the document.The measures adopted must be proportional to the level of protection chosen - and therefore there is no need to crush a peanut.There must be no discrimination in the application process, that is, the measures must not operate distinctions based on the geographical origin.	it
From these contradictions we do not come out with hypocrisy and beautiful words such as convergence, benchmarking, modernization, concertation.Either the European Union becomes a true federal state with a real redistributive budget, a true mobility of work, and therefore, only at this point, with common rules at work and welfare, or it will be better not to deceive and delude themselves on impossible paths of convergence, which sound well but which actually hurt especially to the weakest.And it will be good for this to be all aware.Mr. President, deviating myself from what has been stated by some colleagues during today's debate, I am inclined to approve the Andersson report, also because it will notice significant differences compared to the Commission's communication.It seems to me, in particular, that the relationship, for which I wish to congratulate the author, support the solidarity setting of the European social model.It defines the general objectives of social policy, assuming unequivocal positions that I welcome me to underline: against social dumping and in favor of the right to social security, for the aim of the social convergence and above all, very concretely, in favor of equal opportunities for women.There are also some deficiencies in the not sufficiently in -depth examination of the macroeconomic policy of the European Union which contrasts the renewal of the European model of social status in a solidarity key.In the whole, however, I consider the report positive.Mr. President, I take the floor to reiterate that it is necessary to modernize social protection, a valid tool, much more than a simple step forward towards the construction of Europe.Thus is underlined in the report - in my opinion, excellent - of Mr Andersson.Europe, the European Union, although very strong in the economic and political field, would be unstable, weak and limited if it is not possible to strengthen its social sphere, increasing the opportunities to find a job for anyone who requests it and actually operating in favor of socially disadvantaged subjects.Considering that each person has the right to social protection and to a minimum guaranteed social income, I believe that the condition of those who were not born in the European Union should not be forgotten.Let's not forget that, during 1999, 717,000 people came to compensate for our low birth rate.For this reason, in the social sphere, an immigration policy is needed that is social awareness, as President GutierRes recently declared in Spain.We must also take into account the situation of those who, in the face of economic changes, mergers, absorptions and new technologies, etc., see their use opportunities threatened or reduced.Therefore, a training policy is needed that enable and prepare for new uses to maintain the position already acquired or to have a second opportunity.Sometimes, in fact, in confirmation of the title of the film, the postman sounds twice.I believe, in all modesty, that it is up to European, national and regional governments, to ensure that the postman sounds in more than one occasion.It seems to me, Mrs. Commissioner, that the responsibility of promoting and coordinating these possibilities falls on the commission.Mr. President, in addition to congratulating Mr Andersson for his excellent work that justifies this general consent, I would also like to thank the honorable deputies for their contribution and move on to some observations on what has been said.	it
We must continue to keep inflation, move on with liberalizations, guarantee more and more competition, promote the dissemination of information technologies and all new technologies;Stimulate science, the border of science, have the pleasure of being on the border of science.The next Summit of Lisbon that will address these issues -Dipusion of technology, employment- is a decisive summit.They have needed four years to be able to celebrate such a summit.We finally have it within our reach: we cannot miss the occasion.The last commitment is with a better quality of life.We have started this chapter with the White Paper on Food Safety: Now we have to take great steps in the environment.The case of the Erika ship and the poisoning of the Danube determine an urgent intervention at European scale to protect the environment.The time has come to think and, therefore, to create a European Civil Protection emergency structure.In too many cases it feels like this after the disaster has occurred.I think it is appropriate to start thinking about these things before disasters occur.These are the challenges we have before us: before the commission and before all European institutions.Mrs. President, Lords, how will we measure the five years of our activity?How will we measure the results of those five years?I don't know, but certainly a unit of measure could be the challenge we face in common.We take a very simple parameter: participation in the voting of the next European elections.If it will be higher than the previous one, it will mean that we will have faced our challenge.Mrs. President, Lords, we have before us all these great political challenges, however, thanks to the recent recovery, we also have great opportunities.This, lordships, can be the decade of Europe.And I say: this must be the decade of Europe.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, Lordship, the European Popular Party Group (Democraticristians)/European Democrats welcomes this debate with satisfaction and is congratulated that the Commission has submitted a document for its preparation.We also host with satisfaction the conclusions listed in said document, as well as the general content of the declaration that the President of the Commission has just submitted, Mr. Prodi.The conclusions of the document indicate that the five years of the Mandate of the Prodi Commission will be a period of great transformations.Europe will advance along the path of integration and union will at the same time begin an extension phase that is proposed to achieve, finally, the reunification of our continent.It is a demanding and ambitious approach, which we could even qualify as prophetic.Mr. President of the Commission, we wish you hopefully make it come true.However, we also want to remember that the present is the basis on which the future is based and we can only build the future if we attend to the present.I say it seriously and also with concern.	es
"As a commissioner for the budget, among the corresponding responsibilities are the relations with the Court of Accounts.This Accounts Control Development Council will guarantee an effective and rigorous monitoring of the internal audit.I would like to emphasize that changing our control systems will not mean at all that they relax.The proposed change will make them more effective both in terms of supplies and in terms of measurable and contrastable results.I can also specifically assure the Assembly that we do not seek what is sometimes called a ""Big Bang approach.""The financial authorization control ex before for each spending department will only be renounced when and as long as the internal control system of an department is fully adequate.I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 does not appear to discuss the fundamental criticisms made by both reports of the Committee of Independent Experts to the operation of the current centralized financial control system.That committee was very clear about the need to abolish the centralized authorization system ex Ante.It was also very clear about the need to separate the internal audit from financial control.In addition, I do not believe that paragraph 10 completely reflects the opinion of the Court of Accounts about 1997. Naturally, the Court of Accounts may give its appreciated opinion on the changes proposed for the financial regulations but it is useful to remember the comments made to this assembly last month by Mr. Karlsson.""The internal control of the commission,"" he said, ""is not energetic enough to prevent incorrect functioning. For example, the financial auditor granted ex authorization in the majority of cases of poor management or irregularity recently discovered. At the same time, the internal audit function is carried out in a uncoordinated way by several bodies, especially by the same financial control, the general inspection and certain general inspection and certain units of general directions.The Ex Authorization System was undoubtedly designed to ensure caution but, over the years, has deployed the perverse effect of reducing the point to which managers feel responsible for their decisions.I don't think there is any real disagreement between us regarding this.From paragraph 10, I infer that the underlying concern of its lordships is that there must be a carefully managed transition.Surely that will be the tenor of change as their lordships can check when they read the document for the reform strategy.Our objective, the objective of the committee, the objective of the Court of Accounts is not to abolish financial control, but to disembark from centralized financial control and improve on the basis of it.Before leaving this issue, I would like to add that we agree with the rapporteur in which the existing internal audit function must be kept while waiting for the establishment of the new independent internal audit system that will take place in a matter of months.Quickly changing to the part of the resolution dedicated to the fight against fraud, corruption, mismanagement and nepotism: the new most important proposal of the Versa report on the complaint of officials when they perceive bad practices.As I said clearly during the debates of last September and on other occasions, we all believe that it is positive to define as best as possible the mechanisms for this purpose although, obviously, we hope that they will rarely become necessary."	es
"I remind you that our Parliament requires credits of 850 million ECU, which is not enormous in the community budget, and that the current proposals are 613 million ECU.In any case, it seems to me that at least for the end of the application of Life, there would be a means that the Union will make a significant budgetary gesture in favor of the environment.Let me finish on the question of the operating mode of our institutions.The speech that I hear today is: ""It is absolutely necessary that we can now conclude quickly. Clearly, you, parliament, lower your claims, in particular your budgetary claims! Because, if we do not arrive quickly, in the context of codecision, to fix the framework of the LIFE regulation, we will be late in its implementation for the year 2000, and it is true thatWait for our credits.If you want to be reasonable, we must accept our position because, in codecision, we do not have time. ""I believe that our parliament often protests against this method, which does not question anyone, specifically, within the council and I certainly would not want the Portuguese presidency to feel the accounting of this fact, since in reality it is a bit of a tradition.Environmental question, the budgetary question is central and that the Parliament cannot give in to blackmail which would require it to be the only reasonable in this case.President, Gentlemen deputies, it is true that we openly disapprove of some of the options taken by the Council and the Commission.And I will have the opportunity to dwell on it later.However, it must be recognized, to begin with, that these regulations are better than the LIFE I and LIFE II regulations.First, because the basic proposal made Life more rigorous, more transparent and more rational.Then, because the common position incorporates certain essential aspects defended by the European Parliament at first reading, in particular the fact of retaining the promotion of employment as a criterion for selecting projects and the reduction of the overall impact of products from their production to their recycling and elimination, as a ""environment"" objective."	fr
Are there any objections to the protocols?(Parliament approves the protocols.) Mrs. President!I always care for the opening of the session on Mondays in the afternoon at 5 a.m.Yesterday, like many European MPs, I was impossible to participate, since Air France's flight, with which we normally arrive here at a quarter after two, was canceled by the airline without any reason.So we could come very late.If Air France keeps this boycott policy to the European Parliament, the parliament would have to take measures to prevent this from happening again.Thank you very much, Mr. Medina Ortega.I regret this as well as you.Would you be so friendly and send me this in writing so that I can contact Air France and the French government with the concrete details?I think that is really no longer acceptable, and we have to protest with all the reprint.Ms. President, I did the same yesterday as my colleague Medina Ortega.In my opinion, the French authorities - who are honored to accommodate the seat of the European Parliament in Strasbourg - should be aware of their responsibility for the guarantee of reasonable connections to all capitals of the Union.In any case, Mr. Napolitano, I thank you.Ms. President, I am not concerned with having aircraft delays, but I would like to ask to apologize yesterday's lack of my colleague Caroline Lucas from the Greens' parliamentary group, the British MP.She couldn't be here because yesterday morning she was arrested on an anti -nome demonstration in Glasgow.Her identity was determined, and although it was clearly demonstrable that she was a member of the European MP, she was held all day long.In my opinion, this is completely intolerable.I would therefore like to ask you - I have already sent you a corresponding letter together with my colleague Haitala - to urge the British authorities to do so that such incidents do not repeat and that one apologizes to Ms. Lucas.Thank you, Mr. Lannoye.I received your letter and have already imagined British representation.Ms. President, I would like to ask for something with regard to the coordination today that I did yesterday in the oral pronunciation for the Equal report.I ask for a shift in voting on the community initiative equal because we just need a little time to negotiate an important point.I am optimistic and really look forward to the coordination with serenity and confidence;We will find a broadest possible consent for this statement on Equal.We only need a little time to work out details related to the asylum question, and I therefore ask you to make the vote instead this morning.Ms. President, I would like to say something else about what Mr. Lannoye spoke to: Ms. Lucas was arrested on the edge of Glasgow because she protested against the Trident base in Faslane.My sympathy belongs to this protest.With Ms. Lucas, who tries to hide behind her parliamentary immunity, I cannot explain myself in solidarity.I was also arrested because I protested in Faslane.I didn't hide behind any immunity.	de
We know what happened recently in the United Nations General Assembly.We had to freeze our resolution on the death penalty or we risk seeing an approved resolution comprising absolutely unacceptable arguments claiming that human rights are not valid and applicable on a universal scale.The New York scene is different from that of Geneva.Last year's debate on sovereignty and humanitarian aid, which was held in New York, dealt with such a sensitive theme that he influenced all the other subjects.He certainly influenced the debate relating to the moratorium on capital punishment.The Geneva debate focuses more, however, on human rights.It may therefore be that we are more likely to make progress there.Second, Cuba.I want to approach this point directly by what we Europeans are the subject of unjustified criticism;We are indeed accused of not taking human rights sufficiently seriously.We are very concerned about certain gestures of the Cuban government last year, which even more reduced the freedom of citizens, gestures such as changes in the penal code and the scope of capital punishment.We also worry about the recent increase in the number of political detentions.We monitor the human rights situation through reports provided by NGOs and the activities of our human rights working groups based in EU Embassies in Havana.We have regularly expressed our criticisms to the Cuban authorities, and parliament did the same.But I do not think that trying to isolate Cuba constitutes the adequate approach.We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a country that respects market principles, the inviolability of contracts and the rule of law.We want to encourage a transitional process towards democracy and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.My point of view is absolutely identical with regard to the third subject I would like to approach, namely China.It's very simple, I want us to have relationships with China.It would be too easy and it would go in the opposite direction to the desired goal than to want something else, and that would be an insult to more than a fifth of humanity.I also want to see China transformed by a peaceful change into a free pluralist society which does not throw into prison activists of democracy or religious followers.So what should we do?Of course, we have to maintain enthusiastic trade relations with China and hope to be able to welcome this country within the WTO under reasonable conditions.It is really poorly appropriate to talk about a world trade organization that does not understand China - or even Russia elsewhere.But I do not think today, and I never thought it, that our emerging economic relations with China - which manifest themselves, for example, by the 25 billion euros in China excess vis -à -vis the European Union - should be silent when it comes to the situation of human rights in China.For me, the question is not to know if we must approach the question of human rights in China - we have the duty and have a legitimate interest for this question - but rather what is the best way to do it.	fr
We are also working in this sense to develop a profound and positive relationship with the Commission.Ladies deputies, I don't have much to add on these topics.In recent weeks, numerous events have occurred to which I would like to refer: Kosovo, the Middle East, Chechnya;Many things that I would like to comment with you.I would prefer, Mrs. President B if she allows me -, stop here in order to have enough time available to answer the questions that will be asked.However, before doing so, I was allowed to report a telephone conversation about Chechnya that I had a few hours ago with the commissioner of the Council of Europe Gil-Robles who, returning this morning from Chechnya, where he visited Grozni, contacted me by telephone to communicate my first impressions that, as you can imagine, are not good.The situation in the refugee camps of Ingushetia is precarious and constantly worsening;In most cases there is no more hot food in the arc of the day: the Russian authorities do not distribute more food, so they are the non -governmental organizations that are providing there.At Grozni at this moment there are about 20,000 people who in desperate situations, who have to walk kilometers and kilometers on foot to be able to find a place to eat something.However, there is something positive that is moving and that I wish to report to Parliament.The commissioner of the Council of Europe communicated me that last night, speaking with the President and with the Minister of Foreign Authorities, the Russian authorities had accepted that representatives of the Council of Europe joined the humanitarian mission already present in Grozni, under the direction of the Russian authorities;Negotiations with the presidency in office for the organization for safety and cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to involve, if possible, also representatives of this organization would also be underway.These are the only positive things that are able to communicate currently;I hope that in the next few hours we can have more information from Mr. Gil-Robles and above all better news from the point of view of the authorities of the Russian Federation.Lady president, honorable deputies, I will stop here.I would just like to go back to saying what I said at the beginning.It is a great satisfaction to be able to participate in the works of this Parliament, to share with the honorable parliamentarians the work that is carried out jointly by all countries and by the Commission, with a clear objective, the objective that our European Union can participate, exercising as much as possible internationally in the operations for the maintenance of peace.Europe does not want to make war anywhere, but to collaborate so that there are peace and stability all over the world.I sincerely thank the high representative Solana.The honorable poettering on behalf of the group of the European People's Party and European Democrats now has the faculty of speech.Thanks, honorable poettering.Honorable Poettering, it is clear that the intervention of Commissioner Patten is appropriate in this debate.It will certainly be given the faculty of speech when she considers to intervene.	it
In this area, coordination is the keyword.The water problem is always more topical.Climate change, small temperature increases have direct influence on precipitation.Some regions dry up, many others become humid.It's time to act.In March, the second World Water Forum will take place in The Hague.This forum defends a global vision.This vision must lead to regional action plans for sustainable water management.For the European Parliament, the time to act has now come.We must opt ​​for a sustainable policy in the field of water and, at the same time, we must be realistic.But we cannot fix the bar too low either.The common position is not ambitious enough.This is why it is essential to use previous international conventions or to OSPAR objectives.We must tend to the gradual abolition of dangerous products in 2020. It is understood for the marine environment.It is obvious that this agreement must also be worth for other waters.OSPAR objectives are being developed.A list of 400 products that have obvious dangers for the environment has been established.Both technical and economic levels, it is possible to approach the zero level in terms of emissions from these substances and this is the choice that we must make.Naturally, the directive must also be restrictive.Downstream countries must be able to count that upstream countries respect the qualitative objectives.Quality has a price but pollution can prove to have a price much higher than the future.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner!I would like to express my deep admiration for the remarkable work carried out by Ms. Lienemann about this directive on water.Let me remember that the most serious environmental problems we find ourselves today - the transformation of climates, the devastation of virgin forests, the exhaustion of fishing resources - always touch on resources that we have in common and which are absolutely essential to us, but which, in a way, are also without master.Let us also recognize that one can say soft waters of the European continent that their property is in an area of ​​blur, between what belongs to all and what does not belong to anyone.This is the reason why establishing responsibilities in this area is of strategic importance.It is also essential that the different rivers are considered global, treated as a whole that they actually constitute, whatever the country to which belongs such or such part of their common route.Dear colleagues, as has already been said several times, the proposal for a directive actually represents a historic chance of simplifying and improving the plethora and the real mosaic of EU regulations and directives and thus reaching a high level of environmental protection in Europe.However, I have the impression that the policy of the framework directive on water is imbued with deregulation and renationalization.I also hope that the vote will not be a blow in the water and two points are quite essential for me in this regard.First Oscar.We know that the commission's proposal is not far enough;Unfortunately, the same goes for the environmental committee proposal.	fr
In the fifth and last place, the aggregate to which the public deficit will refer will be the gross domestic product at current market prices, estimated according to the definitions of the European accounts of 1995. In short, this commission proposal is, in my opinion, a correct and concrete adaptation of the criteria established in the European System of Accounts 95, which, therefore, approved in its entirety, as expressed by the Commission.Mr. President, it is positive that statistical data is not only reliable but also comparable.This is especially important for the integration and achievement of the internal market.Hence this report also has a political meaning, for which we sincerely congratulate the rapporteur.It also results in a couple of political observations.The stability pact is a fact in Europe.All countries that participate in the euro have been forced through this stability pact to achieve budget balance in the medium term or have a small surplus.That, of course, does not mean that when the situation is contrary, there can be no imbalance, but in the long term there is talk of balance or surplus.The stronger the position of the participating countries, the firmer the euro will be.Therefore, the overcoming of the three percent standard must take place on few occasions, nor in the event of shortly unfavorable circumstances, that says at least logic.We have always opined that these criteria must be fulfilled strictly.It is very important for the EMA to also succeed in the future.Strict compliance with the stability pact can contribute to the creation of a culture of stability in all Member States.Several Member States have adopted exclusive provisions to comply with the criteria.We believe that the budget policy of the Member States must be strictly monitored, so that the measures taken to meet the established criteria continue to apply.Your attenuation cannot be allowed.Moreover, we consider that a greater reduction in spending and the reduction of public debt should be part of the priorities.After all, the expense is still impacting on future generations..Mr. President, thank you, first, the speaker for the magnificent work done.It was an issue that demanded high doses of technicalism and I think Mr. Knörr has treated him with great precision and great professionalism.I would not dare to summarize the content of our proposal better than him;It would only make a small additional comment by saying that, in addition to the adaptation to SEC 95, there are two small technical modifications that Mr. Knörr knows very well referred to interest and the evaluation of debt in foreign currency.I only say it as a comment to complete the vision of the process.Second, I would thank Mr. Knörr for speed.He has done a really good job in a very short period of time.	es
First of all, it is essential to encourage private investment.The union must help stimulate business spirit and create jobs in this way, but we must not forget public investment.This has been the great victim of recent years and an improvement in public finances must clearly allow us to improve public investment, however respecting our commitments in terms of tax consolidation.Our big bet for the future must be research and development, but also human capital.These are two of the great challenges that we will have to take up in Lisbon.We believe that it is fundamental to progress in these challenges with quantified objectives, specific definitions allowing us ultimately to achieve what we all aspire: net improvements of productivity which make possible increased growth in our society, as well as an increase in employment which makes it possible to regain part of the land lost in recent years.It is the policy that the Commission has defended and that we will continue to defend in Lisbon.Common Fisheries Policy (PCP) The agenda calls in common the following reports: A5-0038/2000 of Ms. ATTWooll, on behalf of the Fisheries Commission, on the proposal for the settlement of the Council establishing a community framework for the collection and management of fishery data essential to the conduct of the common fishery policy (COM (1999) 0541 -C5-0302/1999 -1999/0218 (CNS));A5-0037/2000 of Ms. Attwooll, on behalf of the Fisheries Commission, on the proposal for the decision of the Council relating to a financial participation of the Community in the expenses made by the Member States for data collection, as well as the financing of studies and pilot projects in support of the common fisheries policy (COM (1999) 0551 - C5-0303/1999 - 1999/0224 (CNS)).The proposals for the settlement of the Council for the collection and management of fishery data and decision of the Council relating to a financial contribution in this area are both to be welcomed.Hence this common debate, since each of them can only be fully understood in the light of the other.I understand that their development lasted about five years.It is important that rapid progress is now made, in view of the revision of the common fishing policy in 2002. Let us first take the proposal for the settlement of the Council.This requires member states to collect a wider range of fishery data that it was not required under the previous regulations.Both biological and economic information is included.The proposal also requires member states to produce such data in aggregate form.An application regulations will specify exactly what new data must be collected and which of them must be aggregated with existing data.The application regulations will establish a minimum community program and an extended community program.It seems that these programs will not cover the whole spectrum of potential data but will be selective, for example depending on the stocks of fish.The Council's decision -making proposal allows the establishment of a financial contribution granted by the community to the Member States engaged in the collection and management of data.	fr
"We will receive all the designs of the implementation measures that are forwarded to a committee at the same time as this committee.We will have the opportunity to examine the designs, to discuss it and to ask questions.However, we will only be able to officially intervene at the Commission if we believe that this has exceeded the implementation powers transferred to it.In other words, we can take action against a implementation measure in which the commission's powers are exceeded, but we have no influence with regard to the content of this measure.In a democracy, however, Parliament should also have the opportunity to question the content.We don't intend to do that all the time.We do not want to interfere with the implementation decisions, but it is a democratic security measure that we have this option in the few cases in which this seems absolutely necessary.This option is missing in the new system or is at least only partially available.Our fourth point of criticism is that a implementation measure that has been blocked in the comitology process is not referred to both legislative organs, but only to the council, which has the right to develop an alternative measure.This is not correct.Both organs - the Council and Parliament - adopt the legal provisions through which the Commission transfers implementation powers.If implementation measures are referred to, this should not only be done to an organ, but both.Overall, some improvements have been achieved by this system.The additional aspects that result from the interinstitutional agreement with the Commission are welcome, but they do not change the fundamental decision of the Council.Even here we voluntarily - this did not happen automatically - to do without the Plumb/Delors agreement as part of the entire compromise.We were ready to forego these provisions.We will have to pursue very precisely what was previously covered by this agreement, but is not fully covered by the new decision.We have to be very vigilant.So it is a step forward.My faction accepts this only reluctantly as a step forward.We are not as compromising as Ms. Frassoni.We see the limits and are certain that this topic will be on the agenda again in a few years.If we want a democratic union with the greatest possible transparency, we will have to deal with this topic again.President!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Ms. Frassoni, for the work done.Editing questions of comitology is never easy.Ms. Schleicher has dealt with a kind of ""committee magic"" that we always spoke of.Certainly the process has always been very complicated due to previous decisions that ultimately have to be rationalized.In my opinion, the agreement that we have reached between the Commission and Parliament represents a clear rationalization of the process. In our view, it is sufficient for the fundamental interests of parliament.Mr. Corbett has raised his concerns.He says that they have partially done and sometimes not.I would like to say that those who could clear the Commission have been cleared out.What Mr. Corbett addresses are other prerequisites that are not covered by the decision of the Council, but unfortunately we cannot go beyond."	de
"That has been the initial statement of the President of the Commission, Mr. Prodi, by presenting the strategic objectives of the European Commission for the next five years.We await with interest the White Paper on the Government of the European Union, which will deal with the issue of balance between the governments of the Member States and the institutions of the European Union and that will appear this summer.Regarding this specific point, I think it is important that we address the reform of internal decision -making procedures in the Commission.Together with the proposals that the Commission has transmitted to the next Intergovernmental Conference, it has indicated its preference that smaller member states lose their automatic right to appoint a member of the European Commission.That in the hypothesis that the European Union had more than 25 Member States.I do not want a two -level European Union to be built.I think that would go against the spirit and objective of the Treaty of Rome and all the subsequent treaties.In the commission there must be equality in terms of national representation, as in the other European institutions.I would like to remember those who try to eliminate the right of the smallest Member States to appoint a European commissioner, that the United States of America gives the smallest states the same recognition in the Senate as to the largest states.Practically each of the 50 states has the right to occupy two seats in the United States Senate, regardless of its population.Any future reform of the Treaties of the European Union goes through the celebration of a referendum in my country.It is very difficult for those who defend the ""yes"" to a future treaty of these characteristics achieve the support of the Irish population, if we lose our right to appoint a member of the European Commission.There is no doubt that in this White Paper on the Government of the European Union that will appear this summer, the reform of the European Council will also be included.Once again, there are special areas on the political level that should remain from the national competition of the Member States.I do not believe that in Europe there is broad support for the introduction of the vote by qualified majority in issues such as taxation, justice, internal issues, as well as foreign issues at the European Union level.Currently, under article 99 of the Treaty of Rome, decisions at the EU levels related to modifications of the tax system must be adopted unanimously.I think this proposal should be maintained, since a common European tax code would hinder more than would benefit the operation of the European Union.I am in favor of the expansion of the European Union.I am in favor of institutional changes that guarantee that the extension of the union occurs in an agilized and structured way.However, we must remember that the public opinion of the 370 million people in the European Union is a decisive factor to modify EU treaties.The changes should not be made in a precipitous way and cannot be too radical, otherwise, public opinion will really make the ratification of any future treaty of the European Union really very difficult."	es
It is therefore absurd and often impossible to transmit Life projects directly to another instrument.If we were to seek for each project other financing proposals, this would also require greater resources than those available in the current situation.Now that the Commission must assess with precision what resources are necessary for each action, it is an example of non -central action, but requiring considerable resources that we must avoid.The Commission cannot accept amendment 14 either, which disagrees with the right of initiative of the Commission.Regarding the discussion on the deadline, I would like to say that we must now advance the deadline for the entry into force of Life, fixed for March 31, 2000 in the common position.It will be fixed as soon as these regulations are adopted.To conclude, I would like to repeat that I am convinced that Life will become an effective instrument in the context of development support and the implementation of a common environmental policy.Parliament has contributed to a large extent to the improvement of this instrument.I am convinced that you share my desire to see the regulations adopted as soon as possible, in particular if one thinks of the major hopes of the Member States and other countries, especially among the candidate countries which now have the possibility of participating in Life.Thank you, Madame Wallström.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:30 am.Modernization of social protection The agenda calls for the report (A5-0033/2000) of Mr. Andersson, on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs, on the communication of the Commission relating to a concerted strategy to modernize social protection (COM (1999) 347 - C5 - 0253/1999 - 1999/2182 (COS)).primordial.It is a natural consequence of cooperation within the EU.It is based on monetary cooperation, which has since been followed by macroeconomic cooperation and cooperation at the employment policy.The logical rest is now to develop the social protection system.These areas are interdependent.Economic stability is a basis for progress and lead to a high employment rate.It also offers the possibility of developing well-being.The opposite is also valid: a well -developed policy in terms of social protection can contribute to an increase in employment and growth.Social protection is, in other words, a productive factor.There are differences within the EU at the level of the social protection system.Many of them stem from history.However, we now have a number of common challenges to be met.This is particularly the case for demographic evolution which does not only concern the fact that the number of elderly people increases, but also that the number of births decreases.The job market also changes.Women find themselves largely on the job market.Technical evolution is another challenge.We have to go to the front of these challenges together.	fr
For all of these reasons, I voted for the report and now expect the Commission to respond to our expectations and demands.(The session is interrupted at 1:05 p.m. and re -accepted at 3 p.m.The word has the word on behalf of the Commission Ms. de Palacio to open the pronunciation.Mr. President, I speak on behalf of the PPE, but also as a Breton MP, who is directly affected and shocked by these events.Together with Françoise Grossetête and the PPE, we brought in a draft decision.Fortunately, we now have a compromise proposal.The ancient of the tanker Erika is indeed a European affair, on the one hand because this affects some of the most beautiful beaches in Europe, which is affected and polluted, which is serious consequences for tourism, the professional groups dependent on the sea, and on the other hand because it is in question.One can almost certainly say that such a disaster on the American coasts would not have been possible.Why?Because the Americans understood the teachings from the disaster of the Exxon Valdez, and because they passed the Oil Pollution Act in 1990, which on the one hand contains stricter liability provisions, because it can also be liable to liability, and on the other hand, and also thanks to different provisions and in particular the existence of the American coast guard.If we had such provisions, let me tell me again, the catastrophe would undoubtedly have been avoidable.Therefore, we believe that the relevant provisions have to be revised, especially the 1992 minutes, which the agenda, in specific cases, freed the owners of oil tankers from any responsibility.If the tutor is exempt from liability, he is of course less interested in the controls that are responsible for the oil companies.The provisions must therefore be revised, and I thank you, Ms. Commissioner, that you have pointed out all inadequaces currently available in the European provisions.Above all, as you said, we have to reinforce the controls against both the flag state and the ship classification societies.According to her, the Rina is a Italian ship classification register recognized by the Commission.How does this recognition take place?Which reliability criteria are there?You will send a mission.We expect the results with great interest.You also have to reinforce the controls of the seafaring authorities, the controls in the European ports.As is well known, there is a Memorandum of Paris that provides for a minimum of control that a quarter of the European ports that start the European ports must be controlled by the seafaring authorities of the relevant country.However, this obligation is not met, not in France and not in numerous other European countries.Why?What consequences did the Commission draw from it or intends to draw it from it?It also seems necessary to me to reinforce control that is the responsibility of the questioner in this case of the oil company.When it comes to your financial responsibility, control will undoubtedly be a little more thorough.	de
"The Commission will fulfill the commitment to Tampere to present proposals for the approval of definitions, incriminations and common penalties in the field of human beings, the economic exploitation of emigrants, the sexual exploitation of women and children, in particular by placing the emphasis on the fight against the use of new media and, especially, of the Internet for the spread of child pornography material.We also prepared a communication and the debate on the tools designed to guarantee greater security in information society and knowledge and to combat IT crime.The 2000 also marks the beginning of the application of the European strategy of fighting the drug 2000-2004.In this context, the Commission, in collaboration with the Portuguese Presidency and the European Parliament, will give all its support for the interinstitutional conference on the drug problem that will take place in February.As regards Schengen - and more specifically the integration of the Schengen acquis of the Community framework - without now entering the sphere of competence of the Council, I would like to underline, in relation to the issue of topical of the restoration of the border control, which the Commission still reiterates the willingness to deepen the methods that allow you to ensure better control of the application of Article 2, paragraph 2, of the Schengen Convention, in the sense of making it more.imperative.The recent restoration of some checks at the internal borders leads me to conclude that it is necessary to proceed with a detailed analysis of the conditions of adoption of a legislative tool based on article 62 of the treaty.As was pointed out to Tampere, in view of the preparation of the European Council of Feira of June 2000, we will have to summarize the implications towards the outside of the new dimension of internal affairs and justice in the perspective of the adoption of interpilasty political strategies that strengthen the coordination of internal and foreign policy in this context and which contribute to the affirmation of the Union in the world.I would like to underline, therefore, that all these actions must obviously take into account the principles agreed within the European Council of Helsinki in relation to the candidate countries, so that the latter can cooperate and participate, as soon as possible, in this project of creating a space of freedom, security and justice.It is important to remember, among other things, that in 2000 the GAI negotiations will begin with the first group of candidates and therefore I hope that we can proceed with the preparation of the negotiating dossiers on the second group admitted to joining Helsinki.Finally, I would like to reiterate that the Commission intends to assume pole position in the presentation of the proposals to encourage the implementation of the Amsterdam Treaty.I hope that the Commission and the Council come to an agreement on the division of responsibilities in the exercise of the right of initiative and in the conduct of the same legislative process.As I have already said, the task we face is enormous and ambitious, therefore the Commission needs to be equipped with the necessary human resources to respond to this challenge and hopes to be able to count on the support of Parliament and - why not say it?-, of the Council to guarantee these resources and objectives, so that the creation of a space of freedom, security and justice in the Union becomes reality within the least possible time and thus can all contribute, with a spirit of interinstitutional cooperation, to the realization of this project, which undoubtedly represents the ""pearl"" of the Treaty of Amsterdam."	it
Mrs. President, the reform process has certainly been valued very positively, which must be recognized, although perhaps a bit benevolently.My question: the reform will be necessary, among other reasons, for the adhesion of new states and, with it, for the extension of the Union.How can we commission, parliament and national parliaments of the states that adhere effectively face this challenge according to the ideas and approaches of the states that request admission?The delegations are actively working in my delegation for the Czech Republic, but it must be revealed that we often maintain with each other a very sabihonda attitude.What can the reform contribute so that we configure more efficiently relations and collaboration, the common action of the European Parliament, national parliaments and the commission?I thank your honor to stress that, apart from its own inherent merits, the reform will be necessary for adhesion, extensions, and, in particular, the class of extensions that our union will undertake shortly.It is essential that we achieve this reform for the good of the current union and, of course, to facilitate adhesions.For the next few years I will continue with the method that I have begun to apply, together with several of my colleagues in the commission, of very deep debates with the administrations of the next new Member States.We do it to try to explain in the most complete way the system in which they will enter.I would also like the enrichment of the training work undertaken by the current Member States and by the Union in general to ensure that, as new officials arrive at the Commission and the officials and administrators of the Member States have to address the realities, the complex realities of the adhesion to the union and to the single market, it is difficult to see the seams.That is the level of improvement and benefits it would like.The only thing I can do now is to promise that I will strive to get it.Let me start wishing the commissioner a happy day of San David.Thanks for your exhibition.It is important that the commission never loses sight that, if the reform process does not connect with the European public, it will be an absolute and useless waste of time.That should really be the center of attention all the time.You have to provide them with a service and, of course, the recommendations on the reduction of payments in payments will be very well received -I am sure -but the other important complaint we receive from the citizens we represent refers to paperwork.Excessive paperwork.Is there any reference to the reduction of paperwork and bureaucracy for European financing applicants without ceasing to guarantee financial control?That is the clear complaint we receive and we must attend it.The other question that I would like to ask refers to the Audit Committee.Of course, it is worthy of approval, but it is essential that a reference to the supervision of the recommendations from the European Parliament in our management approval procedure is included.	es
In the world, in May, the European Commission planned to present a communication on the development of the role of human rights and democratization in the external relations of the Union.I would like to take advantage of the opportunity to ask the Commission to take into account this need for coordination and to seek new formulas that allow to strengthen the role played by the European Union and above all by Parliament on human rights, especially from the point of view of consistency, recognizing the good disposition of third countries that agree to include the democratic clause.This commitment should translate to all intents and purposes, and I refer in particular to the budget.Finally, I would like to underline the important contributions that in this context can make civil society and also the role, often underestimated, of the numerous non -governmental organizations that work on the field.The union must commit to providing them with all the necessary support so that they can complete their important mission.Mr. President, gentlemen of the Commission, when this classroom is called to think about the issue of human rights, runs a serious risk that, if you want, is also underlined by the climate in which we are called to discuss this important issue.The absence of the Council and almost all colleagues of Parliament makes us understand Coma is still very large the space that separates the noble, high and useful declarations on a formal level, from the concrete application, on the ground of daily policy, of the theme of human rights.I believe that this parliament, starting from the contribution that the European Union will make to the Geneva meeting, is called to fill this space and to make a contribution, not only on the level of the enunciation of the principles but also on that of truth and even loyalty.Human rights must escape a reading that is only linked at the time of the complaint or at the time of punishment.We are called, as Parliament, to deal with the issue of human rights especially in terms of prevention.In this sense, we must be in a position to export a culture of legality, a culture of law, a convenience of law.I believe that a long season has definitively ended in which the treaties and signatures were added to the treaties.Today we have many, perhaps too many, treated that intervene on the theme of human rights: if these treaties remain mere statement, they are only unnecessary places of thought.Today we must move on to a subsequent and necessary phase, which is that of the daily and mandatory application of what is written in our treaties, even if we must not forget that some fundamental treaties must still be implemented: I refer to the conference of Rome and to the fact that 14 out of 15 countries of the Union have not yet ratified the treaty on the international criminal court.I believe that we must verify and modify some political tools on the basis of which we measure the quality of human rights on the planet.We have often used tools that, on a formal level, can be comfortable but which, on the level of the political outcome, are absolutely useless: I refer to use, and often to abuse, which has been made of the embargo over the years and to the too prudent application of the suspension clause of the agreements between the European Union and third countries, in the event that human rights are violated in these countries.	it
I can tell you that, in the context of the negotiations currently underway on the third community framework of support, I asked that the provisions related to the principle of partnership are fully respected, including regional and local authorities and also for everything concerning non -governmental organizations and associations.This principle must therefore translate, in the context of the third QCS, in particular in the participation of all these partners in the committee below.This, honorable deputy, is the answer I can give.I thank the commissioner;At all at all his intentions and his interventions, which moved in the right direction.However, things are very differently.On the Community support framework, a centralizing hand hovers, so much so that at this time there is, on the question of funding of the European Union, to a form of state, government and party delirium.I can't show you certain television programs here, but I can read the Greek newspapers a few weeks after the elections.It was in Sunday's newspapers of all of Greece: the Ministry of Public Works and the structural funds: the work of the minister;Ministry of Agriculture: the work done by the Minister of Agriculture - a few weeks after the elections -;Ministry of Telecommunications: the work done by the Minister of Telecommunications;Ministry of Public Education: the work carried out by the Ministry of Public Education with a photograph of the Minister;Ministry of employment: the work of the Ministry of Remarkation, with photography of the Minister, photography of the deputy minister and, behind all this, the symbol of the community support framework.In the elections only a few weeks are missing.Parties and candidates make propaganda with the funds of the European Union, of the Community support framework.I ask the commissioner: what do we want to do?Will the commission remain silent?Do you intend to discuss it?Will the question of the Hellenic government or will we still run into the pathological situations of the previous commission?Mr Alavanos, I saw that he threw all the documents he mentioned to her left.I wish it would give me to be able to read them - once translated - to see how much he corresponds to information, to communication which I can only rejoice as a commissioner responsible for regional policy, and as far as propaganda.And then, if it is really necessary, I will formulate some observations or recommendations to the address of the Hellenic government.So I would be very happy, honorable deputy, if the documents delivered me, otherwise I will go after looking for them on the ground among the benches of his group.Having said that, I thought his question concerned the partnership more.Beyond the issues connected to the pre -electoral period you reported, I repeat that I keep local and regional authorities participate together with non -governmental organizations.But I cannot even write something different from the text of the general regulation on structural funds, which provides that the Commission collaborates with the governments of the Member States and that I have the Greek government as a partner, as the first partner.After that I will have to honest that the partnership is widespread, decentralized, which I will sincere with.I can not help but collaborate with the Hellenic government.	it
"I will only mention here wine and other goods produced in Golan and in the occupied territories.Peace reigns in Palestine and Israel.The credibility and respect for the legality of the treaties and agreements are essential if the European Union and the Parliament intend to play an active political role.Israel is sure that Europe is favorable to the security and stability of its state, but cannot ask us to be the accomplices of such serious violations.Palestinians know that the European Union supports the assertion of their state and their rights, but they must have confirmation.Peace is not built on the violation of rights.Some Israelis, such as the soldier Igal Moshe who refused four days ago to leave for Lebanon and who is today in prison, and some Palestinians, like those who have been refugees for fifty years and who, despite the demolition of their house and their lives, wish peace, are of the same opinion.It is above all respect for ourselves and the democratic rules that we have given ourselves asking us.Let me say, more prosaically, that it also concerns the loss of income of European citizens arising from this violation of human and economic rights.Mr. President, Messrs deputies, Madam MP Morgantini, the questions that the Commission has formulated relate to any illegal exports to the European community of products from the Israeli colonies or occupied territories benefiting from a preferential treatment and therefore, they call into question the correct application of the rules of preferential origin.The Commission has also already given a written answer to a question from the deputy on this subject in January 2000. But Madam MP wishes to obtain additional information.So I'm going to strive to provide them.First, when you refer to the lack of clarity of the agreement, I can tell you that the provisional agreement on trade and related matters between the European Community and Israel specifies that it applies to the territory of the member states of the European Community and, I quote, ""to the territory of Israel"".And that, consequently, in the perspective of the European Union, it is quite clear, in view of the details set out in the written response of Commissioner Christopher Patten, which I will read you in the original language: ""... as communication already explains, the community cannot consider Israeli settlements or occupied territories as part of Israeli territory for the implementation ofThis \ Israel. This is a very sensitive question because it relates to the broader question of borders, the Israelis and the Palestinians ""we have many times expressed this position to the authorities of Israel during all the official meetings between the Commission and the Israeli Minister, the most recent dating of January 21, on the occasion of which Prime Minister Shimon Peres s'Commissioner Christopher Patten.And as Madame the MP has just reported, it is noted that the interpretation of Israel as to the field of territorial application of the agreement does not coincide with the interpretation of the European Union, but, with the optics of the Commission, our interpretation does not present ambiguity."	fr
In other words, experts are increasingly convinced that climate change and, in general, human activities have a link with the increase in natural disasters recorded in recent years.In fact, in the last decade the temperature has risen more than in the rest of the entire century.That's why Europe must clarify clearly against the Kyoto protocol and promote concrete proposals.Secondly, I was a rapporteur on the theme of Civil Protection in Europe, and I completely agree with the commissioner when he proposes to give life to a European civil protection body.Furthermore, since it is an extraordinary calamity situation, an extraordinary budget line must be used.First of all, we want to express our solidarity with families who have lost loved ones in this terrible tragedy and their communities.It is precisely the loss of human lives that makes this disaster so extraordinary for Europe.It is deplorable not to have an instrument that allows you to assist similar circumstances.I thank the commissioner for his comprehensive declaration on the topic and for having suggested to organize us at European level to provide assistance to the Member States and the regions affected by similar tragedies: this is important.Another aspect we must keep in mind: in the past we had a budget line, limited yes, which certainly was not enough to do a lot, but which on repeated occasions was exploited by deputies of this parliament to propose interventions even in cases of not serious disasters.The officials and ministers of the Member States went to Brussels, exchanged two words in private with the Commission, obtained a handful of euros and boasting the political result of being able to present themselves in their strong circumscriptions of the aid obtained.This is to say that the budget line in question was not very popular when it was abolished.I believe that this budget line should be restored.On the occasion of the earthquake in Greece, a great disaster, the community did not have a tool to manifest its solidarity and participation in the Greek population exactly as in the case of floods in France and this last catastrophe.These are great disasters, we should have some tools and instead we do not have it;We should then reintegrate it and adopt severe rules so that it can only be used in case of severe disaster.The funds saved could be reported from year to year so as to have an intervention tool in case an event of particular gravity occurs.This time Ireland has not been heavily hit, despite the numerous strong wind storms in the Atlantic.Even in Ireland we had floods and I wish to express my solidarity with the Irish populations that have been affected.Ladies colleagues, we shouldn't have short memory.It is true that I recommend and Parliament, jointly, have decided to suppress the budget line for the urgency help.It is also true that there is a lot of European money as commissioner Barnier indicated: for obstructure and agriculture it would be resorted to article 30 of the regulation on rural development and for the silviculture to article 33, for companies to the derogations provided for in the right of competition referred to in article 87, paragraph 2 of the Treaty, for public structures for structural funds.	it
I oppose amendments 7 to 13, which were resolutely rejected by the Fisheries Committee.Their content, mostly, is useless or is already mentioned in my text.In particular, I drew attention to the need to study the scope and the effects of the interaction between breeding salmon and wild salmon, the need to study the source of the AIS and the need to carry out wider tests on the presence of the virus within the stocks of wild fish.These amendments deposited by the green component of the Green Group/European Free Alliance aim to provide a justification for amendment 13. This amendment is completely unacceptable and inappropriate, since it seeks not only to maintain the obligation of compulsory and immediate slaughter of all fish but it also aims to prevent any fish from an infected exploitation, whether sick or not,In accordance with current policy, no sick fish is sold.No proposal is made to change this situation and, as part of the new proposed regime, there is no question of selling sick fish.Amendments 7 to 13 simply do not take into account the reality demonstrated by the highly contrasting statistics provided by Scotland and Norway.In Scotland, we have undergone a draconian regime that has not achieved its objectives.In Norway, thanks to their longest experience, systematic and compulsory slaughter was abandoned a few years ago and a series of measures led to the situation improves dramatically.It is our interest in everyone that in Scotland, we can also contain the AIS and prevent the continuation of its spread.Last week, in Scotland, a joint working group on AIS, made up of government and sector representatives, published a report.This exhaustive document takes into account a wide range of possible risks and recommends carrying out action in order to attack it in areas such as site transmission, safety measures in order to reduce leaks, waste treatment and effluents, detection and diagnostic methods, low and rotation, disinfection of equipment and many other measures.Certain measures may be immediately applied - and will be applied - by local authorities by using existing powers and others will be included in practice codes.They will all be beneficial, not only with regard to AIS but also to identify better quality standards in aquaculture in general, where it is necessary.Dear colleagues, your vote in favor of my report as a whole and as adopted by the Fisheries Commission will constitute a significant part of a wider train of measures concerning the control of the AIS, based on the reality of the situation in Scotland and the lessons learned from the successes obtained by other countries.I congratulate Mr. Hudghton, I fully support his report and urgently invite the honorable deputies of the Parliament to do the same.As it has mentioned, fish exploitation constitutes a crucial source of jobs in the most remote parts of rural Scotland and, at a time when the rural regions of Scotland have suffered from the worst recession for more than a century, the aquaculture industry is essentially raising the rural economy on which several thousand jobs depend on or indirectly.As he mentioned, more than 85,000 tonnes of salmon are produced by Scottish farms in a sector which generates more than 800 million euros each year.	fr
Will the European Union be able to take a united position for the first time and to develop a common policy in the face of such a complex problem?We also ask ourselves if the European Union has drawn the debt teachings from the negative experience conducted in Bosnia and the one just most positive acquired in Kosovo on aid.Will we be able to achieve better results in light than learned in Macedonia and in four other countries?In consideration of the particularly ambitious expectations, I do not believe it is excessive to argue that this first step, the stabilization and association agreement, is of crucial importance.This is not the only contribution of the European Union.A debate will be held shortly on the stability pact, on the dear program and short -term financing.The topic currently in question is that of the stabilization and association agreements, which represent a medium term perspective.For this reason I believe that this first agreement with Macedonia is so important, because it is a model.I am convinced that the other four countries are wondering what will happen.What about fate will reserve the European Union to Macedonia?And will it be the same fate that will also be reserved for the other four countries?For this reason I consider that this first step, this model, covers a crucial importance.Macedonia represents a model also for another reason.The speaker has already remembered it very clearly.These are whole relationships.In this regard, we must not build a too idealized version of the situation.It emerged during the presidential elections that remain difficult, but, compared to the rest of reason, Macedonia could still be considered a model.There are numerous advantages that can be achieved if we succeed, together with the Macedonians, to export this model in the rest of the western Balkans.The same model also applies to regional cooperation.I fully agree with the speaker when he states that a balance must be found between the promotion of regional cooperation, on the one hand, and the maintenance of the opening to Bulgaria and Greece, on the other, avoiding any closure.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, if we manage to take this first step correctly, many will be the advantages that will derive from it.If we waste this possibility, the damage will be even greater.Mr. President, I allow myself first of all to say that I have no difficulty approving this widely motivated relationship in principle.I would simply like to detect a point that I think is missing in the report and which constitutes a serious problem for Macedonia as well as for the effectiveness of financial support and other types by the Union.I refer to the penalties against Yugoslavia.In order not to give rise to misunderstandings, I also consider an energetic opposition to the Milosevic regime necessary.But, first of all, the sanctions affect many neighboring countries to be serious and negative, including Macedonia, which are already found in an extremely critical economic situation.Secondly, in violation of the humanitarian perspective and with counterproductive political effects, the entire Yugoslav population is held responsible for the misdeeds of Milosevic and its acolytes.	it
I think it was important that everyone has given particular importance to the role of the European Union in developmental policy on an international scale.All of them are determined, and that was the topic of today's pronunciation that the European Union inevitably has to reinforce the coherence of its individual to the development goals so that it can take on a more active and leading role internationally in development policy.I think in some requests to speak, it was also very clearly pointed out that this responsibility for the coherence of the political of the European Union is not only at the Council, the Commission and also not with the parliament.Rather, it must be the subject of concerted efforts, considerations and a legislative and institutional preparation, and this at both commission and on the council level and in the European Parliament itself. In addition, some MPs have made proposals for this, such as the establishment of an observation center or working group, which should monitor the measures of the individual policy fields in the special area of ​​development.In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that it is also important, because this was a focus in the program of the Portuguese presidency, to point out the explanation that it is necessary to grant developmental policy in connection with the other policies of the European Union and especially within the framework of their foreign policy.We consider this to be absolutely essential because we will not succeed in developing consistent measures in the area of ​​the coherence of the political, if we are unable to give developmental policy the importance that is due to it as an instrument for confirming the principles and values ​​that shape the image of Europe in the international system.For this, it may be necessary, as I said, to make a paradigm shift, to leave the post -colonial paradigm behind and to give development policy another European dimension.In this regard, I think (and in some requests to speak here too) that with the assumption of the new agreement that takes the place of the Lomé Agreement, an important instrument is available at a time when the concept of the partnership with suchTo renew south and to give it a new dynamic.I hear a certain frustration from many speeches for this debate.On behalf of the Commission, I presented you with an explanation that, in my view, contains useful background information for this discussion.We will provide more precise information about all the questions of coherence.This discussion is not new.We are currently working on it in the Commission, and when this work has ended, we will report on it because many have asked about the coherence report.I have no doubt that the political attention, which, as it has become clear in today's debate, is increasingly focused on these problems to give it to the Commission and the GD development to grant the highest priority on the agenda of the tasks of the coherence.	de
This element of regrowth of inflation can be especially significant if it ends up generating cost inflation, so we always talk about the need for a salary policy compatible with the inflation definitions we want to propose.The Parliament, in its analysis, has highlighted another issue: the evolution of the risk of stock markets.From the point of view of the commission it is significant, although we do not believe it is the substantial problem.In any case, I would like to highlight that we currently have excellent opportunities to do more things.I think we all agree that, after a decade of a very weak growth and intolerable unemployment, there are some things to do.There is a lack of public and private investment.Our research and development levels are too low compared to our competitors and we have a low employment rate that reflects, among other factors, mismatches in our labor market.Our goal must, therefore, to make this economic reactivation a lasting period, of strong growth and employment creation.Employment creation remains the fundamental objective of the Commission, as we have reflected in the Document Prodi, which has been sent for its debate at the Lisbon Summit, to the extent that we bet on a full medium -term employment.What policy should we start to achieve these goals?In our opinion, the union lives an economic reactivation situation, but there are still unused production capabilities.Not only the use of physical capital but also, above all, the new employment deposits.The Policy Mix that we started would have to allow precisely the full absorption of these capabilities.We have to define a macroeconomic policy that helps growth.It is true that it is not an expansionist policy in the sense of growing by growing;It is simply a budget policy that can be consistent with price stability, but also allows us an adequate monetary policy that facilitates growth.And that polycy-Mix will undoubtedly be good for investment and facilitate growth.The potential growth of the union, in our opinion, must pay special attention to some factors.I think that in most of them we agree with the analysis carried out by Parliament.First, it is essential to facilitate private investment.The union must contribute to fostering the spirit of business and generating employment in that way, but public investment should not be forgotten.Public investment has been the great pagan of these last years and an improvement of public finances must clearly allow us to improve public investment, which must be made, however, respecting our fiscal consolidation commitments.Our great bet of the future must be for research and development and for human capital.These are two of the great challenges we have for Lisbon.We believe it is essential to advance in these challenges with quantified objectives, with specific definitions that allow us in the end what we all intend: clear productivity improvements that make possible greater growth in our society, with an employment growth that reduces part of the distance we have lost in recent years.That is the policy that as a commission we have defended and that we will continue defending in Lisbon.Common fishing policy (PPC) In accordance with the agenda, the following reports are carried out:	es
Fourth and last aspect that I would like to submit for consideration of their lordships, necessarily about this aspect of development policies: the role of the Development Council.It has been examined, especially in recent months, the role that the Development Council can play within the framework of the Union policies.It is known that the difference in statute between those of development and other policies at the level of the Union is flagrant - it has been to see the difficult conditions in which the budgeting or not of the Fed has been raised - and it is difficult to admit that we can infuse greater coherence to the policies of the European Union without a more active role and more intervention of the Development Council in the advice regarding political decisions that eminently correspond to the sphere of development and that are adopted in other councilIn other decision centers, which go from the agriculture and fishing Councils to those of the Environment, but with respect to which the Development Council has not had any possibility of being heard or intervening so far.Therefore, without a more active role of the Development Council in the global coordination of political decisions that, even directly affecting the development policy of the European Union, are adopted outside its decision center, it will undoubtedly be difficult to apply a policy of greater coherence of the European Union in relation to the development objectives.Also in that regard the words and reflection of the European Parliament will be appropriate and as such will be welcomed..(En) To start I would like to say something about the negotiations between the EU and the ACP countries, which have ended successfully.I have to say that participation in these negotiations was an extremely positive experience.I could see the Member States working as a team, which is a really comforting experience.The two parts were deeply satisfied when the negotiations ended, not only because they had ended, but because we all knew that we had achieved something in common, the EU and the 71 ACP countries.That is something that the world needs and represents a very positive signal within the framework of debates on globalization.I would like to highlight some of the main innovations of the new agreement.We explicitly deal with corruption;We established a framework to deal with the immigration problem, for the first time.We promoted participation approaches, established the consultation of civil society about the reforms and policies that the EU will support.We focused on development policies on poverty reduction strategies.We base the allocation of funds not only on an evaluation of the needs of each country, but also of the results of its policy.We create an investment mechanism to support the development of the private sector.We rationalize instruments and introduced a new continuous regime programming system, thanks to which the community and the beneficiary country can regularly adjust their cooperation program.We decentralize administrative responsibilities and, in some cases, financial, and transfer them to the local level with a view to giving more efficiency to cooperation.We improve the regulatory framework of trade and investment development.We promoted cooperation in all spheres of importance for trade, including new issues such as labor standards and links between the environment and commerce.	es
"In this case, Mr. President, we certainly have a decalogue.A whole series of problems have been cited but, except your respect, it seems that the Commission, in a way, dares not say ""it would be necessary to act"" for any of them.It seems to me that you have not insisted - and even too much in my opinion - than on a point, namely on the fact that little by little the objective that you consider priority is to dismantle ""superfluous"" activities.However, we are attentive, Mr. President, because we have experienced a crisis of confidence vis -à -vis the Commission and we counted on this commission - at least the majority of this Parliament - precisely so that, above all, the reform of the Commission is accompanied by a reinforcement, a new identity, an impression of being again led by an alert hand.Let us take the fact that the Commission wants to dismantle or propose to dismantle, not judging itself up to the task, for example the powers, which the treaty, of the execution of common policies, confers.What do we ask in a certain sense from a government?What do we ask this structure, so to speak, ambiguous and particular that is the European Community?It is good that common resources have a supranational government and that they are not delegated to the Member States or to BATs, as has happened in the past.I find that you submit the same menu to us, but in a more serious way, by limiting you, as you say, to the homework of some white paper, as you have offered us.I fear - even if you signal that no, Mr. President - that this does not translate into what certain countries have been thinking for years, that is to say that the Commission must be a good secretariat of the Council of Ministers.If this is the role that the Commission intends to assume the next five years, we, convinced federalists, are certain that it is not the right way to follow.We will challenge you and judge what the Commission intends to do.The reform is important but, if it leads to a deterioration, a reduction and a decrease in the supranational powers of the Commission, it will go from the future of European integration, of the future that the founding fathers had envisaged for the European Commission.As for the other points, Mr. President, I will raise for example that of economic and social policy.Certainly, the European social model is experiencing a serious crisis;Admittedly, unemployment constitutes, and it is no coincidence, a problem that none of our policies has managed to solve.But it is not certain that we will be able to solve unemployment by drawing up the list of problems we have spoken in the past, without having a clear vision, without proposal, that which makes it in Europe economies which move at one of the most sustained pace and which are, but it is not a coincidence, those which have managed to make the flexibility of the labor market and the company their number one objective."	fr
I can only reiterate it in turn.It is absolutely important to involve the public with adequate information and with a consultation procedure.This is also reiterated also in considering 14. At the honorable Bowe I would like to say that he, exactly like my Scottish collaborator, will be able to continue to enjoy a few glass of Scottish whiskey every now and then with his conscience in place.In fact, the Commission did not consider it necessary to regulate the very limited water consumption required by the production of whiskey.I now want to make some comments a little more detailed on some topics in question.The limitation of the release of dangerous substances in the waters must constitute one of the most important objectives.I am pleased to find that the amendments presented by Parliament focus on this aspect.The Commission total supports the proposal to introduce the commitments provided for by the Ospar Convention in the text.However, it is necessary to comply with their exact content and their exact scope.As I have already said, the goal and calendar of the Ospar Convention above all represent a political commitment.The introduction of a legally binding calendar would not be in line with this commitment.However, it should be guaranteed that the Member States and the Community are obliged to take measures to achieve those objectives and to comply with the calendar.I therefore welcome the amendments nn.6, 10, 14, 24, 58, 60 and 88. The Commission cannot instead accommodate amendment no.19, in which dangerous substances are defined in different terms with respect to the OSPAR Convention.The Commission proposal introduces a clear procedure for the selection of substances, and this makes a definition superfluous.Although I myself share the content of the amendments nos.79 and 106, these amendments go beyond the commitments provided for by the OSPAR Convention.I therefore cannot welcome them.The Commission can also accommodate amendment no.60, according to which a calendar is needed for the proposal of the Commission relating to the limitation of priority substances.Amendment no.59 introduces the requirement of a constant revision of the list of priority substances.However, this would entail legal uncertainty around the status of the list and, therefore, the amendment cannot be accepted.The request, referred to in the amendments nos.60 and 93, of a guide list and a list of substances for which sufficient data cannot be available cannot be accepted.Lists of this type would have an uncertain legal status and would not collide with the procedures for the adoption of the priority list.In this regard, I would like to underline that the OSPAR Convention does not change in any way the community legislation existing on nitrates deriving from agricultural activities.The nitrate directive will therefore not be influenced by this framework directive.I appreciate the fact that Parliament has shown itself flexible on the very delicate and difficult question of the tariff of water services.I fully support the request that the price of the water is set at a level that constitutes an incentive to use water resources sustainablely.I also support the request for an adequate contribution from each sector to cover their costs.I can therefore accommodate the amendments in principle and in principle.43-46 and amendment no.	it
I direct your attention to one thing: it is dangerous to sketch the entire government activity of the European Union from here.I would be clearly advocate of subsidiarity.In my opinion, if we are able to determine which is the area of ​​our government work.Incidentally, I believe that subsidiarity also deserves a consideration.It must not only be the Commission, our states, our parliaments and our civil society must be, which also think about them.Finally, I would like to briefly respond to the last goal that we think is absolutely fundamental: stabilizing the continent and strengthening the role of Europe in the world.Here I would say that there is a agreement and support with regard to the priority of Southeast Europe, with regard to the expansion and-I have already pointed out this-the integration process and the strengthening of the European Middle Means program as well as our ability to make conflict and with regard to a topic that is very little spoken of, the north-south challenge.We must not forget Africa, not only from God, but also by Europe, and also our important contribution to development cooperation.At the end, a question in which we, as the world's most important economic and trade power, are increasingly responsible, is the voice of the European Union in the world.This not only means an active attitude in relation to the millennium round.This means the reform of the United Nations and the International Financial Institutions in which Europe bears huge responsibility.And above all, and with that, and with that, Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen, we have to be able to express this in an understandable and clear language by changing the jargon we use in a way, because we cannot ask for the Europeans to go through deep changes and share our enthusiasm if we continue to maintain a very difficult to understand and turn back to them.This is the most important means of increasing and strengthening trust, which, in any case, can be measured in the next European elections.Mr Commission President, First of all, on behalf of my faction, I would like to assure you that we share your starting point and support the core of the analysis and the strategy presented in this house today, namely that Europe faces major and clearly political challenges.Politically because we are in a process of further development.Even if it is still working on the economic building blocks, we leave the purely functional structure in Europe and turn to a political perspective characterized by larger challenges.The expansion is a challenge of political nature.The task of creating a space of cooperation in the areas of justice and the interior and managing the problem groups asylum, immigration and crime also has a deeply political character.This also applies to the implementation of a common security and defense policy.The solution is precisely because of the political character of these tasks.The political character means that questions of sovereignty are affected, which in turn causes the citizens and voters to react more sensitive.	de
Sixth and last: We proclaim that ETA's terrorism and violence should disappear and that it must stop kidnapping the will of Basque citizens, who, freely and without violent coercion, must be able to decide on their future.Just three months ago, I made use of the word in this assembly, like many other deputies, to congratulate the Irish and British for their success when reaching the Northern Ireland agreement.In Northern Ireland too many people have been dead and injured in the last thirty years ... too many shattered families.Until now, and unfortunately, in Spain and France, precisely the opposite has happened in relation to the existing conflict in the Basque Country.We, Euskal Eritark, are convinced that you can only find a definitive solution for the current fight through an open process of dialogue and negotiation without a limited day order.Before January 20, for nineteen months, the only violent death that we witnessed in the kingdom of Spain was that of José Luis Geresta, a member of ETA, in March 1999. Despite this and to the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, including those of the ETA negotiators with the Spanish government agreement, ETA respect the cessation of the unilateral fire.Then, last November, before the cessation of fire, the spokesman of the Spanish Government, Mr. Piqué, said that his government had done and would do everything possible in the future to hinder the current initiatives aimed at achieving a political solution in the Basque Country.We, Euskal Eritarrok, we have often lamented the loss of human lives.We share with all Basque citizens the sufferings of our people.We are committed to dialogue and willing to collaborate with all who are eager to find a democratic solution for the Basque Country.Twenty years have passed since the question of Northern Ireland was raised for the first time in this Parliament.Let me ask: What tandem - noiz art?Mrs. President, thank you very much for giving me the floor.I swear to me to speak now, after the intervention I just heard.When Colega Mr. Alonso Puerta has mentioned some victims of ETA, he did not appoint - and I think he did it out of respect for my person - a person who killed 16 years ago.A socialist senator, also Basque parliamentarian, whose name was Enrique Casas.(Strong applause) Mrs. President, Senator Enrique Casas was my husband.I was a widow with four children, of which the little one was eight months.The only fault that my husband had - which was Andalusian by birth, Basque Senator, sent by the Basque Government to defend the Basque Country in Madrid - was to be a socialist, but above all Democrat, nothing more than Democrat.I myself, Mrs. President, I have never talked about this in this assembly.Only the day ETA declared the truce welcomed him as hope for the entire Basque people and for all Spain and Europe.	es
The Council's declaration on the point of view of the European Union regarding the development of the Cyprus question;The report (A4-0029/2000) by Mr. Brok on behalf of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy for a Proposal for a Ordinance of Council on the implementation of measures in the context of the approach strategy for Cyprus and Malta (KOM (1999) 0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199 (CNS)).In representation of the council, Mr. Seixas has the floor.President, ladies and gentlemen!On behalf of the Council Presidency of the European Union, I would like to give some information about the resumption of inner -cypriotic negotiations and the latest development on this question.I think it is obvious to everyone that what happened in Helsinki at the end of last year, as well as the new climate, which is particularly noticeable in the relationships between the European Union and Turkey, is an expression of a background at community level, from which the actual framework of the relationship between the two population groups in Cyprus itself cannot remain untouched.I would like to emphasize that at the beginning of December of last year in New York, after several years of interruption, the first new round of negotiations between the Cypriot communities of the north and the south of the island took place.These negotiating rounds were indirect discussions, which were conveyed by the United Nations special representative, Álvaro de Souto.A second round of talks followed in January of this year, it was opened on January 31, and the beginning of a third round is planned for May 23 in New York.There is the possibility, which, however, has not yet been finally confirmed that these conversations can take place directly and continuously and that work will continue by September of this year.In this conversation, four content aspects were essentially discussed: the questions of security, the government structure, the regional adjustments and the refugee and compensation problems as a result of the situation that arose after the division of the island.However, since it was agreed that it would be possible to involve further questions, and so Urauf Denktasch, the representative of the northern part of the island, suggested three new theme complexes: the question of sovereignty, the question of confidence -building measures and the question of the abolition of the embargo against products from the north of the island.In the previous discussions there were essentially two developments: the opportunity to set up a direct information channel between the European Union and the northern part of the island is evident, without this inevitably means recognizing this island as a structure with its own legal personality at an international level.The goal is to facilitate the assumption of a joint acquis with a possible accession of the entire island, should it be possible in the meantime to solve the global problem of the division of the island.The second development that seems important to us consists in the explanation of the United Nations Secretary General at the end of the first day of the conversation, in which he assured that if one achieved an overall regulation of the situation, this would result in recognition of the peculiarities of the island order.This point of view that the United Nations General Secretary has represented is a factor that naturally has to incorporate into our future analysis.	de
It is an important step towards the European natural judge (which is one of our aspirations), based on mutual trust between Member States and between their respective judicial systems, on the trust of European citizens towards any European judge, but also on the scrupulous respect for freedoms and fundamental rights as well as, in particular, of the procedural guarantees.It is on this point that Parliament has rightly modified - in my opinion - the balance proposed by the Council, with a clear and resolute strengthening of these procedural guarantees in all its amendments.Mr. President, as noted by the speaker, Parliament has paid particular attention to a question, that of telephone interceptions, which he decided to suppress.On behalf of the European People's Party, I presented an amendment to the resolution in which the Council is asked to propose as soon as possible a text on the subject, since the absence of regulation is harmful.The regulation subject to our attention was incomplete, and therefore inadequate.However, the absence of rules could also lead - and in fact many times has led - to abuse in the field of telecommunications.Another point on which I would like to dwell, also widely discussed, concerns the use of videoconferences in the case of people who are investigated, accused, incriminated or processed.Also regarding this issue I asked, on behalf of the European People's Party, that the Council process as soon as possible an agreement that clarifies and complete the legislation, clearly insufficient.Mr. President, we members of the European People's Party, except for some exceptions, will vote in favor of the amendments approved in the commission and, of course, in favor of the amendments that we have presented.Mr. President, part of the construction of Europe passes, in our opinion, through the construction of a common legal system that includes an administrative right, a civil, substantial and procedural right, and a criminal, substantial and procedural right of Europe that we want to build.The Convention on judicial and criminal assistance, which we examine today, is only a piece of this great European Corpus Juris, which finds its natural foundation in the fundamental rights and freedoms of man.Therefore, judicial and criminal cooperation must also take place in a more rigorous respect for fundamental rights, principles that are the basis of our culture and our civilization: I think of the right trial, in particular of the rights of defense, the impartiality and thirdness of the judge, the length of the judicial procedures for which my country, Italy, unfortunately holds a negative record as regards the number of convictions, of the provisions of the European Court in front of the European Court.of man.The limitations of fundamental rights, which are justified as they are linked to a real or presumed violation of the criminal law, cannot and should not be applied in the fields of law.The report that the commission for the freedoms and rights of citizens has widely modified with respect to the setting originally given, welcoming many amendments presented by us, still arouses certain perplexities, linked to the way in which we intend to regulate the wiretapping and videoconferences.	it
However, the Court of Justice has not explicitly addressed the question of visa and a residence permit;Not even the Member States, consequently, were able to clarify these issues.On the other hand, even as regards the abolition of the work permit, the Member States in them have followed the provisions of the Court and still place the provisions of services beyond the inadmissible obstacles that are often insurmountable in particular for small entrepreneurs.As regards self -employed workers, the current community acquisis in the legal field does not provide that citizens of third countries can provide services across thever.A legislative intervention is therefore necessary.Both Directive projects aim to facilitate the free provision of services of companies in the European Union.These are not the rights originally from third countries of third countries attributable to freedom of circulation.All regulations, entry into the community and issues related to the stay must be considered rather in relation to the free provision of services.Like the legal commission and for the internal market of the European Parliament, they are therefore of the opinion that the legal basis chosen by the Commission is the right one while I do not find the opinion expressed in the report of the Council legal service valid.Therefore, in my opinion, there are no legal arguments that can prevent these two projects of directive to proceed quickly in their process within the Council.I also believe that the amendments proposed by Parliament with respect to the Commission's proposal should encourage the approval of the directives by the Board.Many of our amendments are re -established for perplexity also emerged in the council;And we therefore try to reconcile these perplexities with the mandate that derives from the legislation currently in force and from economic reasons.I can only appeal to the Commission so that it makes its own, possibly in their completeness, the amendments accepted by Parliament, even where these are considerably from the original proposals of the Commission.I am deeply convinced that on this basis we can more easily find an agreement in the council.And now let's move on to the most important amendments we proposed.One of the substantial differences consists of this: the current proposal refers to a system that provides for the issue of a service provision card and requires the indication of each individual assignment provided.Well, we propose to abolish the obligation to declare the host state every single assignment as it appears to be difficult to implement in practice.As a counterpart, of course, any difficulty must be resolved before the release of the aforementioned card.We therefore propose to make the requirements for the issue of the same.The evidence of regular employment, legal stay and insurance protection must not be provided only at the time of the release of the card but also during all its validity and for the following three months.In this way, it ensures the host state that the employee, or the autonomous one, once the assignment has been carried out, will actually return to the state of origin and that in cases of illness or accident they have insurance coverage.	it
In addition, problems of different nature occur within the regions.It is evident that the local and regional authorities are above all - and, consequently, to a lesser extent the national authorities - to be able to better evaluate the situation and formulate an adequate policy.Therefore I cannot support the project from this point of view to delegate the skills at European level.Employment policy in general should not be forgotten.Also in this case, the structure of the economy differs in the various Member States and the same is also valid for the ways in which the current level of employment has been achieved.It is not appropriate to apply a single type of policy, perhaps providing for many derogations and adjustments.This would mean that the European Union unjustly removes skills from the Member States and that Brussels' bureaucracy is frapported without any need between the two parts.It is better that the Member States themselves adopt measures aimed at promoting employment.Their knowledge of the situation is greater than that of the Commission.For this reason I am reluctant to formulate EU measures to encourage employment, also as regards the tourism sector.For us it is completely unacceptable that Parliament try to achieve this objective indirectly by expanding its skills.Mr. President, he will understand that we cannot vote in favor of the resolution in its current form.First of all, I would like to congratulate me with the honorable viceconte for the work done on the report, a very in -depth document that we support, as we had supported the original report on which the document is based, that is, that of the high -level group established by the European Commission.I hope the commission does not forget the group that has established and I hope that it wants to use it and you don't leave it unused in a corner.In the tourism sector, small companies operate essentially, and therefore it is a fertile area for the creation of employment.As has already been said during the debate, three million potential jobs within the next ten years are a goal that is worth pursuing.Europe can no longer refuse to grant to the sector of its economy that grows more quickly the recognition it deserves thanks to its economic and social position, and must do it both political and through appropriate measures.It is necessary to have a more dynamic vision, based on the contribution of tourism to the creation of jobs.We must recognize that the sector mainly deals with cross -border activities and therefore deserves a European policy with a stimulating, innovative and proactive approach aimed at a sustainable development of businesses.I know that the commissioner is a computer enthusiast, and I must say that he also infected me.Well, tourism and computer science are two sectors that are very good for agreement.There are therefore many reasons why the tourist industry can be considered as an ideal test bench to integrate new employment creation strategies.Let's examine these reasons in detail.The importance for the economy of tourism and its growth potential is evident.In the tourism sector, various population bands work, in particular the most vulnerable groups such as young people, women and unwillingly workers.	it
Every chairperson or chair has as many votes as the parliamentary group has members.There was a vote on this point.According to my memory, this coordination went out like this: 422 against 180 votes in a few abstentions.This means that all factions, with the exception of the lessons - but they are not a parliamentary group - agreed, only their faction was of the opinion that it was the case to proceed as they suggested here.Everyone else disagreed.That was the decision.Now I want to say something about the matter myself.We have confidence in the Commission, Romano Prodi, and the very large majority of our parliamentary group have given Romano Prodi and the Commission after a difficult process, as everyone knows, the trust.But we are also of the opinion that we have to conduct a debate about this commission's strategy in an orderly procedure, not only on the basis of an oral explanation here in the European Parliament, but also on the basis of a document that has been decided in the Commission and describes this program for five years.There is no such document!The Commission will present the program for the year 2000 in February.We said that if the Commission does not want to do the 2000 program in January, we will do it in February.We agreed.We do not want a dispute with the Commission in itself, but we believe that if possible, the Commission and Parliament have to go a common way.But we as a parliament are also the commission's controller.And not everything that comes from the Commission must be our opinion.I want us to be able to prepare for a debate about the five -year program in the political groups.You cannot prepare if you hear an explanation here and do not even know what the content of such an explanation is.That is why it is our recommendation - and my impression is that the Commission is also open -minded for this idea - that in February we will lead the debate about the long -term commission until 2005 - I hope that the Commission will also agree on a program that it will suggest to us - and that we will also lead the debate about the Commission's legislative program for the year 2000.So it is also a sensible factual connection that advises us to jointly discuss the debate about both programs.That is why my faction decidedly rejects the proposal of the socialist group!(Applause from the PPE-DE parliamentary group) I suggest that we vote on the application of the Social Democratic Group to put the Commission on the agenda of the Commission on the agenda.(The parliament rejects the application.) The President.On Wednesday I have another application regarding the oral request for capital tax.The PPE/DE faction requested that this point can be deducted from the agenda.Does anyone want to justify the application on behalf of the faction?Ms. President, since I hear a little laughter from the socialists - I was told that long circles of the socialist parliamentary group would also like to have this agenda item, because the vote of the working group of the responsible colleagues in the socialist group did not exist when coordinating the president's conference.	de
"I believe that the idea of ​​creating an observatory for the evolution of this coherence between community policies and the cooperation and development policy is sufficiently wise and relevant;Its scope should not be limited to community policies, but must also cover the actions or policies of the Member States, including the actions of economic groups, which seems important to me.Each year, this observatory will have to develop a report on the evolution and impacts of these policies and their conjugation.I left for the end a question which seems fundamental to me and which must be recorded and approved by this parliament.This new objective of minimizing contradictions between the policy of cooperation and development and other policies must be a valid objective not only within the European Union, but also at the world level, given the growing globalization of the economy.If we want a just global trade, we must impose this same principle on the next cycle of multilateral negotiations of the World Trade Organization of Trade, because it would be contradictory for the European Union to establish itself an iron discipline, but just, while the United States and other great powers would then do the opposite and approve of what we do not do.This is why it is fair and fundamental that these principles be established during the next cycle of the World Trade Organization.The President, the Director General of the DG of development said that producing a report on the coherence of EU policies with development policies, before the presentation, next spring, of the document on the development policy itself, was equivalent to placing the cart before the bugs.It does not matter if the Commission, subject to the requirement to produce an annual report, clearly established in the resolution of the council, produced only one ""non-documentary"".The real problem is that at the time of tackling world poverty, these bugs climb a coast and the trolley of other EU policies is so heavy that development policy is in fact gently pulled back.Many and many times, the development policy is forgotten or we only think of it after the fact, when the major policies of the European Union have already been examined.Take the new chocolate directive, which indicates that the EU countries spend more for chocolate each year than for development aid.This directive has not been the subject of any correct development evaluation and the producing countries, 90 % of which are our ACP partners, estimate that it could decrease the income of cocoa cultivators by at least 15 %.Take the fishing agreements, in which we recognize the non-durability of current fishing practices in UE waters.We are in the process of negotiating, at the same time, joint operations allowing reinforced access to European fishery ships in the waters of developing countries at the expense of 190 million small fishermen from these countries all over the world.Take business agreements.As Mr. Nielson said this morning about Lomé, preferential access only concerns all products from developing countries.In other words, when EU’s commercial interests are at stake, poverty considerations are volatilizing."	fr
Ladies deputies, this is what we are doing and that sees us engaged.I believe that we have worked well in recent months, in recent weeks and I believe that we will be able to work in the coming months of 2000 during the Portuguese B presidency that is truly carrying out a magnificent and extraordinary job B and continue during the French presidency which, without any doubt, will continue to work with the same concern and skills shown on other occasions.I wanted to say that in the meantime at least four European councils will take place, that of Lisbon, that of Feria as well as two European councils during the French presidency.On these four occasions, the heads of government are also willing to continue to analyze these aspects, in order not to lose the train and in order to be able to proceed, by 2003, to the deployment of what was agreed, if this is necessary.Therefore, honorable deputies, lady president, I believe that in this regard we are working with determination, with energy and with the great support of all governments and all leaders of government.Ladies deputies, I would like to say two other things on the subject.The European Union has the obligation to carry out this in contact with third countries to which I referred, countries which, despite being part of Europe from a geographical point of view, are not yet part of the European Union.They are countries with which we must work, that we must integrate, because in the event of a B crisis that obviously avoid all the forces and all the countries will be more than welcome.Secondly, we must be able to establish a fluid and transparent relationship with the Atlantic alliance.The operations that we will have to perform in the future will be of three types.The first type will be the operations that will engage the European forces in the framework of the Atlantic alliance.The second type of operations will use European forces and will be directed by them, but will use the means and infrastructures of the Atlantic alliance.The third type of operations provides that Europeans act alone.In the former and in the latter we will need the cooperation of the Atlantic alliance and, therefore, to establish a framework of transparent, positive and trust relationships between us and the Atlantic alliance, just as it must be, with mutual advantage of both the Atlantic alliance and ours.Lady president, honorable deputies, I talked about the skills that we are willing to start, of the calendar that we intend to apply and what has been done in recent months.I would also like to add that we do not forget that we will have to cope with crisis operations even in the civil sphere.Humanitarian crisis, crisis that involve the forces of the order, as unfortunately currently occur in Kosovo, in the Balkans: even all this we are giving or are trying to give solution in proportion to our skills.Together with the commission, together with Commissioner Patten, we are working in this sense.On Saturday morning I will meet with all the interior ministers of the fifteen member states of the European Union to try to show them the need that we all mobilize the police, because there are moments in which a crisis that starts with a military need develops in such a way that a few months later, more than the military are necessary, the police forces and more than the police, in the last phase of the crisis, are perhaps necessary.those democratic institutions that the country needs.	it
"The commitments that are badly failed for the interior are well highlighted for the outside.The way in which the commission faces to treat cohesion seems serious to me.In the background a principle of the treaties - that of economic and social cohesion - which must marks all the policies and measures of the European institutions, seems to ignore that serious delays persist in the European regions and forgets that the expansion justifies the precautions in regional policy.Without a real convergence, the cohesion of the European Union is made at risk.Let's remember the sixth periodic report on the situation of the regions of the European Union, drawn up by the Commission.In that document it is confirmed that, for an average level of development to which the degree of 100 is attributed, the ten regions defined as ""stronger"" reach an average of 158 and the ten defined ""weaker"" are at 50. Take the conclusions.50 is exactly the level of development of the region from which I come, the Azores, a region defined as an ultra -aperitical in the treaties.I am waiting for the report that the Council commissioned the Commission to process by December 1999. I conclude, reaffirming my belief that without economic and social cohesion there will be no type of cohesion but only disintegration.Mrs. President, Mr. President, we need, that is, the European public opinion needs, of a strong commission since, in the form desired by the treaties, just as the will of the peoples wanted it, the commission is the engine of the European construction, this sort of boulder of Sisyphus who together, after each expansion, we must start to push towards the top.Strong commission, therefore, but which leans on a parliament, parliament that is therefore your ally, although a little uncomfortable, whose messages must be grasped and taking advantage of this brief intervention I would like to send a couple of it.First of all, Mr. President, I believe that if his two predecessors have essentially dedicated themselves to building an internal market and to introduce the single currency, it is enough for her rather to develop all the civic value at the center of the European construction.In fact, she must not be absorbed by the problem of expansion, regardless of its importance.It will be necessary to go further, towards the reconciliation between citizen and Europe and, in this case, between citizens victims of economic, social fractures and tomorrow certainly also technological.The market and competition will not guarantee the promotion of scientific development, new technologies and access to them, nor the availability and social efficacy of large collective services, such as health, education, transport, communications, water and so on.Its action program, its objectives are reserved, not to say the silence, precisely on the necessary relaunch of public investments.They are also discreet, not to mention Muti, on the consolidation and financing of great public services and of general interest.This is an absolute priority, Mr. President, if you intend to reconcile Europe and citizens and make sure that they choose Europe instead of Jörg Haider.Mrs. President, the Commission rightly made food safety one of its priorities."	it
It was this time too, but I consider a little excessive to dwell so much about these 100 amendments.I would also like to remind you that our coordinator in the Commission for the Budget Control is the Honorable Pomés Ruiz, coming from Spain, who provided the debate with an important contribution from the Spanish side.Mr. President, one of the most important elements among those mentioned is the proposal of the speaker to establish a permanent committee that takes care of the parameters applicable to the Public Administration.It is a very important proposal.It only surprises me that the socialist group attacks it by contrasting a proposal from the honorable Morgan who aims to delete it completely.The situation is not clear to me.On the one hand, the praise to the address of the speaker are multiplying, on the other, the honorable Morgan, on this point as on others, follows a burnt ground strategy aimed substantially to cancel the entire content of the relationship.I don't know if the intent of this strategy is to meet Commissioner Kinnock.However, I know Commissioner Kinnock;I know that he wants to listen to our requests and is willing to then distance himself, if he believes it necessary.I do not consider such a burnt ground strategy indispensable.Finally, I would like to refer to the issue of officials.I absolutely do not agree with Mr Haarder.I instead agree in saying that the text relating to officials is not enough at all.First of all, the emphasis is placed on the importance of the general public service, and secondly a series of proposals is listed, regarding which one wonders if they are reasonable or if they actually lead to improvements.For example, we have dealt with the BAT, an important point, but at the same time we want to eliminate the temporary staff of the Commission.These two proposals are contradictory and I cannot understand how they have been presented.Mr. President, since the time of the Republic of Plato, the western world has been systematically attempted to replace the government of essays in the government of the people.Already on a first occasion our Parliament asked for the assistance of the essays to evaluate the work of the European Commission, and they took the opportunity to decide their fate.In this second relationship, the essays go even further, criticizing the political groups of this parliament that would have hesitated to accept the resignation of the European Commission due to the common political affiliation of some of its members and claiming that the problem can be solved by imposing on the commissioners to renounce any political belonging.Also according to the essays, Parliament should renounce the control prerogatives of the European Commission and should be replaced in this task by a guarantee committee of good costumes in public life, a permanent and non -elective body, presumably constituted by another group of essays.In their second relationship, the essays teach us that Italy is financed by the Cohesion Fund, that two thirds of the structural funds are intended for the ERDF and the social fund, that in the structural funds the principle of additionality and the principle of complementarity are equivalent, that the agricultural lobby requires the financing of the development of the rural world through the Feaog guarantee section and that the principle of partnership is applied only to the Commission and the Member States.	it
I would like to remind you that the first -mentioned urban initiative pursues the goal of improving the quality of life of the citizens who live in different cities in Europe, while the second, Interreg, promoting cohesion and the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union should recognize and at a time when the regions are in extreme outskirts are about to be included in chapter B and C.Like the rapporteur, we also regret that chapter IIIa was excluded.In terms of Interreg, we are very appropriate to refer to the establishment of a European observation center for the effects of the cooperation.We thank the ladies and gentlemen, especially Mr. Decourrière, for the empathy in terms of regional policy and for taking into account our amendments.I hope that the Lord commissioner accepts our proposal.President!In connection with the various initiatives that we discuss this afternoon, I would like to strictly limit myself to a consideration of a program, to urban.One thing is certain: just because the European Parliament stubbornly insisted on continuing this initiative, we debate about this program today.The Commission's intention was to let this and other initiatives expire.However, the proposal of the parliament and the timely insight of the Commission should be thanked for urban.I think we can congratulate each other.But what arguments did the Commission, in the specific case, have given Ms. Commissioner Monika Wulf-Mathies and the General Director, Mr. Eneko Landaburu, for the expiry of urban?They had a convincing argument.Urban questions are too important to limit them to a program with very low center equipment.Today we have the program, I think we have achieved something important: Urban has become an identity -creating sign in the European Union.But I would like to say to Commissioner Barnier that I share the argument of the Commissioner and the Director General, because they were right.The urban dimension has to find its way into all structural funds much more.In view of the household funds that our cities need -80 % of the European population live there, and there are the good and bad examples of what there are in Europe -I believe that this European dimension must be taken into account and that this urban program must not be the justification for not to analyze the problems comprehensively, not to set priorities and therefore do not provide a much higher budget for programs in connection with citiesAs part of all European funds.Therefore, I think that it is not necessary to check the number of factors that justify this investment in urban areas.The factors are known and I would like to tell the Lord Commissioner that we count on his understanding in this regard.The cross-sectoral approach anchored in the new equal initiative is to be welcomed.At the same time, however, it is of crucial importance that the program makes something against the significant discrimination, which affects disabled people in particular: physical obstacles in the workplace, to which people with limited mobility, visual information systems that cannot be used by blind workers, in which people with learning weaknesses or mental illness have no chance.	de
The implementation of this component is the responsibility of the Member States and the national authorities;And the C section which organizes interregional cooperation between different regions of Member States or third countries by networking experiences concerning aspects of A and B as well as cooperation in the field of research, technological development, subject to defining with the European Commission, which is responsible for its implementation.The new Interreg program, as it has been transmitted to us, takes into account the needs generated by enlargement to the PECO and the island and ultraperipheral regions.The Commission offers us to distribute the endowment of Interreg as follows: from 50 to 80 % for component A, 6 % for the C section, the difference for the B section, that is to say from 14 to 44 % to the maximum.The European Commission establishes the list of regions eligible for component A and Bite B. It was essentially based on the map of eligible regions during the previous programming period.Ultraperipheral regions can benefit from support for component B. The Commission establishes a list of priority areas and eligible non -exhaustive measures for component A, but exhaustive for component B. It reserves the right to subsequently propose themes that it considers important for experience exchange and reinforced cooperation between regions, for the C.Programs are set by the general regulations on structural funds.The proposals are established by the Member States and submitted for approval to the European Commission which verifies their compliance with the general orientations selected.These proposals must include a certain number of elements, an overview of cross -border or transnational strategies and priorities, a description of the measures necessary for their implementation and an indicative financing plan.I am part of the vast majority of parliamentarians who voted for the maintenance of the Interreg community initiative program.I regret that the Parliament was not informed of the evaluation of the previous program - which would have enabled an optimal efficiency of the new measures implemented, but I know the difficulty of this operation -, I also regret an extremely short work calendar, since the text was examined in parliamentary committee on November 24 and January 26, and I also regret that neither the regions nor the representative regional organizationsprogram.By promoting cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation, this transversal instrument is the very embodiment of a regional policy of European dimension favorable to a harmonious and balanced development of the community.Madam President, Dear colleagues, Gentlemen and Ladies The Commissioners, the Conference on Rural Development, which was held in Cork from November 7 to 9, 1996, defined rural development as one of the priorities of the European Union, since an event in agriculture, to support the existence and continuous development, to provide farmers with an environment endowed with the necessary infrastructures and services, also essential for better respect for the environment and better quality of lifeFinally for the diversification and creation of workstations.	fr
"That said, we can positively assess the different organization of guidelines which, leaving aside geographic objectives, are intended for sectoral policies.If, in theory, this can meet the requirements of concentration and therefore the effectiveness of interventions, a question arises of itself, the question of whether the current situation of the regions of objective 1 allows in fact a policy of integrated interventions, which requires an operational instrument of coordination of the sums allocated.We could then in principle respond even positively to the request of the Commission which wants to create a management center for structural promotion in the Member States responsible for coordinating the application and management of structural interventions on site, provided that this center does not become a centralizing instrument of supranational level and guarantees that effective attention is paid to these regions which - I reiterate it once againStill reached correct levels in the use of structural funds, so that the replacement of the geographical objective with sectoral policies could lead to a negative intervention in fact.The guidelines, as approved by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of responding to the objective aimed at indicating orientations, they provide a catalog of possible provisions, a catalog which, in the absence of a progressive definition of priorities, could squarely put the Member States on a false way by directing them towards a range of proposals contrary to the concentration sought.You could say that in the current state of things, we have still lost the opportunity to effectively strengthen sustainable urban development containing the growing phenomenon of urbanization and degradation of the related landscape.We have not correctly estimated the importance of the instrument of the global subsidy which could prove to be very useful to rebalancing between urban and rural areas by conferring, in addition, dignity which is essential to local organizations which, by their autonomy, could define conditions of territorial development including shorter deadlines, thus contributing to the efforts of reform of structural funds and the objectives of efficiency, concentration and objectivesadministrative relaxation.Rural space must really be considered a resource in which it is necessary to invest more and more, by encouraging young people to stay in rural regions to avoid their economic and social destruction.We now know that, to achieve this goal, it will be necessary to create, in rural areas, jobs no longer linked to agriculture as it is traditionally envisaged - which however constitutes an essential instrument for safeguarding the environment and biodiversity - but in sectors such as rural tourism, sport, culture, environment, small and medium -sized enterprises or services.We note in the guidelines a real vacuum due to the lack of concrete orientations in order to ensure coordination between the ESF and the strategies for employment, coordination which, since it is applied precisely for the first time for the 2000-2006 programming period, presupposes that the Member States need ""guidelines""."	fr
I therefore plead in favor of maintaining what was planned: debate Friday, vote later.Madam President, I owe an explanation to Mr. Wurtz and I will provide it to the whole parliament.We had reached this agreement in principle at the Conference of Presidents.At that time, I did not know that the commissioner, Mr. Bolkestein, was going to tackle the subject next week during his hearing by the Commission of Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism.In addition, we have debated the question within my group and we think, given the current situation in the entire process of market integration and deregulation on such a sensitive subject, that the Parliament should be done in the future, pronounces first so that the commissioner, Mr. Bolkestein, takes good note and to guide the debate next week.Madam President, I would simply like to invite my colleague Wurtz to reread and check what it is.It is not a substantive discussion here, but simply the following question: when the commission will finally be able to present the directive, when it has already had a year and a half to do this?Thanks to this resolution, we only want the deadlines to which the Commission had granted to be respected.Therefore, it is important that we act as quickly as possible.This is why I would like to support the proposal made by the Social Democrats to vote this Friday.(The Parliament marks her agreement) Madam President, the Cederschiöld report no longer on the agenda of the Thursday session, we should that day have a little more time.Given the number of subjects that will have to be debated in an hour and a half, the emergency session may be very tight.Could not the service of the acts of the plenary session check if it is possible to grant us an additional half hour for the emergency session, so that we have sufficient speaking time?Last week, the organization of the session seems to me to have been very chaotic.We had a very tight timing in terms of speaking time, then suddenly, last Thursday, we ended up with a void on the agenda for an hour, even an hour and a half.We had to wait until the vote.This Friday, only one subject is on the agenda.It is completely absurd.I would urgently want to examine the organization of the session.This is one thing that is quite possible: so if we can extend the emergency session for half an hour, given the withdrawal of Ms. Cederschiöld's report.This is good that it is and only that.Madam President, I wanted to intervene in relation to the agenda on Wednesday, which you did not announce.	fr
This is the correct procedure.President!According to Article 69 (2), I apply for the transfer to the committee.The reason is that this is the alignment of a legal provision that the Commission proposed.We accepted this, but proposed further alignment of the legal provisions that affect this directive, above all to use and identify genetically modified organisms.We believe that this belongs to this adjustment at this point, but the commission does not take over.I think we have to try to talk to the Commission in accordance with Article 69 (2), and that's why I ask my colleagues to agree to the return transfer.(The parliament accepts the application for a transfer to the committee.) Report (A5-0034/2000) by Ms. Stenzel on behalf of the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs on the Commission on the Member States to determine the guidelines for programs in the context of community initiatives (PGI), for which the member states can submit suggestions for support in the Equal initiative (COM (COM (COM))476 - C5-0260/1999 - 1999/2186/COS)) Before the vote: Mr. President, let me publicly say Ms. Stenzel as a member of the board of the ÖVP that many MPs are horrified that you have received a coalition with Haider and that we want to condemn this here!(Applause from left, interjection from right) Dear Mr. Cohn-Bendit, Hohes Haus!I think the European Parliament is not the place to intervene in the domestic policy of a country as massively as they do!I can speak for my party, which was a pioneer for the fact that Austria joined the European Union and joined.As a political force, we are the guarantee that Austria remains connected to European values.I refuse to have myself put in a right corner for internal and party political reasons!This does not correspond to the facts, but is pure polemics!I reject this with determination!(Lively, long -lasting applause from the middle and right, protest from left) I would like to take the opportunity to welcome a delegation of four members of the Moroccan Parliament under the direction of Mr. Brahim Rachidi, Vice President of the House of Representatives.We look forward to visiting this delegation so shortly before the entry into force of the association agreement between Morocco and the European Union on March 1, 2000. On the occasion of this historical step, we welcome the developments in our relationships and the prospect of intensifying the contacts between our two parliaments.For this purpose, a delegation for relationships with the Maghreb countries and the Union of the Arab Maghreb will travel to Morocco from March 20 to March 22.I wish the delegation a successful stay in Strasbourg.(Lively applause) Mr President, since you are greeting a delegation, I would like to take the opportunity to tell you that today we also have the pleasure of welcoming the main responsible for the Austrian associations against racism in our house that have given parliament the honor of their visit.	de
In the new program presented for the period 2000-2006, financed by the European Social Fund, the resources used and the policies implemented must be aimed, with the support of the Commission, to the achievement of the objectives I have mentioned.The Commission will carefully follow the work of the Hellenic government for the respect of the commitments that it has taken on.I thank the commissioner for his reply.However, Mrs. Diamantopoulou, the situation we are in is the following.We have the second highest unemployment rate in Europe, i.e. 11.3 percent - in the past it was not so high -, we have the highest rate of increase in the number of work without work, we are the country that spends less for the unemployed, that is, less than 1 percent of the GDP while the other countries spend between 3 and 4 percent (such as France, Belgium and Germany), and it is not at all clear how it isallocations of the social fund provided, among other things, also for the fight against unemployment.You tell me that the Commission has formulated certain recommendations.I take note of it, and I rejoice: we hope that the recommendations will be respected!For some time, however, I ask myself a question: and the policies adopted previously?Some have found work?And if so, how many?At least last year and two years ago, if you cannot provide us with the data for this year.And of the formation, what was it?Are the famous training centers to give work to trainers or staff in training?Do we have figures available?In short, do we have the opportunity to at least control the trend of this Hellenic government policy?Mr Papayanannakis, I can reply that the Greek government at this point will really have to intensify its commitment for the computerized management of statistical data and for the creation of structures that allow the programs implemented to translate into quantitative results, as she says, and that allow a true monitoring according to which to subsequently orient the policies.Greece has recorded an increase in the unemployment rate and, to what I see from these data, an increase in productivity.What the Commission can do concerns the guidelines in question.As you know, the directors on the basis of which each country is judged are 22 and concern, among other things, access to training, its numerical distribution between men and women, the specific interventions for long -lasting unemployed.On all these guidelines, the Commission will strive to quantify the data and to have exact figures, and this on the basis of the realization of the new community framework for 2000-2006.Question n.36, of the honorable (H-0782/99): object: the Danish early early retirement program is able to let the Dane of early early retirement program be fully approved or if there are still divergences between Denmark and the Commission, as regards other social sectors?The Danish retirement system, the Efterløn, only allows the retirement of those who reside in Denmark and of those who have completed the work periods required in this country.Some workers have submitted a complaint to the European Commission, denouncing to see their pension rights denied.	it
In the case of Sweden, the excisees are actually used to reduce the consumption of alcohol.Although this leads to an increase in the increases between Sweden and other Member States of the Union - and that as such, it increases the transfective smuggling of alcoholic products - it is a legitimate instrument to reduce the consumption of alcohol.Of course, there is the elasticity of demand;In this case, the elasticity of the price of demand.I am not quite sure of its value but it is not zero and it must therefore have an effect.My question would have been almost identical to that raised by Mr. Purvis but I would like to push further argument.By admitting, as you have said, that the accused rights are a prerogative of the Member States, the fact remains that the use of this prerogative in a discriminatory and inequitable manner with regard to producers of a part of the community vis-à-vis other producers can come into conflict with the principle of the single market.For example, if we consider what M. Purvis and I think -to the regions of whiskey highlands, which are particularly peripheral regions of Europe, subject to strong pressure, where communities practicing agriculture and distillation depend entirely on this production -, the general practice which aims to tax the alcohol contained in the Scottish Whisky,Danish aquavit more strongly than the alcohol contained in beer or wine seems to me to be discriminatory and fall under discriminatory use of a practice commonly recognized as the prerogative of the Member States..Let me confirm to Mr. Maccormick and other members of this Parliament that the current situation, in which the increases differ between the Member States, is indeed not likely to promote the proper functioning of the internal market.We must not limit ourselves to alcoholic products.If we consider essence, for example, we see that the excisees perceived in Germany are different from those perceived in the Netherlands: it follows that the Dutch drivers cross the border and refuel in Germany.It is indeed a distortion of the internal market.If he only died, I will use a magic wand to harmonize the excisees in Europe.This would result in the end of any smuggling, unless products are intrinsically more expensive in certain Member States.But I don't have a magic wand and it doesn't just want me.It is an area subject to unanimity, as Mr. Maccormick knows, and unless all of the Member States agree on the harmonization of the increases, it will not take place.Once again, the Commission will submit, towards the end of the year, a report on the inventory in terms of excise and it goes without saying that I am arranged to any discussion with the Parliament about this report.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.Today, we are going to take care of you and offer you a drink - or two, perhaps - of Alsace wine, whose taxation we do not know, although I suppose it will also be struck with high taxes.The time scheduled for the time of questions to the Commission being exhausted, questions 55 to 114 will receive written answers.	fr
The national of a third state benefiting from a legal status in a Member State must also be admitted to other Member States.This does not prevent these states from taking public order measures within the framework of the proposed prior notification obligation.The commission also unacceptable the proposal to maintain the legal status three months after the expiration of the card.It is unacceptable that the national concerned can remain in the host country after the end of his service.This is why the Commission supports, in these two respects, the amendment 22 of Mrs. Palacio.With regard to the second proposal, the Commission includes the wish of a clear definition of the independent concept and it therefore intends to bring a solution to it in its modified proposal.These are some preliminary remarks on the most important amendments.I hope you will give me a new opportunity, at the end of the debate and after all the speakers are expressed, to extend to the various amendments.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, during the vote of tomorrow, the PPE group will support a large majority of the amendment proposals for the Legal Commission as well as the editorial modifications.I will limit my intervention to two areas.The first field is the question of what this directive should have the literal sense of the word.On the one hand, there are the interests of the economy and the individual.Let's say immediately that my explanations start from the principle that it is an honest individual and a conscientious worker.On the other hand, there is the interests of the Member States which may be considering the worst on the people concerned.If we are considering one of the extremes, the interests of the Member States, there are certainly good reasons for providing obstacles quite high in the issuance of this card.Then there are good reasons to justify the quick introduction, despite this card, notification obligations.If I plan the other extreme, namely as many obstacles as possible, I run the risk that this procedure deprives me of any legislation because the Member States will not give the directive.At the end of the day, either I will have a directive on the service provision of services that no one will have in fact because the obstacles placed in the economic sector will be too large, or I will not even have a directive.None of the two results can satisfy us.This may also be the reason why we are told that negotiations also wedge on this subject to the council.We have tried to find a balance, a solution as light as possible, between the interest that constitutes public order and the other interest.We want to have a solution that dismantles certain obstacles placed in the economic sector but which allows you to reach, once these obstacles have been overcome, an application as light as possible.This is why we want a service service to be requested for one or for several Member States.If a French firm declares that one of its employees must work permanently in Denmark and only in Denmark, the service card should be able to be requested for this country alone.	fr
"This observatory must annually process a report on the evolution and impact of these policies and coordination.I last left a question that seems fundamental to me and that I think should be put to the documents and approved by the Assembly.This goal of minimizing the contradictions between the policy of cooperation and development and the remaining policies must be valid not only within the European Union, but also worldwide, given the growing globalization of the economy.If we want a fair world trade, we must affirm this principle within the next cycle of multilateral negotiations in the world organization of trade, because it would be contradictory that the European Union imposed a iron discipline, even if right, and let the United States and the other great powers did the opposite, taking advantage of our restraint.It is therefore right and indispensable that these principles are sanctioned in the next negotiation cycle to the World Trade Organization.Mr. President, the general manager of DG Development said that developing a report on the coherence of the European Union policies with development policy, before the document on the development policy itself provided for spring, is like putting the wagon in front of the oxen.Leaving aside the fact that the request to produce an annual report, clearly addressed to the Commission in the resolution of the Council, has produced only a ""non-document"", the real problem is that when it comes to alleviating poverty in the world those oxen proceeds uphill and the chariot of the other union policies is so heavy that they slowly take back the development policy.When examining the main policies of the European Union, development policy is often forgotten or constitutes a simple rethinking.We take the new directive on chocolate, from which it appears that the countries of the Union every year spend more chocolate than in development.No careful evaluation of the impact on the development of this directive was made which, according to the producing countries, for 90 percent of our partners ACP, can reduce the revenue of cocoa farmers at least 15 percent.We take the agreement on fishing, in which we recognize the unsustainability of current fishing methods in the waters of the European Union.In parallel, we are concluding joint venture agreements to allow large European fishing ships with greater access to the waters of developing countries, against 190 million fishermen on a small scale present in these countries.Let's take the commercial agreements.As commissioner Nielson said this morning about Lomé, preferential access is essentially granted for all products of the less advanced countries.In other words, when the commercial interests of the European Union are at stake, the considerations on poverty jump out of the window.In the position we take in Seattle, why this silence on the inability of the union to apply commercial concessions in favor of developing countries already decided in the framework of the Gatt, including those relating to the crucial sector of the textile industry?As regards the common agricultural policy, on which the major faults fall, no evaluation of the impact on the development of the PAC reforms provided for by Agenda 2000 has been carried out. All are now aware of the scandal of the return regime to the export, which has unloaded on the markets of western Africa an excess of 54 000 tons of subsidized cattle, reducing the prices recognized by the rates recognized by halflocal."	it
"We ask the Commission to check these proposals again.Finally, we would like to emphasize the MPs of voting capital requirements, especially against amendment, as we believe that this would be very bad for the industry.I would like to notice that I am the first member to stay within his time limit.President, Pecunia Non Olet, said the Latin.What matters is that the money increases.This is the only point where we bring the interest of the economists into agreement with the interest of all those who want to earn and only have the dollars in the head, like Dagobert Dug, which is shown with the dollar sign instead of the eyes, only that in the present case it is the euro sign.Here we bring together the interest of these citizens and the interest of the pensioners who want to lead a carefree life.For example, my brother -in -law, who lives in Rome, has become a pensioner a year ago, and since then he has been pursuing the development of pension funds and securities in the television screen until midnight on the television.The pensioners will have huge amounts of money in the future.While the young arms are swallower, the old money has accumulated and because they want to multiply it, they are very interested in this guideline.If the national governments - like the European Union with this guideline - the increase in money earned in the course of working life would be concerned, the burning problem of the pension explosion would have already been solved.You, Commissioner Bolkestein, also have a very great responsibility for the future of the elderly people and pensioners, a future that I hope that you will be better after we will have passed this guideline in accordance with the proposal of colleagues Villiers and Kauppi as quickly as possible.Mr President, First of all, on behalf of the Commission, I would like to thank the rapporteur, Mr. Olle Schmidt, and the members of the leading committee for economy and currency.My thanks also go to Mr. Brian Crowley as the author of the statement and the members of the Committee on Law and internal market for their recognition and intensive efforts to design and expand the proposals.Since the adoption of Directive 85/611, the capital and securities market has steadily developed, so that the applicable provisions must now be adapted accordingly.The new proposals are aimed at maintaining a uniform minimum level in investor protection, which is an essential prerequisite for the integration of the markets as a result of the introduction of the euro.Since the European average family creates their savings in investment funds, the proposals contain provisions for prudent administration - I would particularly like to underline this - for a prudent administration in terms of investment policy and risk scattering.The two suggestions form a coherent whole.The first proposal extends the instruments in which an ""organism for common systems in securities"" - OGAW - can invest.As already explained, Ogaw are among the most important actors on the modern financial markets."	de
This is why it is necessary to focus your attention on politicians - Mr. Karas also spoken about it - which lead to the overvaluation of such or such a currency in relation to its effective potential.However, this would require control measures for the import and export of capital, otherwise we cannot focus on these policies.The Tobin tax therefore seems a judicious idea, but it is not devoid of problems, even if we managed to put it in place, which, I repeat, I doubt.It should be remembered that in the current state of things, money is above all information, and that in the future the world economy will turn more and more to the strength of knowledge and intellectual capital.It is for this reason that the uninterrupted flow of colossal fortune masses between the financial centers of the world is not purely a speculative activity entirely disconnected from the real economy.If we obstruct by measures of the genus of the Tobin tax this feedback mechanism, which therefore gives users possibilities to make choices, this can have as a result of erroneous choices whose economic cost will be much higher than what the tax would ever harvest.This is why, as Mr. Kalas already explained, our group is absolutely opposed to the adoption of the Tobin tax.Madam President, I intervene in favor of taxation of capital movements for speculative purposes across monetary borders.It seems to me that we can no longer obvious that an action is necessary.In the past 30 years, the volume of monetary transactions has increased by 83 with the following results: first, the total, on a global scale, of central banks barely equals the daily volume of transactions on the exchange markets;Second, the annual world volume of real trade in goods and services is equivalent to exactly three and a half days, out of 350, speculation on the exchange markets, which means that the exchanges of goods and services represent 1 % of capital movements, against 99 % for speculation.Given the unpredictable and irrational scale of world exchange markets, it is increasingly difficult to manage national and regional economies.Computer transactions programs have transformed a marginal phenomenon into a surge, taking on jobs, lives and industries over its passage throughout the planet.The only argument against the taxation of speculative capital movements is that it would undermine the effectiveness of the exchange markets: a somewhat bizarre argument if one thinks of the frenzy that has taken up markets, destroying jobs all over the world, as well in the East Asian as in Europe and in Latin America.Mr. Chirac qualified those who participate in this frenzy of AIDS virus in the world economy.What is needed is to put sticks in the wheels of monetary speculators, exchange agents and sellers of options.It is of course not feasible on the scale of a country, or even on the scale of the euro zone, but it could be done worldwide, with good international cooperation.Europe, Japan and the United States, the Euro, the Yen and the Dollar, would in my opinion constitute a sufficient block.The PPE group disappoints me.	fr
"In the negotiations, the Commission must strive to include each applicant as quickly as possible in the Union.On the other hand, it must be ensured that the previous successes of the integration and the goals continued are not watered down.To prevent this, the Liberals' faction has expressed hope that the government conference will discuss models for a differentiated integration and that a concentric union is created in which there is a state as a core, around which a less integrated outer circle is grouped.It is foreseeable that the inner differentiation of the Union is discussed at the government conference.When treating this question, impartiality is required.A technical improvement in the flexibility system is not sufficient, rather the development of own institutions for the avant-garde countries must be sought, as Jacques Delors had already proposed.A decision -making system with more efficiency, clarity, transparency and democracy could be created.I hope that the Commission will submit its own proposal to how the institutional and other differentiation of the expanding Union should be implemented.Ms. President, Mr Commission President, Dear Commissioners!From her inspiring speech, Mr. Prodi, I let myself be tempted.It arouses expectations, but can also disappoint.This is due to the discrepancy between words and deeds, which Mr. Van Velzen has just pointed out.The expansion of the Union is supported by our desire for peace, security and stability.They want to calm the accession countries as well as the European public.However, we can convince ourselves with our own eyes how the exact opposite occurs today.Fear and unrest also spread in the regions that are almost spared and unemployed.As Mr. Swoboda says, and so I agree with him, we have to convey the feeling of our citizens that they can feel at home.Here is the same values ​​to us, and here everyone knows their tasks and responsibilities.This is probably due to the norms mentioned by Mr. van Dam.That is subsidiarity.Clearly defined powers at all decision -making levels, partnership instead of competition in politics.It is as possible for the citizens where transparency is preserved and the citizens themselves have the possibility of control.This requires a new political culture, not only in theory, but also in practice, which is based on reality in the member states and regions.Regions that are sometimes equally equal due to their cultural and economic importance.The new Europe must not only develop into the width, its progress must also go deep by actually living our values ​​and driving the democratic structure of a real community.The Commission will have to be measured by this.Ms. President, the Commission, today presents our strategic goals for the years 2000-2005 in an extremely general document, in which all sticking points are covered in order not to scare any side too much.In the first part you will of course not find the words federal or super state anywhere about the new European decision structures.However, these terms are inevitably emerging when there is talk of strong European institutions in which only the ongoing executing activities are decentralized and that develop their collective vision in a confused structure in which the governments and national parliaments are mixed with the regional and even local authorities and civil society, all of which without any ranking - ""Integral component of the EuropeanDecision structures ""."	de
"Therefore, the European Union has to be clearly related to the current situation in Austria..(SV) We voted for the joint resolution to give our solidarity with all expression that is exposed to xenophobia and racism, and also in protest against the loyal policy for which Jörg Haider stands.However, we reject the methods of the 14 Member States on this question.The resolution lacks a clear indication of the respect for national identity and legal traditions in accordance with Article 6 of the Treaty.We also miss a point for the joint responsibility of the EU for social and political development in Europe and Austria, which was one of the prerequisites for Haider's election success.Right -wing extremism - today, as in the previous history of Europe - is the result of uncertain social and economic living conditions.The austerity policy carried out in the course of the WWU adjustment has promoted the success of right-wing extremism.A radical policy for security and justice in every country is the best guarantee of democratic development in Europe.- I give this explanation on behalf of the CSU group.It is unbearable that the EU interferes in the government formation of a Member State.This is not entitled to the EU.Instead of making a prejudice of the FPÖ and the government of Austria, a critical examination and evaluation of the government declaration and the party program and the policy of the coalition are required.Only after such a critical examination of the future policy of the parties in coalition discussions can be decided whether this government contradicts the democratic spirit of Europe.This does not mean that we sympathize with Haider.The CSU European MPs have no sympathy for the FPÖ boss Haider.As a politician, we have to ask ourselves why 27 % of the Austrian population chose a party like the FPÖ in October 1999.We have to deal with the reasons for this and try to remove the reasons that lead to such results.Only an examination of the arguments and politicians of the FPÖ can prevent the radicalization of politics in Austria.The resolution of the European Parliament, on the other hand, does not question the reasons for the Austrian election result and shows no possible solution.For these reasons, the CSU European group group speaks against this resolution.""Because he knew what this happy crowd was unknown and what it says in the books: that the plague bacillus never dies out or disappears, but can slumber in the furniture and laundry for decades, that he is waiting patient in rooms, basements, carpenters, handkerchiefs and old papers and may come to the accident and the plague to the misfortune and again.Submit so that they die in a happy city.That racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear of the other and its rejection, which have their roots in the lowest essential features of humans, can revive at any time in any group of people and to gain domination."	de
This means that all the political groups, with the exception of non -members - which however do not constitute a political group - had agreed and that only one group was of the opinion of proceeding as proposed by his colleague here.All the others were of different opinion and so it was decided.I would now like to enter the merits briefly.We have confidence in the commission, in Romano Prodi and the vast majority of our political group, as everyone knows, after a difficult trial he voted for the trust in Romano Prodi and the Commission.However, we are also of the idea that the commission's strategy must be discussed during a regular procedure, not only on the basis of a declaration issued orally in this parliament but also on the basis of a document adopted by the Commission that illustrates this program for the next five years.But such a document does not yet exist!The Commission will present the program for 2000 in February.We agreed: if the commission does not want to discuss the 2000 program in January we will do it in February.It is certainly not our intention to conflict with the Commission.On the contrary, we think that as far as possible the Commission and Parliament must travel a common road.Parliament, however, also exercises control functions against the Commission and not everything that is proposed by the latter must necessarily find us agree.I wish that inside the political groups we could prepare us adequately for the debate on the five -year program.It is not possible to do it by listening to a declaration which we do not know exactly the content.Therefore we recommend - and I have the impression that the Commission is also willing to welcome this idea - to discuss the long -term program of the Commission in February which extends until 2005 - hoping that at that point the Commission has agreed on a program that will submit - and, always in February, also the legislative program of the Commission for the year 2000. It is therefore on the basis of an objective link that we propose to discuss the two programs at the same timePolitician definitely rejects the proposal of the socialist group!(Applause from the benches of the Ppe-de group) Mrs. President, I would like to clearly affirm that, first of all, the Commission nourishes the utmost respect for the decisions of Parliament including that of elaborating its agenda.Therefore, we respect any decisions on Parliament.But I want to say the same that President Prodi has committed himself to Parliament to insert a new debate, as the Mr Barón recalled, in addition to the annual debate on the Commission's legislative program, on the great lines of action for the next five years, that is, for this legislature.I want to underline, Mrs. President, that, according to the agreement concluded last September, this debate was distinguished from the presentation of the Commission's legislative program.And I would like to let us know that, as regards the commission, we are ready and willing to keep this debate when it is deemed appropriate;We were ready to do it this week, in accordance with the initial agreement, based on the agreement of a presentation of the speech to parliamentary groups the day before.	it
It is unfortunate, in my opinion that the Commission has not made the same balance of Leader II, balance on the quality of the projects, the number of credits consumed and first of all about the demobilization of some local agents against the administrative and financial obstacles found.However, I congratulate myself due to the fact that, within the framework of Leader+, new means have been committed to help rural territories to develop their potential and put into practice the objectives of local and lasting development.It seems important to me that the experimentation of new forms of natural and cultural heritage valorization, as well as the reinforcement of economic environments to favor employment.It seems appropriate to consider that the exchange of these positive development experiences can also register within the framework of transnational cooperation.It is interesting to underline that all rural territories can be eligible in Leader II.However, although within the framework of this initiative, the possibility of defining zones is open for the Member States, the Commission must ensure a certain concentration of resources and for the prioritization of the projects of the less prosperous areas.Of course, transparency is imposed on the criteria for selecting the projects and local action groups.Likewise, I believe that we will have to ensure that the financial circuits of the states or of the local communities do not generate delays in the payment again, which have been able to take some local action groups to financial bankruptcy within the framework of Leader II.Mr. President, as a deputy from an ultraperifical region I have to point out that this is a very special afternoon in regional policy, and I say it for the debate of two community initiatives such as Urban and Interreg.I want to remember that these initiatives are oriented, the first, Urban, to improve the quality of life of citizens living in the neighborhoods of the different European cities, and interreg to facilitate cohesion and to recognize the diversity and potential of the regions of the European Union, particularly when it comes to including ultraperiferic regions in chapters B and C. we deplore, as well as the speaker, which has been excluded fromCHAPTER IIIA.It seems very successful, in Interreg, the reference to the creation of a European Observatory for cooperation purposes.Thanks to the speakers, particularly Mr. Decourrière, for his regional sensitivity and for the acceptance of our amendments.I hope Mr. Commissioner accepts the proposal we make.Mr. President, regarding the different initiatives that we are analyzing this afternoon, I want to focus strictly on a reflection on one of them, specifically in the Urban program.It is true that we are debating this program today because the European Parliament was determined that this initiative should be maintained.The commission's proposal was to eliminate it, together with other initiatives, but the proposal of the Parliament and the sensitivity of the Commission at the time made the Urban initiative maintain.	es
Thank you very much Mr. Barnier.You have answered the questions in concrete terms and opened the dialogue you have discussed about Europe.Today you gave a very good example of compliance with the speaking time.The pronunciation is closed.Question time (Commission) According to the agenda, the question time follows (B5-0009/2000).We treat the inquiries to the Commission.Part I Inquiry No. 36 of (H-0025/00): concerns: infant mortality in Kosovo according to the youngest figures sent to the United Nations by the World Health Organization, the highest infant number of Europe is recorded in Kosovo;Almost 50 % of premature births die, while due to the war there is a steep increase in the miscarriage and the children who are held, despite everything, are not physically developed so well.Can the Commission - given the humanitarian aid of the European Union and the efforts of the special representative Bernard Kouchner - indicate which measures were taken to protect the right of women on motherhood and the health of pregnant women, weekers and infants in Kosovo?Mr. President, the Commission is the very difficult situation in terms of health and medical facilities in Kosovo, and not only for pregnant women, but in general.This situation is the result of both the latest conflict and years of neglect that preceded him.The figures mentioned in the area of ​​child mortality speak a eloquent language and cannot be accepted.But the situation is hardly better for other parts of the population.The Commission has taken the following measures: First, the healthcare system receives comprehensive support from Echo.The focus is on supplying medical aid and medical assistance, support for health institutions and vaccination measures.However, we are increasingly based on the creation of a self -supporting system of health care in the province.This process is largely supported by Unmik.Second, the first urgent measures were carried out in the Mitrovica hospital as part of the reconstruction program, with funds of one million euros being used from the renovation program.Due to the tense relationships between the ethnic groups in this divided city, the work is slow.Thanks to the support from Unmik, however, the Commission can continue its aid measures as part of this project.We hope that this project will one day develop into a symbol of ethnic reconciliation.Based on the community of damage by the community, the costs for the reconstruction of the health facilities and the equipment of pharmacies and clinics are estimated at EUR 4 million.The Commission is now aiming for program planning for the funds for 2000.We assume that u.a considerable sum for the reconstruction of the healthcare system will be provided.The focus will be on long -term reforms that will have the financing of health care, training and order system on the subject.Together with Unmik, it is currently being examined to what extent the Commission can participate in these measures.Mr. Commissioner!Among other things, Commission President President President President President emphasized this morning that in the Balkans, our ability to act efficiently is put to the test that the credibility of the European Union itself is at stake and that the gap between words and deeds must finally be bridged.Do not think, Mr. Commissioner, that the present information about the high infant and child mortality rate in Kosovo - the highest in all of Europe - as well as the image of human misfortune and the destruction that is offered in Kosovo, already severely impairs our credibility and questions our ability to put promise into practice?	de
"After the failure of the interviews between Spö and Övp, the socialists tried to constitute a minority government, praying the FPö to give his support.There were three ministerial positions - just read the newspapers to know -, assignments offered precisely to that party that is accused of being fascist here!After our sudden renunciation of such an offer, an impaired campaign of instigation and propaganda began that we still cannot understand.The FPö is a party that occupies a well -consolidated role within the political landscape of Austria: one of its representative holds the position of president of one of the nine lands of the Austrian republic, while the party participates in the governments of all the others.Therefore, many Austrians wonder today why their democratic choice is suddenly interpreted as an expression of a fascist mentality and because the instigation campaign began only after the FPö denied its support for a minority government.A climate of prejudice is spreading which, without looking at our program, reduces the most cruel period of European history to a political show.It really takes me that some of our opponents exploit, for the purposes of low alloy propaganda, the millions of people who died in the gas chambers of the concentration camps.For example, the Honorable Bertinotti, who yesterday, on Italian television, accused Haider of denying the Holocaust, did so.Be ashamed, connect!Although he has exhausted all political arguments, he still does not have the right to exploit the memory of the killed for his petty propaganda.The fame of anti -fascist will not be conquered by denouncing a democratically elected colleague as a Nazi!On the contrary, he does nothing but delle the true victims of national Socialism and minimize fascist dictatorships.She acts on the basis of her prejudices, renouncing any political comparison.In doing so, it behaves precisely according to that style that claims to want to fight.Attacks against the new Austrian government, the attempt to exercise political influence in a Member State represent an offense against the Austrian population.We are therefore particularly grateful to the commission for the position it has taken.In the future negotiations within the coalition, the democratic reform, the rights of the opposition, the commitment to compensate the forced workers ... (the president interrupts the speaker) lady president, honorable colleagues will be discussed, I wish to start my intervention by clarifying very well that in Austria there is no danger that they can be reborn neither a political system based on the single party nor a right system.Austria is a stable democracy, in which human rights and fundamental freedoms are guaranteed by the Constitution and protected by an independent judicial system.Austria is an open country, where there is no room for xenophobia and discrimination.What is happening in Austria is nothing more than a normal process of passage of power following democratic elections with which it was said ""no"" to the old system and sought, finding it, a stable parliamentary majority that can implement the necessary economic and social reforms."	it
Now, intergovernmental conferences are like an event and can also be like a Christmas tree.And, therefore, the possibility of these issues, which are recurring and have gone from one conference to another, are not excluded.The problem that arises is if there is consensus at this time, in the field of the European Union, so that this issue is included, taking into account in particular that, if a matter of that class is included, probably other matters of a similar nature increase the agenda of the conference.He has the word, for a matter of order, Mr. Dimitrakopoulos.I beg you to be brief.Mr. President, I understand that I have to do it very fast.I liked what Mr. Seixas Da Costa has said about Santa Claus.In Spain the letter to the Magi is said.I simply want to remind you that the European Parliament has already sent the letter to the Magi with their reports.Now is the Presidency, and the Council, who has to bring the gifts that we have asked in our letter to the Magi.As I suspected, it was not exactly a matter of order, but a debate closure.We thank Mr. Seixas da Costa, but he can also write his letter to the Magi.I would only like to say that this Christmas issue that your honor has raised is of the greatest importance.Now, in this case Santa Claus can only give gifts when they are authorized by others.It will not depend on the Portuguese presidency to give the gifts that everyone wants, in particular those that the European Parliament claims.After this interesting exchange of opinions, and in accordance with the regulation, I inform you that questions 17 to 27 will be answered in writing.The question shift to the Council is closed.Capital tax in accordance with the agenda, the joint debate on: the oral question (B5-0004/2000) of Mr. Désir and others to the Council, on the position of the Council regarding the idea of ​​a capital tax.The oral question (B5-0005/2000) of Mr. Désir and others to the commission, on the position of the commission regarding the idea of ​​a capital tax.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. Commissioner, all have been able to measure, at the time of the 1997 Asian crisis as after the one that hit Mexico in 1995, or the SME in 1993, the damages in the economy of whole countries that can produce financial speculation, especially that exerted on the currencies.From 1,500 to 2,000 billion euros, they are changed daily in financial markets, or in four days, the equivalent of the totality of the annual world production, of the world GDP, which is approximately 6,000 billion euros.That is, in the main, these financial operations are purely speculative without link with merchandise exchanges or investments.But the erratic displacement of those considerable masses of capital can cause in a few hours the sinking of a currency, the economy of a country, and sink the entire population into the recession.	es
"Isn't it time that the Turkish government cancel the economic blockade against Armenia?President!I would like to thank the representative of the council presidency for his answer.However, I am a little sad that you can see this bilaterally at first, but ultimately there is a large triangular ratio.We give partnerships and have cooperation agreements to help Armenia, and yet the help cannot be effective because Turkey carries out an economic blockade, so that many things for the Armenians cannot go on at all.Turkey is negotiating because of the possible accession, and it is in our interest that every state who wants to become a member also maintains friendly relationships at its border with its neighbors.Can't you influence Turkey more to enable peaceful development to enable the Armenians to develop that is necessary for the progress of the cooperation?Ms. MPs, you are right if you say that we have to use the relationship with Turkey that the country mentioned can play a constructive role in this situation and, above all, are part of the solution and no longer part of the problem.Precisely because Turkey has taken a new path in its relationships with the European Union and because Turkey is now also confronted with the need to have to give an answer to the positions of the European Union in the field of common foreign and security policy, we - this do not need to be concealed - will examine the intentions of Turkey with regard to the priorities of the European Union in its external relationships.Of course, relationships with Armenia also have one of these external relationships by the agreement concluded last year.We think that Turkey, if it wants to share the basic values ​​of the European Union and the general framework of the relationships of the European Union - and regardless of the special bilateral conditions that it can have with other country - generally behave according to the basic norms that the European Union uses in its external relationships.We also assume that this question will form one of the focus in the bilateral relationships between the European Union and Turkey in the near future.Since they concern similar topics, inquiries No. 5 and 6 are answered together.Inquiry No. 5 of (H-0031/00): concerns: tightening the situation in Kosovo The genocide of the Serbs and other ethnic groups in Kosovo, apart from the Albanian, continues and accepts even greater proportions.Even Mr. Kouchner recently explained that the political situation and the security situation in Kosovo were anything but good.In addition, it is pointed out that the UN resolution 1244 is not used and that in particular is violated against its provisions that contain guarantees for all residents of Kosovo.Rather, the extreme, separatist forces are encouraged, which culminates in the fact that the former Uck guide, H. Thaqi, appointed Kosovo as ""preliminary prime minister"" and the Uck was declared ""protection force for Kosovo"".What does the Council intend to do in view of this situation so that the UN resolutions and in particular the resolution 1244 are used and a separation of the province of Kosovo from Serbia is prevented?"	de
I myself have mentioned different possible responses to this challenge, which consists for all of us to recall, to demonstrate again what we have been doing together since 1957: economic community of course, but first community of values ​​and charter of fundamental rights which will protect more clearly and more clearly citizens;Article 13 of the Treaty, relating to discrimination, of which we proposed, in our opinion of January 26, even before the Austrian crisis, that it was governed, after the CIG, by the qualified majority and no longer by unanimity;The possible hypothesis, I say possible - I say it personally - to complete article 7 by a new paragraph which would endow the procedure for monitoring or democratic alert with a legal basis and then, finally, public debate.The only way to back up bad ideas is to express others.I thus come back to our discussion, at the moment, I deeply believe in the value and the democratic force of the debate, in particular to fight demagoguery.Mr. Commissioner Barnier, you have strongly insisted, in your declaration, on the importance of dialogue with the citizens of Europe.As for the CIG, you know that under Helsinki's decisions, the Portuguese presidency was granted the specific right to expand the agenda of the CIG in the course of this conference.It is clear that parliament will have its own representatives, MM.Brok and tsatsos.However, the Commissioner, would you also be able to make the commitment, if the agenda is extended by the Council, to refer to the Parliament so that we can debate it in our bosom but also with you, and this in order to continue this dialogue with the citizens on which you insisted so much?.Mr. Beazley, my answer is clearly yes, but it is not frankly new.President Napolitano and many members of the Constitutional Affairs Committee, and even more deputies, here, in plenary session, know that I will be available to say, on behalf of the Commission, throughout this negotiation, in a spirit of transparency and in real time, how things are going.I may say it differently from Professor Tsatsos and Elmar Brok, who are your direct representatives.It is also likely that, in many circumstances, we will say it together.I believe very important that this negotiation is not clandestine, neither with regard to the European Parliament nor with regard to national parliaments, which I remind you that in the end, they will have their opinion to give and their positions to be taken in the process of ratification.This is why I paid tribute to the initiative of Mr. Napolitano of joint, regular consultation, between national parliaments of the fifteen countries and the European Parliament.That said, the duty of transparency and debate begins here, about the reform of institutions.So, I will be available whenever you want to realize our positions and the progress of this negotiation throughout the starting year.Mr. President, I first compliment the Commission for his approach.I think it is really very good to start dialogue with the citizen as soon as possible because, to tell the truth, it did not take place in the wake of the Amsterdam Treaty and the Maastricht Treaty and it only led to great distrust.	fr
"This goal of minimizing the contradictions is a fair and reasonable goal to which the decision is geared.In my opinion, the idea of ​​setting up an observation center for the development of this coherence between the community policies and cooperation and development policy is quite obvious and relevant.Your field of action must not be limited to the community policies, but must also include the measures or policies of the Member States, including the measures of economic groups, which I consider important.This observation center should develop a report on the development and effects of these policies and their connection annually.For the conclusion, I canceled a question that, in my view, is of fundamental importance and must be checked and confirmed by this parliament.Our goal of reducing the contradictions between cooperation and development policy and the other policies to a minimum measure must not only be valid within the European Union, but because of the increasing globalization of the economy.If we want to achieve fair world trade, we have to enforce the same principle in the next multilateral round of negotiations at the World Trade Organization because it would be a contradiction if the European Union imposed an iron, although fair discipline, only so that the United States and other great powers then do the opposite and exploit what we do not do.It is therefore correct and necessary that these principles are determined at the next round of the world trade organization.Mr. President, the general director of the general directorate responsible for development, said a report on the coherence of the various Union politics with development policy before the document due in the spring was presented with developmental policy, would mean that the horse was foamed from behind.It is irrelevant that the claim to the Commission, which was clearly defined in the decision of the Council, was only met with a ""non-paper"".The real problem is that at a time when poverty increases worldwide, this horse climbs the mountain and the cart on which the other EU policies are unloaded is so heavy that development policy slowly slips backwards.Development policy is constantly forgotten or considered an appendix if the most important political decisions of the European Union are made.For example, take the new chocolate directive, which shows that the EU countries spend more for chocolate every year than for development aid.A proper assessment of the development policy effects of this guideline did not take place, which according to the producer of the 90 % of our AKP partners could lead to income losses for the cocoa producers of at least 15 %.Let us take the fishing agreements that show how little the current fishing practice is in the EU waters.At the same time, we negotiate joint ventures, which are intended to give the large European fishing vehicles an extended access to the waters of developing countries, and which will lose their work in these countries worldwide.Let's take the trade agreement.As Mr. Nielson said this morning with regard to the Lomé Agreement, the preference regulation only applies to ""essentially all products of the least developed countries"".In other words, poverty fighting becomes meaningless as soon as it comes to the commercial interests of the EU."	de
In this perspective, the strategy of separating the objective of preventing the deterioration of the state of surface and underground waters from the objectives of protecting, improving the quality of the same should not be pursued, constituting a superfluous priority scale at the expense of an organicity of interventions and specific measures aimed in the combined approach and in the use of the best available techniques.As regards the elimination of pollution produced by dangerous substances in the aquatic environment, the optimization of the approach should provide for regulation, both nationally and community level, to allow a better identification of the different types of polluted water bodies as a consequence of human production activities.Finally, it is necessary to constitute a system that prepares a list of potentially dangerous substances, through the greatest number of information about the chemical, physical and biological properties, in order to create an integrated model of intervention at different strategic levels, with the safeguarding of the good water, which is fundamental for all of us.Mr. President, the goal of the directive must be to ensure that the Member States ensure a combined protection of surface and underground waters and drinking water, and that the level of protection is compatible with the community legislation in force in environmental matters.I am allowed to remember that the decisions already approved about the nitrate directive have not yet been applied to various Member States, despite being a decision of the Union.The proposal in question contains a series of more severe provisions regarding the protection of the aquatic environment that go beyond the environmental objectives currently in force.The directive proposes that for the marine environment the final objective of concentrations close to the value of environmental concentrations for existing substances in nature and close to zero for synthetic substances attributable to human activity must be achieved.This is impossible, not only, but it is also against nature.The approval of this report will have serious consequences on European agriculture, to the extent that the concentrations for example of phosphorus and nitrogen cannot exceed the value of the environmental concentration of these substances in the aquatic environment and to the extent that you want to fix a zero limit value for pesticides in the aquatic environment.Thus European agriculture cannot devote themselves to the cultivation of bakery cereals with a protein tenor sufficiently high to allow the use of these cereals for bakery.The result will be that agricultural production will move to other countries outside the union, with all the socio -economic and employment consequences that this entails.I will not be able to vote in favor of the provisions of the Framework Directive on the waters that deal with the aspects stated.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, water is a precious resource.Millions of people do not even have clean water, an essential prerequisite for survival.It is therefore no wonder that water is the basic motif of some wars.The capitalist world also places its pawns in order to exercise maximum control over water reserves.Rarely proves to be solidarity or think of the general interest.Europe therefore has a difficult task in front of it: integrating community policy on water, fragmented both in terms of objectives and means, giving life to a more cohesive framework legislation.	it
The importance of the safety of road transport, railway and in internal navigable routes is undoubted and given the international character of this type of transport, also training courses for safety consultants must be harmonized, such as, for example, for the next new ADR.All this is important, but equally essential is the implementation of current regulations.There are several reasons to pay attention to this aspect, just look at how many accidents have produced in recent years in the event of fog in Belgium, or in Holland or in other countries.There are many accidents in which trucks that transported dangerous goods were involved and that in these weather conditions should not have been traveling instead of being quietly on the roads.Or we think of ships from Eastern Europe countries that surf into clearly dangerous conditions.From investigations conducted in Belgian, Finnish and Japanese ports, it has also emerged that 50 percent of containers containing dangerous goods are not delivered in compliance with current regulations.In short, the importance of the theme is enormous.As regards the situation of security consultants, in some Member States starting from 1 January of this year, companies must have obligatory internal.Currently the problems created by this rule are many, especially for smaller companies, which do not have sufficient financial means.Consequently, these companies are forced to give up their load or mix it with another load, with the serious problems that this generates.For this reason, companies are asked to integrate these activities in financial reports, or in company analyzes, to be inserted in ISO 9002 certifications. The regulatory framework is ready, now we must deal with its implementation.Allow me to indicate a last point, always concerning the application of the rules.Satisfactory agreements with the countries of Eastern Europe must be made, given that they will join the treaties on the subject only from 1 July 2001, that is, only between a year and a half.These countries now enjoy a slight competitive advantage, which is not serious.However, I believe that aspects that concern the safety of road transport, railway and navigable streets, and promptly present this part of the Community acquision to the countries candidate for adhesion should be priority.Mrs. President, in this parliament, rightly, the importance of transport safety is regularly in full.The ever -growing volumes of goods that cross Europe involve, consciously or not, risks of all genres for staff, the environment and society.Therefore, those who have to manage the aforementioned risks must meet very rigorous requirements.The rules sanctioned in another directive, Directive 95/35/EC, seem adequate enough to provide responsible advice on the organization of transport of dangerous goods.I rejoice that I have reached an agreement with the Council regarding the minimum requirements for the exams of security consultants, although I would have preferred that uniform rules and programs had been formulated to guarantee the equality of diplomas internationally.	it
In addition, honorable parliamentarians, I would like to focus a moment on the role and structure of the directors, before moving on to the main observations and criticisms formulated by the rapporteur or by the honorable parliamentarians.With regard to the role and structure of the guidelines, the president of the competent commission, honorable Hatzidakis, the rapporteur and the honorable McCarthy have recalled that they are intended to assist national and regional authorities in the preparation of the programming strategy for the objectives nos.1, 2, 3 of the structural funds and the respective connections with the cohesion fund.The commission's priorities are presented on the basis of the experiences collected in the implementation phase of the programs as well as the current community policies connected to structural interventions.The objective is to ensure that these priorities contribute to better use, to optimal and effective use of community interventions, as many of you have hoped, also by resorting to the appropriate time, honorable Bradbourn, to the performance reserve properly intended to promote optimal and effective use of European public money.When I speak of optimal use, I mean both nationally and regional level, and therefore, honorable Seppänen, speaking of the national level, I also refer to the link with the cohesion fund.This regarding the objective of the lines.In relation to the content, on the other hand, as is known to the honorable parliamentarians, the guidelines are articulated around three strategic priorities that the rapporteur has recalled with great clarity and also with great passion, as I have had the opportunity to verify in her intervention.The first priority consists in improving the competitiveness of regional economies to create, in all sectors, but in particular in the private individual, as Mr Berend said, the maximum serious, solid and lasting jobs.Competitiveness of regional economies, of all regional economies, therefore, and in particular of Wales, Mr Evans, but not only of Wales.I add again, since many of you have considered that they were an omission, the regional economies of the European regions disadvantaged for their geographical distance, whether it is peripheral regions, insular or of course of ultra -aperiferous regions, which are then the most distant.In this regard, I could perhaps respond to the honorable Ribeiro I Castro who asked me, just as I wrote to the presidents of the ultra -aperiferous regions, that the Commission asked for a few weeks of extension for the publication of his report .. We received the memoranda of the governments of the ultra -aperiferous regions with a lot of delay, but this certainly does not want to be an alibi, if anything an explanation.An extremely serious job must be done on these memoranda.I personally participated in a meeting of the ultra -aperiferous regions on November 23 and the college considered that a few extra weeks was needed to draw up a report to the height of the extremely serious and serious problems and the expectations of these overperitical regions and thank you for your understanding.Here is the first priority, that is, the competitiveness of regional economies.The second priority, on which many of you have insisted, in particular the honorable Puerta and still others far from me the wanting to establish a hierarchical order between them is the strengthening of social cohesion and employment, mainly enhancing human resources, better than in the past.	it
Mr. President, this debate was very useful.One or two speakers have referred to specific questions on which we were strongly advised to think carefully.For example, Mrs. Maij-Weggen spoke about both Indonesia and Burma and made some important comments on these countries and on the human rights situation there.I would like to focus very briefly on one or two subjects that were regularly raised during the debate.One of the very first speakers, Mr. Wuori, spoke of the remarks that Mr. Havel made today.This speech was remarkable and I hope that Mr. Gollnisch, who is no longer able to be with us, could also hear it.I also hope, if there is a life in space, as Mr. Newton Dunn supposedly, that she too could hear the speech of Mr. Havel.The latter reminded us that our Union does not only concern markets, the growth of the PNB, that it is a union of values ​​which is reflected in the treaties and in our obligations at the level of external aid as a whole, which is reflected quite specifically in what we are responsible for doing.How do we work what the treaties that are talking about development aid programs say?One or two honorable parliamentarians, MM.Feber and Cushnahan spoke of the ditch that separates the rhetoric from reality.Mr. Cashman said, and he is right in a sense, that words do not replace real action.Of course, words can make a little difference, as Ms. Malmström pointed out.She said she received a letter from the Chinese ambassador, a very kind and very intelligent representative and servant of her country, to tell her that she was wrong and that the European Parliament adopted a bad attitude towards human rights in China.I think that after her speech, she will receive a mountain of letters from the Chinese authorities.She will be able to fill a cabinets with binders with letters concerning what is said to be the real situation in China.I think she reflected the views of many non -governmental organizations, many people who admire Chinese civilization but who are concerned about what is happening in China today.Obviously, it is quite true that we must consider an action and the very first speech, run by Mr. Salafranca, mentioned two distinct subjects of Geneva and which concerned actions.One of them is of course made possible thanks to the generosity of the European Parliament on behalf of European taxpayers - namely the budget that we are able to spend on human rights activities - around 100 million euros which are spent through programs, of which I am responsible, and which go mainly to non -governmental organizations in order to promote human rights and democratization.We will have to share with Parliament, as the vicars say, our points of view on the best way to focus and target this expenditure program aimed at supporting human rights in the years to come.	fr
"This is the level of sophistication and provisions I would like.All I can do for the moment is promise that I will try to get there.Let me first wish a good Saint-David to the Commissioner.Thank you for this presentation.It is important that the Commission never loses sight of the fact that the reform process will be a real waste of time unless contact is restored with European citizens.This is what we must focus fully at every moment.It must offer them a service and the recommendations aimed at reducing payment deadlines will certainly be certain, well welcomed, but the other complaint that the citizens we represent regularly for us regularly relates to the paperwork, an excessive paperwork.Is there a reference to a reduction in paperwork and bureaucracy for candidates for European financing with the guarantee of financial control?This is a precise complaint that reaches us.We must answer them.The other question I would like to ask the audit monitoring committee.This committee is, of course, welcome but I think it is essential that it understands a reference to the control of the recommendations of the European Parliament in our discharge procedure.Will you add that to the work of your audit monitoring committee?Finally, the group of socialists agrees with the establishment of the budget on the basis of activities and with empowerment, and you will be judged, as Mr. Prodi says, on the basis of your actions and not your words.The task of restoring contact between the Commission and European citizens is critical, as Morgan said.It can only be performed by acts and not words.I say it with a certain deference within the European Parliament because it has many speech experts, but we will try to give an example.Regarding excessive paperwork, Ms. Morgan explained the dilemma.We hate excess paperwork, but given the requirements of control, additional control and retrification aimed at ensuring effective financial control, sometimes the requirements of the administration, that some name ""bureaucracy"", are inevitable.However, with a view to reducing these obligations as much as possible, we are not just talking about it;We will appoint, in the fairly close future, an assistant secretary general, an additional assistant secretary general who will have the mandate and as a specific task of identifying best practices and disseminating them within the Commission;He will also have to guarantee a radical reduction in procedures, a cause of so much paperwork, so much bureaucracy and, I would also say, so much frustration, not only at the level of the citizens and the companies of the Union, but also of all the people who work for the Commission.Admittedly, we will endeavor to achieve it and I think that the effects will begin to be felt in the coming years.One of our difficulties will always be, of course, that the more effective we will be in terms of reform, the less people will know.So, we will count on our friends and our European Parliament partners to explain, with their usual generosity, all the efforts that the Commission undertakes in order to serve the citizens of Europe correctly."	fr
They live in areas that should benefit from these projects.If we get it from the perspective of this triple orientation, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens will believe more in Europe, and this seems very important because, in the end, the cities will be increasingly the protagonists of European life..(Fr) Mr. President, before my colleagues and friends, Mr. Franz Fischler and Mrs. Anna Diamantopoulou, intervene in turn -given that the three, that we are in charge of these four community initiatives, we have been lucky enough to follow this debate with the same attention -, I would like to insist on the evocation of Urban and Interreg, which many of you have remembered and on which you have intervened.I want to express my gratitude to the speakers of the commissions, of all of them, and also to the speakers of the groups and each and every one of you for the great quality, the great interest that their interventions reveal in relation to these two initiatives.In particular, it is very true what Mrs. Arlene McCarthy said about Urban.I would like to thank not only the work and the report that you have presented, if not, why I do not say it too, everything we owe, what you owe to you in relation to this initiative, that we also owe it, more generally, to your Parliament.Indeed, it does not forget that it has been the European Parliament that has decided and politically desired to maintain this initiative in favor of the regeneration of urban areas in crisis, in favor of a lasting urban development, generating this integrated approach at the same time, which we so much appreciate, to jointly treat economic, social and environmental aspects.Other points of agreement underlined by the report of Mrs. Arlene McCarthy are: the effectiveness of this instrument through financial concentration and a critical mass for interventions;The horizontal mechanism -which is, in our opinion, more favorable for the dissemination of results and for the multiplication of exchanges of effective experiences and practices;and, finally, the growing role of local authorities in the conception and in the management of the programs, based on a true partareria.Once remembered the fundamental points of agreement between the proposals of the Commission and its Parliament, and once my great interest in listening to the different interventions, I would like to respond to some criticisms, to some suggestions that have been made, apologizing in advance for not being able to personally cite each of those who have intervened.I believe that each one can recognize in my speech.First the Urban program, and the maximum ceiling of fifty cities, which some of you have described as arbitrary.I understand this concern.Therefore, I have requested my services that are willing to consider a reasonable increase in the number of cities that will be eligible in the Urban program, through certain guarantees, relative in the first place to the concentration - specific in particular in intervention areas, which must have a minimum of 20,000 inhabitants and, exceptionally, 10,000-, and secondly, to the critical financial mass: we should keep the figure of 500 euros per inhabitantof the European Union is both effective and readable, and so that it does not seem like a kind of superficial makeup that would not offer any read to citizens or the municipalities.	es
It is very useful and I consider it an excellent contribution from the honorable Swoboda and its colleagues.We are very grateful for the way he has been able to conduct the works on this question and for the contribution of some of his colleagues, some of whom are present in the classroom tonight - the honorable packs, Lagendijk and others.I am pleased to the fact that overall our relations with the erim are so good, and perhaps the honorable Dupuis, and his interpreter, will forgive me if I use this expression in a spirit of friendly entente.The excellent representative of the European Union in the country contributed to this result, who is a great friend of Parliament and a great servant of the Commission.The imminent start of the negotiations on the stabilization and association agreement is the most significant example of our good relationships.The same can be said of the ERIM cooperation in Kosovo's reconstruction.I am grateful to the authorities of Macedonia for the assistance they have provided in recent weeks, helping to cope with the considerable difficulties encountered as regards the provision of electricity in Kosovo.Like the honorable deputies, I recognize the stabilizing role played by this country during the tragedy of the Balkans, with particular reference to the integration of the Albanian minority in the political and social life of the country.I saw the newly elected president Georgievski a few weeks ago and I was extremely affected, like others, by his commitment to multi -ethnicity and pluralism.If I am allowed I would like to illustrate how things are about the negotiations to whom - as Mr Lagendijk - other countries in the region have said with enormous interest.On January 24 of this year, the Council adopted the negotiation directives for an agreement of stabilization and association with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, which represents the most important step forward in the process of stabilization and association of the Western Balkans started by the Commission in May 1999. Allow me to clarify the main elements of these projects of directive, which provide for the inclusion in the agreement of provisions to establish a political dialogue with the ERIM,Provisions for better regional cooperation, including the prospect of creating free trade areas between the countries of the region, even if I have to clarify that any attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia is out of the question.They also concern the prospect of creating a free trade zone between the European Union and the countries of the Region within ten years from the entry into force of the agreement, provisions on the free movement of workers, the right of establishment, the provision of services, payments and capital movements, a commitment from the erim to close its legislation to that of the European Union, in particular in key sectors of the internal market, and provisions on the cooperation with the ERIM in an ERIMvarieties of fields, including justice and internal affairs.The Commission is now doing all the preparations necessary to ensure that negotiations can start in March.I will visit the eim in the second week of March.On that occasion I hope to be able to start the process, even if the formal negotiations will begin immediately after.	it
"What is the position of the Commission in the face of these considerations?Iugoslavia is also a weak stability ring and therefore represents a threat to the stability of Macedonia.We have to wait for further developments in the situation.The climate in Belgrade becomes more uncertain every day.However, we support the Council's decision to modify the tone of sanctions.With this decision, at least a serious attempt to support the opposition that is being prepared for a new series of demonstrations is fulfilled.What does the European Union intend to do in this regard, in the event that the request for the opposition of early elections is accepted?What can we still do to support the opposition?Mr. President, Kosovo has hoped to hopefully the last case in which international law has been interpreted as the right of a dictatorial management to persecute minorities in the most chilling way, with the argument ""are internal issues"".When the United States and NATO, and finally also the European Union, decided to act was now too late.For example, if the union had acted before and in a clearer way, many suffering would have been avoided.The European Union has therefore now has a particular responsibility in terms of aid, assistance and reconstruction in the Balkans.Our ultimate goal must remain the creation of the conditions that will allow all south -crack countries to integrate with the rest of the union, on the economic, commercial and political level.Commerce and economic integration represent the best way to create fertile ground for democracy in a corner of Europe so devastated by the war.We liberals are willing to do a lot and do it soon, just as illustrated by Paolo Costa.We therefore greet with the maximum satisfaction the proposal of a stabilization and association agreement with Macedonia, and we thank the honorable Swoboda for the excellent relationship.Macedonia deserves our help, also in recognition of the sacrifices and work carried out generously by the population of Macedonia and its rulers during the war in Kosovo.Now that Macedonia frees itself from the destructive grip of communism and nationalism, we are clearly required to act and lend our assistance.Just as we will have to do for other Balkan states.A duty task for the union.Mr. President, in this context I would like to remind the deputies - not least in the light of a discussion already held during the evening - that the man on which the main responsibility of the war, the humiliation of human beings, massacres, and expulsion from their homes of innocent people still governs the rest of Yugoslavia, Serbia.The man who is accused of genocide and who should be judged by the court for war crimes is still on the loose.I'm talking about Milosevic.Until Milosevic remains in command and Serbia does not take the path of democracy, Serbia will represent a constant threat to peace in the entire Balkan area and also for Macedonia.Mr. President, the agreement in question will constitute the first step towards the application of the stability pact in sweating Europe."	it
We must take into account the advice of fishermen.We must take into account the concerns of fishermen and we must work closely with them.I hope that you will take into account, as a commissioner responsible for fishing that you will become aware of this ditch and that you will try to work as closely as possible for all parties to be united and for their opinions to be taken into account.Thank you, Mr. Commissioner Fischler.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11 a.m.Insolvency procedures The agenda calls for the report (A5-0039/2000) of Mr. Lechner, in the name of the legal commission and the internal market, on the proposal for the settlement of the council relating to the insolvency procedures (9178/1999 - C5-0069/1999 - 1999/0806 (CNS)).Mr. President, I believe that we are all agreement for the creation of a European judicial space.We also agree that there is harmonization in an area marked by an extreme disparity in our legal systems, and even more concepts.The very word of insolvency, the legal concept of insolvency, does not cover the same accounting notion in each of the Member States of the Union.So we agree on the observation, and the draft settlement and the report go in the right direction.If I may afford, I will make some observations, however, on the method.When we take note - and we could not do otherwise - of the disparity of legal systems and concepts, and that we want to go in the direction of better coordination, I believe that there are three ways to proceed.The first is to make equivalences saying: ultimately, insolvency in France is the same as insolvency in England or in Germany.The second way of proceeding is to recreate an ex nihilo law, that is to say to harmonize systems, to completely redesign all concepts and legal systems in each of the states.It is not the way that has been taken.The third way that was taken is finally to superimpose, above existing systems, which we do not touch, a real embryo of Community law of collective procedures and the company in difficulty.It is a good thing, and the result has probably exceeded the ambition of the authors.But at this stage I would like to make an observation, which is not technical, but more philosophical and inspired by practice.It is that insolvency is experienced in the European Union, in most states, as an absolutely definitive event for the one who lives it.And I think that it is our responsibility, in an economy that goes faster and faster, where everyone must have their chance and have it really, to give the chance to try a commercial enterprise, and a second, a third chance if it is necessary.	fr
At the request of a French deputy, Mr. Zimeray, a petition has already been introduced;She has collected many signatures including mine.However, I ask you, in accordance with the orientation now constantly expressed by the European Parliament and the entire European Community, to intervene with the President and the Governor of Texas, Mr. Bush, by playing the prestige of your mandate and the institution that you represent, because it is Mr. Bush who has the power to suspend the death sentence and to pardon the condemned.And all this while respecting the principles that we have always supported.Thank you, Mr. Segni, I will gladly do it.It is indeed completely in the position line that our parliament has always adopted.Madam President, I would like to draw your attention to a case that parliament has regularly taken care of.This is the case of Alexandre Nikitin.We all rejoice, in this enclosure, that the court pronounced its release and clearly established that in Russia too, access to environmental information was a constitutional right.However, it makes itself that it seems to be indictment again, the public prosecutor having appealed.We know, and we have also established it in many resolutions - including during the last period of last year - that this case is not only of a legal nature and that it is wrong to accuse Alexandre Nikitin of criminal activity and betrayal because we are concerned by his results and we take advantage of it.These results form the basis of European Barent Sea Protection programs and that is why I beg you to examine a letter project depicting the essential facts of this case and to communicate to Russia the position which stems from the decisions of the Parliament.Yes, Madame Schroedter, I will gladly examine the facts relating to this question when I have received your letter.Madam President, I would first like to congratulate you for having kept his word because indeed, in this first period of session, in this new year, the number of television channels has really been increased significantly in our premises.However, the president, what I asked for was not achieved.There are two Finnish channels and a Portuguese chain, but there is still no Dutch chain.Yet I asked you for a Dutch chain, because the Dutch people also wish to be able to follow the news each month when sent to this land of exile.I therefore ask you to do what is necessary so that we can have a Dutch chain.Mrs. Plooij-Van Gorsel, I can tell you that this question is on the agenda of the meeting of the quaestors on Wednesday.She will be, I hope, examined in a positive spirit.Madam President, how is it that Parliament does not comply with the regulations on health and security that it votes?How is it that no air quality test has been carried out in this building since our election?	fr
Regarding this, the most delicate problem is raised: how is a European prosecutor placed within relations with different national communities and justice, as structured?I consider that this issue must still be addressed both from the cultural point of view and from the practical point of view.Today we run the risk of superimposing a new institution to the multiple and diverse institutions that already exist in each of the states.Mr. President, I am going to refer very briefly to two issues.In the first place, I would not want to pronounce myself on the philosophical aspects of the subsidiarity and sovereignty of the Member States, although I am very supportive that they are discussed, because in my usual spectator of the British televisions I am aware of the complaints of the national politicians of that country for what they consider as a threat of the continent against their national legal culture.Sometimes they touch the theatrical and I think it deserves a debate.However, this is not the issue I want to refer to.The issue that interests me is the report of Mrs. Theato.I believe that, given the legal difficulties that this issue raises - and it is evident that the European Union only has a very narrow route to ensure that such crimes are prosecuted as European crimes - the legal course has been lost.I refer to recommendations 1 and 2. In them there is no longer talk of a European prosecutor but, for legal reasons, he has now become an independent European authority, an agency has previously called Mrs. Theato.In this aspect, it is obvious that we have difficulties with the legal basis.We also have difficulties in terms of crimes.This point has not modified.It still includes crimes that in some ways exceed, or at least they can exceed, the framework of European crimes, such as money laundering and reception, and the illegal association.In this context, in my opinion, some legally confusing points remain, which should be clarified.Even so, it is essential - and for this we are going to vote in favor of point 1 excluding this recommendation - is that the Parliament transmits to the commission and the Council a clear sign of our will to end, through a clear normative act, to the situations that have ended up rooting.Mr. President, Parliament has claimed, for years, a specific and uniform criminal protection of the financial interests of the Union.The truth is that frustration increases when the fragility of the agreement is verified (and the protocols related to such protection), which, five years after its signature, has not yet been ratified or entered into force.On the other hand, more voluntary attempts, such as the current OLAF, do not exceed legitimate concerns about the individual rights guarantees system.The proposals of the report of Mrs. Theato aimed at urging the commission to present a material normative act on the criminal protection of financial interests with the typification of crimes, in particular fraud to the community budget, are, in our opinion, a serious attempt to institute a new and increasingly necessary community uniform community.	es
"Thank you very much, honor.Let me congratulate you for what in German parliamentarism is designated - uninjustifiably in your case - as the ""premiere speech"" (Jungpherredred).Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I intervene on behalf of my colleague Robert Goebbels, who must have been absent to attend to a political commitment.Within the Economic and Monetary Commission, the Jonckheer report has raised rough controversies around the operation of the market.A little right of the right has managed to eliminate any reference to market insufficiencies.Although our Parliament mostly pursued this ultraliberal concept of a supposedly perfect market, the world would not change for it.Economic relations in the real world mainly demonstrate that the elimination of any public intervention in the market does not produce perfect competition or an optimal distribution of resources.Although the market has been since the night of time the place of privileged exchange of humans, it has never been perfect.The market gives priority to the short term and immediate benefits.In the market, the relations of force between supply and demand are, generally, at a disadvantage of the weakest, consumers and workers.The market needs standards to work.The necessary and precious spirit of initiative must have as a corollary the meaning of responsibilities before society.We, European socialists, are in favor of a market economy for social purposes.The market is not an end in itself;It must be at the service of the improvement of the human condition.The European Union, the states should not replace economic agents, but that public authorities must define the norms and objectives that allow sustainable development of the economy.Finally, the aid allow restructuring, offer training, save jobs and, ultimately, act with good tino.The union competence policy cannot have as its main objective a reduction in the global level of aid.It is necessary to guide these grants towards the objectives of the Union, in particular, economic and social cohesion, sustainable development and research.The commission must pursue illegal aid and those that really put a clipper to the internal market.Deleting all public aid would be a serious mistake.Internet is not a market of the market, but the result of the investigation financed by the US army.The World Wide Web, which has made possible the brilliant development of the information society, was the work of the CERN de Geneva financed, once again, with public aid.The rescue of the Holzmann Group by the German government has been criticized as an unjustifiable clipper to the market economy.The Duisenberg President has even tried to attribute the weakness, which on the other hand has been relative, of the euro against the dollar, to this state intervention.I have not heard Mr. Duisenberg criticize the rescue of the Hedge Fund LTCM by the American monetary authorities.Wanting to save 60,000 jobs is, apparently, a sin against the market, but the rescue of capital does not seem to raise any problem to the defenders of the free market."	es
I therefore ask you, the president, to ask the commission to express themselves now and that we then proceed to the vote.(Applause of the PSE group) Madam President, above all, I would like it to be clear that the Commission has the greatest respect for the decisions of this Parliament and, in particular, for that which concerns the fixing of the agenda.Therefore, we respect the decisions that Parliament could make in this direction.But I would also like it to be clear that the Prodi President has committed to the Parliament to establish a new debate, as recalled by Mr. Barón, which is added to the annual debate on the legislative program of the Commission, on the main lines of action for the next period of five years, that is to say for this legislature.I would like to say, Madam President, that, in the agreement to which we reached September, this debate differs from the annual presentation of the Commission's legislative program.I would add, Madam President, that, on the side of the Commission, we are ready and willing to organize this debate when that suits you, that we were ready to develop it this week, as had been decided at the start, based on the fact that he was presented the day before in a speech to parliamentary groups.I would therefore like to repeat, Madam President, that, for our part, we have discussed the action program for the next five years and that we are ready to come and present the program for the next five years when Parliament will decide, including this week, if this is its decision and the program for the year 2000, next month, which we had perfectly agreed.I propose that we voted on the request of the socialist group aimed at re -registering the declaration of the Commission on its strategic objectives.(Parliament rejects the request) The president.Always about Wednesday day, I have another proposal concerning the oral question on capital tax.The PPEDE group requests to withdraw this point from the agenda.Is there a colleague to speak on behalf of the group and justify this request?Madam President, to respond to the laughter that I hear among the socialists, I was told that large sides of the socialist group would also like to suppress this point of the agenda because during the ballot within the Conference of Presidents, colleagues responsible for the Socialist Group did not have the vote of the working group.I do not know if this information is correct but in any case, the PPE-DE group would be grateful to delete this point of the agenda because the parliament has indeed been seized of this question.Decisions exist that oppose such a tax.This is why my group asks that this point be removed from the agenda.Thank you, Mr. Poettering.We now hear Mr. Wurtz, who is expressed against this request.Madam President, I would first like to underline the lack of logic of Mr. Poettering.	fr
I have received 7 proposals for resolution, in accordance with section 2 of article 37 of the Regulation, to close this declaration.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Thursday.Cyprus and Malta In accordance with the agenda, the joint debate on: The Declaration of the Council regarding the position of the European Union on the evolution of the Chipriota issue is proceeded;The report (A4-0029/2000) of Mr. Brok, on behalf of the Foreign, Human Rights and Common Security and Defense Commission on the proposal for the Regulation of the Council regarding the application of measures within the framework of the preadite strategy for Cyprus and Malta [com (1999) 0535 - C5-0308/1999 - 1999/0199 (CNS)].On behalf of the Council, Mr. Seixas da Costa has the floor.Mr. President, Ladies, on behalf of the Presidency of the European Union Council, I would like to give some information about the resumption of intrachipriots negotiations and the recent evolution of that issue.I consider that what happened in Helsinki at the end of last year and the new environment that is lived in the framework, in particular, of the relationship between the European Union and Turkey reflects - it is clear for all - a backdrop in the community level that cannot cease to be sensitive to also the relationship of relationship between the two communities, in the field of chipre.I would like to underline that at the beginning of December last year, the first round of negotiations was held in New York - since several years ago interrupted - among the Cypriots communities of the north and southern the island.They were indirect conversations, mediated by the United Nations special representative, Álvaro de Souto.In January of this year - from January 31 - another round was held and it is planned that on May 23 a third round will begin in New York and there is the possibility, not yet confirmed at all, that these conversations are direct and continuous, so that their work would last until September of this year.The substantial aspects in that debate are essentially four: security, government structure, territorial adjustments and refugees and compensation resulting from the situation created after the island's division.However, the possibility of including other issues had been agreed, so the representative of the northern part of the island, Rauf Denktash, proposed three new themes: sovereignty, the creative measures of trust and the lifting of the embargo on the products of the north of the island.From the conversations so far held, two results have been essentially obtained: the possibility of structuring a direct channel of information between the European Union and the northern part of the island has been made -without necessarily meaning its recognition as an entity with legal personality at the international level -in order to facilitate the approval of a community collection for a possible adhesion of the entire island, in the case that in the case of a resolution of the global problem.The division of the island.The second result that seems important to us is the declaration made by the United Nations Secretary General at the end of the first day of conversations, stating that, if a global agreement was achieved for the situation, it would entail recognition of the specificities of the north of the island.	es
This is the only means that can allow Cambogians to forgive those who have only been followers and who can ensure lasting peace.Mr President, this week it was known that the closure of two important Cambodian newspapers of the opposition was threatened because they would have offended the king and the prime minister.These are newspapers that actively support the exponent of the opposition Sam Rengie, against which a procedure is underway to deprive him of parliamentary immunity in order to be able to process it for betrayal.In fact, during the speech held on the occasion of the beginning of the millennium, Sam Rengie dared to say that it is necessary to clarify the procedure to follow for the succession to King SiHanouk - if ever one day he will die.In March of last year, a belonging to the Sam Rengie party was killed by a group of people in military uniform in the province of Kandal.In September two party members were arrested because they were involved in an attack carried out by launching a rocket against the prime minister.Note that it is the only party in Cambodia that does not have an armed arm.In October a parliamentarian of the same party was seized by men in uniform and released behind the payment of a redemption.The intimidation campaign is evident.A much more happens in Cambodia: torture inflicted on prisoners, involvement of the army and police in the trafficking of minors and women and immoderate use of preventive prison.All this is on the agenda.Even more serious is the refusal by the government to make Khmer Rossi leaders process from an international court.It is true: the civil war in Cambodia is over and political tensions are less accentuated.The way in which the political opposition is treated is a source of serious concerns and, if the situation does not change, this will also involve repercussions on the relationships between the European Union and Cambodia.Mr. President, in international law a new doctrine is increasingly imposing, according to which no state can afford to treat their citizens and residents as they want.Despite the presence of a democratically voted government, not even the principle of national sovereignty is more sufficient to prevent third countries from intervening in the event of clear violations of human rights.Chiari examples of what I just said are the Pinochet-Ugarte case, the crisis in Kosovo and, in a more moderate form, the debate born within the European Union regarding the new Austrian government.In Cambodia, however, this trend risks making a hole in the water if you cannot drag the responsible for the former revolutionary government before a court.At the same time, the fight against impunity is also endangered.This situation should remind us that the ratification of the Treaty for the creation of a court for international crimes was shamefully slowly.Mr. President, yesterday's debate on human rights was extremely useful;I am happy with this further opportunity to examine the situation of some regions of the world - Kosovo, Angola, Cecenia and Cambodia - in which the protection of human rights has proven to be a very difficult task.	it
The regulation could erroneously induce to think that this is, but in reality it is not so.For years, the commission has not made any changes in the regulation, despite the fact that Parliament has asked for it for some time.In practice, this means that in the short term these regions are reduced, once again, to receive only the funds in favor of the peripheral regions.The Parliament has asked for a common fund for cooperation with third countries to be established since 1996 to remedy the difficulties in this area, but nothing has been done!The problems continue to drag themselves, at the expense of the regions concerned.Parliament once again reiterates the request to improve and extend the cross -border cooperation, to set up a common fund and to further change the regulation in collaboration with the other commissioners.We want a Europe that responds to the needs of citizens and not a bureaucrat Europe!Mr. President, a third of the Union budget ends up in funds intended for the promotion of development, which my group finds excellent, as long as the delay of development of regions, cities and groups of people are eliminated, or the health and environment situation is better.It is a question of solidarity and progress.But the distribution of increasingly large sums of money does not represent a guarantee of improvement of the spending methods of those funds.The municipalities and regions that benefit from these funds in the meantime have made a certain experience and find that it is incredibly difficult to invest the resources in the sectors that have greater necessity.As a rule, projects related to economic growth and infrastructure give rather satisfactory results, while for projects in the social and environmental fields it is not always sure to obtain approval.Given the great uncertainty that reigns about the interpretation of the rules, regions and municipalities resort to the assistance of expensive consultancy offices.These experts are commissioned to have an estimate of the measure in which the officials of the European Commission are willing to approve the plans presented.In some cases, I have the impression that it is not a matter of solidarity or solution of the most urgent problems, but that rather aims to keep the interests made up and to make propaganda for the blessings that come from the European Union.It seems to me that the possibility of exposing an advertising billboard in which the this project is said to be co -financed by the European Union has become the main purpose.Too much money is spent in propaganda and consultancy offices, in consultations and controls, and a lot of money in the end returns to the coffers of the Member State that had originally paid it.After the foreseen adhesion of new Member States, whose standard of life is equal to one or two thirds of the average of the current Member States of the European Union, such a waste of resources will generate even more oppositions.During the commission for regional policy, transport and tourism, the confederal group of the European unitary left has agreed with the speaker for opinion on the leading program, honorable Nogueira Román, who rightly found that it is not wise to disperse resources among all the rural areas.	it
It would therefore be extremely important to receive said cumulative requirement.Finally, I repeat that, in my opinion, Pietro's colleague has done an excellent job by presenting a report that, in the framework of the scarce available opportunities, offers all the possible guarantees of safeguarding the rights of the individual and fundamental freedoms.However, if we want to give European citizens a greater sense of security, we must enhance judicial assistance.Mr. President, my group greets the fact that an agreement is launched to frame the daily practice of judicial assistance in criminal matters in a specific legislation.The proposal in question is complex, because it analyzes the agreements in force between the Member States, but implies profound consequences at the level of the relationship between the state and citizens.The Council's proposal highlights enormous deficiencies in the field of legal protection.According to Pietro's speaker, the proposal even presents colossal gaps.The Convention makes a whole chain of requests for judicial assistance possible, involving the authorities and judicial systems of other Member States in cascade.The way in which this practice is regulated means that the aforementioned chain cannot be kept under control in its entirety by any magistrate.Therefore, supplementary measures must be taken, such as the obligation of the investigators to testify, where required, within the scope of any criminal proceeding in which the material they collected is used.My group also disadvantly judges the fact that the Prime Ministerus tramples on the principle of proportionality.There are no field limitations, so the agreement does not only concern the fight against the most serious crimes and organized crime.Nowhere is it written that it concerns only criminal law, so that it is not unthinkable that the European Union will soon use heavy weapons to fight against small delinquency and that the rights of citizens will disappear, suffocated by the smoke of the dust.Mr. President, the Convention on Criminal Judicial Assistance, which we are examining today, contains the bare minimum for effective and quick collaboration between the various judicial or investigation bodies.It concerns notifications, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of prisoners, the return of goods, the testimonies for videoconference, the investigative activities and the so -called undercons, the telephone interceptions, and more.It is the minimum on which you can agree, and it must be immediately said that, if some amendments passed, such as n.32 or n.81, n.70 revised or n.71 revised, the whole agreement would be reduced only to the exchange of notifications or information and it would be truly to be thrown into the basket, and we would vote against.I hope that the common sense of colleagues from the various groups leads them to reject these amendments.Even the fact that this has not become a picture agreement but remained on the level of the conventions is a defeat for Parliament.As Commissioner Vitore will have noticed by all the various interventions, the need emerges to develop a picture of common rules, that is, not to go ahead like this, with this scattered order, with these small conventions concerning various sectors such as that of investigations or others.	it
In the system in use in the northern Member States, however, the financial component is applied differently.Everyone must pay, regardless of the fact that they then download their waste into the sea or they deliver them.This system is also integrated a sort of economic incentive that encourages ships to deliver their waste in port.It is a well -experienced system, which has been the subject of research and proven effectiveness.This is one of the reasons why Parliament and the Commission whose work are called to defend, they insist on the need to maintain a percentage of indirect costs by integrating it into anchor taxes.Step to illustrate in detail the essence of our proposal.The applied percentage must be 90 percent, the first point.We could also decide for 75 percent, but in any case it is necessary to guarantee a solid and consistent base, otherwise we will find ourselves again with a plethora of different systems before having, so to speak, learned the lesson we actually already know.I would therefore like to convince everyone that for the reasons I illustrated it is reasonable to opt for a system that intact or another in one way or another indirect costs in anchoring taxes.The Commission's proposal in its current form leaves to the Member State the freedom to reduce indirect costs up to 0.01 percent, if desired.And my fear is that everyone in the practical act will do just like that.In the future this will be the most important aspect on which we will have to concentrate our exchanges of opinion.The proposal contains many other elements, and on many of them we have reached an agreement.I am convinced that we will be able to find the solution, but what I illustrated to you is the core of the entire question on which it was my intention to attract the utmost attention of all.Mr. President, Mrs. Vice President of the Commission, honorable colleagues, first of all I would like to emphasize that in the two readings we had an excellent discussion.I sincerely thank the rapporteur, honorable Bouwman, for having resumed the dossier and for having illustrated it so well.With the Council we agree on three points.First: all European ports that still do not have it, must build adequate collection systems for ships of ships.The presence of these plants is therefore mandatory.Second: all ships, regardless of their flag, must provide for the disposal of the waste they generated.Third: the costs must be attributed to the ship in question.We agree on these elements.In practice we want to establish a system together to prevent there are cheap incentives to throw waste into the sea.First of all, we want to protect the flora and fauna, and secondly there are many coasts where not only many tourists arrive, but where it is necessary to create jobs.In short we want an effective system.In what our position is different from that of the Council, regardless of some small details, such as the exemption from the bureaucratic provisions that we ask for for the ships and the slightly more severe provisions we want for large fishing boats and pleasure boats?	it
"That is why, in the committee, there is now a change application from me to the change application 2, which includes the waiver of the term ""harmonization"".This happens in the knowledge that the council meets us a bit, we can then accommodate the council, because this directive, I think, is a reasonable step forward.Nevertheless, and the advice must know that, of course, it makes sense that the Member States in the council have to coordinate about such controls and threatened sanctions sooner or later, because it would be nonsense if z.B. in Finland almost a prison sentence on violations and only a small fine in a southern country, or vice versa.That makes no sense.That is also not European.Therefore, I would like to say again about the procedure: The application application 3 replaces the amendment tailored to the committee 2. So it would have to be voted on tomorrow.If this were told to the Presidium, which will head the vote tomorrow, I would be very grateful.Then we would not have a process problem.So coordinate the change application 3 first.The change application 2 would then replace.So it is discussed in the committee, and then we could have this regulation very quickly and do not strive for an elaborate mediation procedure for a basically sensible solution.President!Everything is said.Allow me to build a bridge to the Vice President so that you may support the change application 3, which replaces 2.There are sometimes MPs in the room who say: it makes sense to standardize the traffic controls in their rigor, in their density.But when it comes to the word harmonization of the sanctions, some flinch in this room - left and right, top and bottom in this house.That is why I find this application No. 3, which Mr. Piecyk formulated as a rapporteur, wonderful.He completely avoided the word harmonization.But he said what it was about.He said that it cannot be that the benefit of a commercial vehicle, a bus with passengers without compliance with the safety regulations - which leads to the endangerment of life and life of humans - is considered in a country as a cavalier offense and is seriously punished in another country.In view of the risk of passengers or the other road users, this would be necessary.Therefore, this is not the question: Are we for subsidiarity or are we for centrality?The point is that it is not concerned that we have the common goal of traffic safety, but some governments say: well, from the punishments we consider violations of traffic safety such as violations of the ban on entering any green areas, and the others weight it correctly.First principle, vice president: the same assessment of the need to improve traffic safety.The second argument is that there must be no distortion of competition in the community.There are examples that the trucks of another Member State in a country are particularly keen to control, be held, held, etc., and in another country it doesn't matter.That is the core of the difference between parliament and a common point of view: We already believe that the Member States should try to vote in connection with the sanctions that remain in their national jurisdiction: How do I rate the risk of traffic, and how do I make the equality of competition within the community in an internal market?"	de
I would like to approach a point of great importance concerning the impact on businesses, raised by Mmes Thyssen, Peijs and Palacio Vallelersundi: these are SMEs.Many speakers have pointed out.The Commission pays particular attention to legal certainty for SMEs.We propose a system that considerably improves legal certainty for SMEs.For what ?Is it just a political gesture?No.In this system, we propose to reform our important rules in such a way that most SMEs are covered by regulations in terms of exemption by categories, as in the field of vertical restrictions.Most SMEs have less than 30 % market share.We have a minimis notice containing the following declaration: Since SMEs are not involved in market domination, they are not normally subject to the strict prohibition contained in article 81, paragraph 1. We are in the process of developing exemptions by categories and additional guidelines which will take all accounts of the particular situation of SMEs.In addition, our white paper on modernization will also improve the situation of SMEs, first of all by the elimination of the bureaucracy resulting from the current notification system and secondly, by making article 81, paragraph 3, directly applicable, which will benefit in particular SMEs.(IT) Fourth, legal certainty.Admittedly, Mr. Evans, legal certainty is - I am the first to recognize it - essential for companies and not only for legal professions which however play a very important role in favor of European construction.Legal certainty is essential for businesses, this is one of the subjects including the president of the Legal Commission and the Internal Market, Ms. Palacio Vallelersundi - that I thank for her way of following the issues related to the single market in the broad sense and therefore, in this case, competition too - also underlined the importance in her latest intervention.I am convinced that this proposal will increase the legal security of companies, for three reasons: it will allow, without prior decision, under the direct effect of article 81, paragraph 3, all restrictive competition agreements satisfying the conditions of exemption;It will assist companies in case of doubt in terms of interpretation through the publication of motivated opinions;It will be accompanied by exemption regulations and guidelines aimed at clarifying the rules and ensuring its certainty.Ms. Thyssen also referred to the question of legal privilege for business lawyers.Allow me only to recall that the Court of Justice decided this question, as you know better than me, in 1982. This jurisprudence remains valid and nothing justifies that it is questioned.The white paper imposes a review of the question for only one of its aspects: the exchange of confidential information.The guarantees that must be given to companies are currently the subject of discussions.(IT) I come now, Mr. President, quickly to Mr. Rapkay's report, whom I warmly thank for the quality of his work and for the support given overall to the XXVIIIth annual report of the Commission on the Competition Policy.	fr
However, knowing and valuing precisely all situations and expectations is a little less than impossible task.I belong to a country whose half south appears to the Mediterranean and in which the availability of water historically responds to the whims of a volatile weather and a difficult conformation of the land.The Mediterranean region has had to fight for its development trying to overcome this adversity century by century, year by year, day by day until today.Therefore, we think the practical application made by the directive of the obligation collected in article 164 of the treaty related to the fact that community legislation takes into account the diversity of its regions.Precisely in application of this principle, the Spanish delegation of the European Popular Party will oppose the amendments 4 -Considerate 21-, 13 and 49 -Article 11, letter d) -, since they suppose a serious limitation for an exclusive management area of ​​the Member States such as the regulation of their water resources.It would be very difficult for the community to determine the conditions for its regulation in the different regions, given the different internal balances that are always at stake and that in any case require a deep knowledge of the different areas and interests affected.We also reject the amendments that seek to incorporate the full cost of water for the year 2010. Undoubtedly, we must set water prices that encourage their efficient use but, at the same time, allow maintaining the competitiveness of the productive sectors in the most disadvantaged regions and does not prevent their legitimate development.I want, finally, to refer to the amendments related to dangerous substances that establish that a degree of pollution zero or close to zero must be reached.The degree of zero pollution of any human activity has not yet been discovered.Ladies and gentlemen, we would do a bad service in general to the objectives of this important directive if we are not able to provide it with the necessary flexibility and adaptability to guarantee its compliance.I hope that, once again, this Parliament votes with a sense of reality and respect for the principle of subsidiarity, seeking an adequate balance between environmental objectives and economic and social considerations, the three essential elements to achieve the sustainable development that we all want so much.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, this is a very important directive.Its objective is to improve the quality of water and the safety of distribution systems.Citizens must have the right to clean water.This is important for both the environment and for public health.I do not speak so much in its own name, since it is casually part of the small group of privileged Europeans who can drink water directly in the nearest lake of the neighborhood.We must strive to quickly start the improvement of water quality.Let's start working now.We cannot afford delays.It is important that the calendar is ambitious.In my opinion, it is not too ambitious, if we take into account that the objective is that by 2020 we stop pouring impurities in the waters and we aspire that, by that date, the discharge index of impurities and harmful materials will be reduced to zero.	es
"As is well known, the European Commission should have submitted new proposals to change the directive 97/67 via postal services by the end of 1998, while maintaining the universal services and securing their economic viability, with a regulation for the gradual liberalization of the market for postal services as well as taking into account the consequences for those affected, including employees and customers.For this purpose, the Commission has commissioned studies on the costs of universal services, the effects of liberalization in cross-border postal traffic and the advertising disputes, the consequences of reducing weight and price boundaries in the exclusive range as well as the effects of the subsequent phases of the liberalization of the handling of mailings except for delivery.In addition, an overall assessment of the results of the studies should be carried out.We ask ourselves and of course the Commissioner - Mr. Bolkestein is not present, but Mr. Monti can certainly say something about his wide -ranging competence: Shouldn't the economic and social effects of the various scenarios intended for liberalization be examined on each, I repeat every member country of the European Union?The postal services look very different in Greece than in the UK, in the Netherlands very different from Belgium.How should after the liberalization of the universal post service in a country such asB. my country, namely Greece, are appropriately financed and organized, the geographical peculiarity of which is that it has many small but inhabited islands?How should an operator survive in my country who is obliged to offer universal services if the cross -border postal service is liberalized, even though this proportion is below 5 % in other countries?How should the national postal service be relocated abroad?You heard what Mr. McCartin just said about it.Since this is most likely to be decided gradually and controlled liberalization while setting the weight and price ranges, due to the technical developments that make this shift easier and thus more profitable, more profitable.But what should they look like?Will you be as naive and, like the ""Freuzützen"", will allow themselves to choose the most lucrative parts and to avoid the weight limits without any problems, since the content of the programs cannot be checked anyway?In any case, we ask the Commission to disclose the cards and present their proposals, whereby the intended overall development of this matter must be examined from all sides and for all Member States.Of course, liberalization is not an end in itself, but only a means of improving the services.Mr. President, revered Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!The prospect of liberalization of the classic national postal services inevitably raises the question of what the postal services consider in the future as their core business, in other words, what the postal services themselves, what they will no longer do in the international network and what they will no longer do.Against the background of the fact, this question must be answered that the sole monopoly is de facto through various courier services and technological developments such as fax and email.On the other hand, the focus is on the liberalization of postal services."	de
By attributing a de facto preference to products from establishments in occupied territories during the period of validity of these trade agreements, the EU violates two essential principles of international law: on the one hand the rules relating to the unilateral integration of occupied territories, and on the other hand the fourth Geneva Convention in 1949. Respect by the EU and the whole world of these two international principles being at the base of the peace process,Such offenses have the effect of undermining the foundations of the peace process itself.The EU must now choose between the desire to establish its relations with Israel and Palestine on the standards of international law, and thus strengthen the peace process, or do no case of international law.The choice should be simple.International law prescribes us not to set up commercial relations only with the countries and regions it recognizes, and not with territories whose membership is disputed.EU member states and Israel must comply with the rules contained in the trade agreement on the strict control of the origin of the products, and customs duties must be returned.He returns to the commission to watch.The intervention of Commissioner Vitorino gives us some hopes in this direction.You have to give a chance to the peace process in the Middle East.And this chance can only be based on international law.The EU is responsible for contributing to it.Mr. President, Messrs deputies, I would first like to thank all the deputies who made a rich and precious contribution to this debate when a question of great political sensitivity was addressed.If the Commission can afford to teach this debate, I would say that, we could conclude that, in broad outline, the Parliament is due to a strategy certainly prudent, but clear, which the Commission will also adopt to deal with this issue.The Commission does not ignore the political sensitivity of this theme and no doubts at any time because the progress aimed at finding concrete solutions for a concrete application of this trade agreement is closely linked to the evolution of the peace process in the Middle East.In fact, the political importance given to the peace process by the European Union finds an echo in Parliament and to the Commission, as pointed out by several deputies, and this interest results from the recent visit in this region of Madam President Nicole Fontaine, as well as Mr. President Romano Prodi last week.This is why we are well aware of being living a particularly delicate moment in the peace process, which should not be disturbed by positions that would result from a blind application of legal rules, since the application of the law requires that one is trying to find an acceptable solution for all parties.And in truth, the Commission adopted in this area a position aimed at obtaining the support and convergence of all the parties involved in this peace process.	fr
I would like to emphasize Mr. Schulz that we do not bring the amendments to the change as a person or out of personal considerations, but always in the context of a general political interest.If we wanted to set up a list of those who are investigated or wanted to search for such people, we could also find them among the rapporteurs, including the author's author.I therefore think Mr. Schulz could have saved his deliberate comments.As I said, numerous changes have been incorporated, which have the right to defend - I think of the obligation to apply by the investigative judge - or the fact that the common investigative groups must not belong to any civil servants who are also active as a judge.In principle, according to the will of the parliament, the convention should only apply to criminal law;The circumcision of fundamental rights and freedoms provided for in the Convention must therefore inevitably be limited to criminal law.We need safe rules.It is true, of course, that the council did not proceed uniformly, that it has changed his opinion during the procedure and is not present today.On the other hand, I would like to thank Commissioner Vitorino for being present here in the hall during the debate.So we need safe rules so that fair processes are conducted in the Union - without flooding through surveillance measures, without illegal use of video conferences;So that the Union never gets back to processes in which the judges instead of speaking right;So that the real culprits are punished and not innocent people who are uncomfortable to anyone.President!The draft of the Convention on Legal Aid in Criminal Matters between the Member States of the European Union is about to accept his acceptance by the Council.Most say it is time for it.After the action plan to combat organized crime, which was accepted by the Council in April 1997, work on the draft of the MLA Convention should be completed before the end of 1997.However, further time will pass before it will actually come into force in view of the fact that the ratification by the Member States is necessary.Even according to the new rules of the Amsterdam contract, which provide an entry into force, if at least half of the Member States have accepted the Convention, I would like to ask the Member States to do everything in their power in order to ratify this agreement as quickly as possible.Unfortunately, the experiences of the past in relation to the ratification of the European Union Convention in the area of ​​Justitial Cooperation in Criminal Matters are disappointing.With this Convention, no new or other system of legal assistance should be created.Rather, it aims to build on proven mechanisms that have been around for a very long time and how they provide for the European legal assistance agreement of 1959 and the Benelux contract.The draft created by the Council contains provisions on a variety of things that have been discussed by various MPs.It is a remarkable achievement of the Convention that the requested Member States, where possible, have to stick to the formalities and procedures, refer to which the requesting Member State refers.This is particularly important with regard to the possibility of using judicial evidence.	de
We still cannot continue to let destroy all our possibilities for action on the political level.Revenues from non -economic activities still cannot continue to increase ever more quickly.Since Tobin developed his idea, it turned out that in Germany, financial capital income has gone from 7.6 % of all income to almost double today.We cannot continue to see the poorest countries of this planet be hardest confronted with speculation that affects monetary fluctuations in the short term.I don't think it is unfeasible more.Why would it not be possible to identify an agreement between the states of the G7, the other states of the EU, China, Singapore and Switzerland on the introduction of the Tobin tax?There should be common economic interest.Why could we not achieve - differentiation can be made - to subject this tax to transactions aimed at the immediate exchange of currencies, the whole of what are called cash, long -term and optional operations on currencies?Why could we not fix the amount of this tax so as not to threaten long-term investments, essential on the economic level, but to finally make short-term investments and speculative investments?Many difficult questions will certainly ask themselves but the only important problem that I perceive is the political will and this principle of Sankt-Florian, also applicable today, which consists in repelling responsibility from one place to another.Madam President, as Mr. Karas said a few minutes ago, we do not ask for an additional bureaucracy.We are looking for solutions.There is no doubt that it is more clear on the capital markets: this is the idea.The Tobin tax will put some transparency in this very obscure question.The more we progress towards the liberalization of exchanges, the more rules we need.This is what Commissioner Lamy said at the opening of the Millennium Cycle in Seattle.He recognized that the combined effect of the single market and the single currency which characterize the process of construction of the European Union is intimately linked to a enormous volume of new regulations.Now that capital can immediately cross national borders without any difficulty, it is obvious that the same approach will be strictly necessary, especially since the amounts daily engaged in speculative transactions are enormous.We, citizens of the world, cannot accept the current level of speculation.Continue would be economic suicide.My dear colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, we often hear that Europe has managed to ensure financial stability, which is true if we stick to the public sector.But if we include the private sector, we see that this famous Financial Stability, not only has not been obtained, but that we are probably sitting on a volcano ready to explode at any time.Over -indebtedness of the private sector and the excessive surge in the equity prices that corresponds to it - the two major clues of financial market stability - have long been in red, as the commission's own report on Europe's economic situation demonstrates it in a way that does not ready to any dispute.	fr
In our opinion, a factor will influence the role of the Commission in the near future, which has to do with a certain revival of the European political initiative on the part of the governments of the Member States due to the failure of the Commission Santer.We consider this to be a very positive aspect, since the national parliaments, on which the governments depend on, can continue to penetrate the indispensability of their democratic mandate when building Europe.It is a fact that the European Parliament still does not gain the trust or even the interest of national public opinion, where one stubbornly refuses to think European, as the high proportion of non -voters to be determined in the last elections.So it is about strengthening the mechanisms used in the cooperation between the governments of the Member States by making them more coherent, more transparent and democratic.We welcome Romano Prodi's efforts to improve the Commission's public appearance and the need that it must communicate with the European Parliament and the Council.However, we are of the opinion that in the foreground the reform of the mechanisms of intergovernmental cooperation, in particular through the creation of a Council of Ministers for Europe, its members with each other and in coordination with the other European organs, assuming responsibility to ensure that the political decisions of the European councils result in concrete actions.Report Corrie (A5-0032/2000) Mrs. President!The work of the parity assembly in 1999 was characterized by the growing concern of the continued existence of the cooperation model resulting from the Lomé Agreement.As early as 1994, the parity assembly made itself in a first resolution in which our colleague Dominique Souchet played a significant part, worried about the foreseeable consequences of the Uruguay round, which had rejected the basic principle of the common community preferential for this cooperation.The cherished fears have been confirmed for two years.The most clear example of this is the banana dispute.Despite their unstable economies, the developing countries should adapt to the liberalization of trade.In the report by Mr. Corrie, this situation is criticized and the adherence to the parity assembly at the Lomé model is affirmed, but a second problem, which is basically also based on erroneous free trade policy, namely the incoherency of the regional trade agreements concluded by the European Union, is not sufficiently emphasized.The best example is the cooperation agreement with South Africa.The Council approved this agreement negotiated by the Commission, although the agricultural chapter, which was nevertheless, has not yet been finally regulated.As our colleague Paul-Marie Coûteaux aptly noticed in his yesterday's statements and in his amendments, one has to ask yourself what political logic may correspond to such a blank check.We are very concerned about it, all the more than a similar agreement with Mexico.The rapporteur's claim after integration of the European development fund into the budget of the community is also not acceptable.We would like to protect the clear obligation and responsibility of each Member State, as the intergovernmental character enables.Unfortunately, we have experienced too many examples in which the common help for which nobody feels responsible, we have been misused, and we want to avoid such a catastrophic system at the EEF.	de

Report (A5-0073/999) by Mr. Langen on behalf of the Committee on the Committee on the application of the Commission on the application of its decision No. 2496/96/EGKS of December 18, 1996Regulations on aid to the iron and steel industry (steel aid code) in 1998 (KOM (1999) 94- C5-0104/1999/2107 (COS)) (the parliament accepts the motion for resolution.)(FR) As is well known, the European Union is financed from four sources of income.The European budget is fed from VAT and the bip compartment, especially since with the loss of the community preference and the increase in the free trade zones, customs fees and the community agricultural creation have been eliminated after they had previously been cut by the APS.Since then, the volume and justice of the community own funds have been impaired to a considerable extent in a considerable extent by VAT frauds and distortions when calculating the bip as a tax base for the fourth resource.Therefore, with its federal pretentions, the Europe is financed more than ever like a banal intergovernmental organization, which it is, but does not want to be.This becomes very clear from the prescription present to us.One worries about the ""booking of your own funds"" to your ""provision"" or the ""control"" of the amounts provided to the Commission.In addition, the newly created advisory committee consists of representatives of the member states subject to contributions.You are far from the excesses, such as the ""Community Criminal Law"", the ""Community General Prosecutor's Office"" or to the Community Police with the Olaf.There is still no European federal tax here.However, the Europe will request the 25 according to a European income tax, unless you prefer a profit tax, or the 2025 budget is financed from CO2 taxation.Report Koch (A5-0105/1999).(FR) I am very pleased with this report on better harmonization in the training of security advisors for transport dangerous goods.The national and international dangerous goods transport have increased considerably over the past few years, which has increased the risk of accidents.In many cases, the accidents were due to the insufficient knowledge of the risks associated with these transports.So it proved to be necessary to take measures for better risk prevention as part of the creation of the internal market.Directive 96/35/EC corresponded to this requirement.The companies whose activity comprises the transportation of dangerous goods or the loading or unloading associated with this transport were rightly imposed on risk prevention, which apply to the transportation on the road, rail or inland waterways.In order to facilitate the implementation of this goal, Directive 96/35/EC stipulated the establishment of appropriately trained security consultants for the dangerous goods transport."	de
"A call to the majority of the Austrian people who have not voted for Haider, who has voted clearly democratic options, committed to Europe -and I have to point out that if Mr. Schüssel was a Minister of Finance, Foreign Minister Vranitzky also gave a hand in the Austrian integration process.You cannot be so politically sectarian.The entry of Austria in the community did it together.It was everyone's work, not a single group.Therefore, Mrs. President, I think we are in our right and in our obligation to ask the Austrians to reconsider and reconsider because that type of plague that we have already suffered in Europe can not only harm Austria, it can, where appropriate, extend, and speak with the memory of history.Therefore, I would like to know if the PPE, apart from the apology he has made of Mr. Schüssel, who will guarantee everything, as in 1938 Chamberlain and Daladier did so in Munich, plan to take measures in relation to the Austrian Popular Party if he goes on with this delirious project.Thirdly, if we do not rise against this Contramos Alliance, I can tell you, lordships, that the main objective of the European Union, which is the extension, can be terminated because, if you were Czechs or Slovenos or Hungarian, what would you say if they have a neighbor that deals with a racial base and does not want me to enter?Therefore, lordships, I think this is a great day for the beginning of political Europe.We support the Council and believe that we are in our right and in our obligation to address the Austrian people to seriously reconsider this absolutely delusional option.(Applause of the PSE group) Mrs. President, my group welcomes this debate with satisfaction because we are at a decisive moment.It is the first time in the history of the modern European project that we are about to attend the integration of a party of the extreme right.It is something deeply disturbing.The FPö argues that if we read its documentation and its program, we will find many things that we could share.It may be so, but today I want to record the long and difficult experience that the Democratic liberals live with the Austrian FPö party in our family of the Liberal International.Already in 1986 we had reasons to believe that Mr. Jörg Haider was not a man whose principles or attitudes were consistent with modern decency and liberalism.In November 1991, after a long internal debate in the Liberal International and numerous visits to Vienna to deal with problems, we suspended the FPö association and in July 1993 we expel it.We expel it then and continue to oppose what Mr. Haider defends.Let me share with you what we learned from that long experience.There were many who say ""read the text"", but there were many more those who say ""read between the lines."""	es
Mrs. President!In my double capacity as a member of the Grünen/Free European Alliance faction and as a member of the European Member of the Basque Nationalist Party, I would first like to express our decisive condemnation of the cowardly attack, the two people, which Ertzaina Jorge Díez Elorza and the Basque MPs and former Vice Eve of Fernando Buesa.Secondly, we express our condolences as well as our solidarity and compassion to this loss with all my heart with your family members, their socialist comrades, the Basque Parliament and the Basque autonomous police.Thirdly: We complain of the severity of an assassination, which not only ignores respect for dignity and human rights, but also disregarded the popular will by directed against a elected representative of the citizens.Fourthly: We express our disgust, because with this double murder the process of political normalization to achieve peace in the Basque Country is to be immediately destroyed.Fifth: We straighten up to the Spanish and French governing and politically responsible and ask them again to show the same proportion of proportion that was shown in the United Kingdom and in Ireland in order to be able to find a solution to the current Basque political conflict with others, which will not lead to each other alone.Sixth and most recently: We explain that terrorism and violence on the part of the ETA have to end and that it has to stop, the Basque citizens who have to decide freely and without violence about their future to take the will.Just three months ago, like many of my colleagues, I congratulated the Irish and British people in this plenary on their success to have found a solution to the Northern Ireland conflict.Too many people have been injured and murdered in Northern Ireland in the past thirty years - too many families have been destroyed.As far as the current conflict in the Basque Country is concerned, the opposite has happened in Spain and France.We from the Euskal Herritarrok are firmly convinced that the current struggle can only be ended through an open dialogue and transparent negotiations without a rigid agenda.In the nineteen months before January 20, there was only one murder in the Kingdom of Spain, namely the attack on ETA member Luis Geresta, who died in March 1999.Despite this attack and the arrests made by the Spanish and French police, also by ETA members who were in negotiations with the Spanish government, the ETA kept its one-sided ceasefire.In November last year, before the end of the ceasefire, the spokesman for the Spanish government, Mr. Piqué, said that his government had so far done everything to do so and that everything will do everything that will be able to prevent current efforts to find a political solution for the Basque Country.We, the Euskal Herritarrok, have often had to regret the loss of human life.Together with the Basque population, we carry the suffering of our people.We are for a dialogue and we are ready to work with all those who are striving for a democratic solution for the Basque Country.Since the Northern Ireland question was addressed for the first time in this parliament, twenty years have passed.	de
With these global documents, aren't we reinventing the Gosplan Mr. President?One can ask, especially when reads the French contribution that exaggerates in the sense of leadership by proposing that a whole series of national policies be coordinated in Brussels, for example in the fields of employment, social protection or SMEs, and by accompanying them with a wide battery of encrypted indicators whose surveillance should have been organized.A centralized control of this type would be translated by new violations of subsidiarity, new detail uniformizations, new pressing coordination imposed on countries that are in different situations, in a word new elements of rigidity that will be added to the rigidity of the single currency.The Lisbon Council should be set as a goal, in our opinion, eliminate that rigidity, foster flexibility, adaptation, exchange positive national experiences to stimulate creativity that will only prosper thanks to the freedom of choice of peoples.Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, distinguished colleagues, in the speeches we have heard, a sublime objective has been mentioned, specifically, the objective that, as Europeans, we become competitive in front of the United States, we become interlocutors of the United States into equal rights.Actually, this should be possible if we consider our gross domestic product.However, if, on the other hand, we consider, for example, in the field of people - at the time of finding a new president of the FMI - how Europeans behave at this point in front of the Americans, then we are, without a doubt, still far away from this collaboration in equal rights.Now, we have to ask ourselves why this is.There are sectors, certainly, in the economic field - even in the field of media - in which we have leading positions.I refer, for example, to mobile phones.Here, in the plenary room, we have prohibited them with full reason, as they are instruments of torture.But, at the same time, in some areas they also constitute a substantial help in life, because they generate jobs.In this area we Europeans go in the lead.Because?We are in the lead because we have managed to reach a common European regulation in this area, a common European standard that has become a world rule today.This means that if we, Europeans, we strive on time, we will also be competitive in this area of ​​new technologies.Where are Europe's deficit?I believe, Mr. President of the Council, that we cannot eliminate the deficit instituting more observatories, as is currently planned.I believe that these observatories generate a few jobs for officials, but do not create jobs in small and medium enterprises.In Europe we have deficit in the training level.This indicates that in the field of new media we have to make imports from countries outside of Europe.Europe lacks, as has already been said, business, entrepreneurial spirit.	es
In the European Union, the OICVMs have achieved great success: they are a safe and negotiated product across the border.But the time has come to update the legislation that regulates them and it is here that honorable Schmidt has carried out an excellent work.However, I must recognize that I am not enthusiastic about the considerable changes made to the Schmidt report in Parliament.I invite the classroom to take on a balanced and reasonable approach on the topic under discussion.The radical measure adopted by this report is to allow the OICVM to use derivative securities negotiated out of stock exchange.I ask all those present to evaluate the products that will be used by the OICVMs;We are not talking about the use of derivatives for speculative purposes, but of their use to reduce the risks and increase profits on the savings of ordinary European citizens.We have to congratulate us with the honorable Schmidt for obtaining the support of Parliament on derivative titles negotiated out of stock exchange.We must not be afraid to go on and to react to market changes.We must persevere in our efforts, so that OICVMs offer consumers a balanced and protected product;The report protects consumers in a truly adequate way.Some amendments, however, excessively limit the use of derivative titles negotiated out of stock exchange.I believe that this type of derivatives will constitute a supplement to the portfolio of investment funds, and this can only favor individual European citizens who will obtain high profits from their savings.I pay homage to the honorable Schmidt.Many thanks honorable Kuckelkorn.Ladies colleagues, meanwhile, are able to give you news relating to the issue of the screen and the window.If we remove this screen, we will find behind a temporary wall that cannot be removed now.We will therefore have to postpone this experiment to the next plenary session.However, I will make sure that on that occasion a test is made to see the effect it has.Mr. President, from his entry into force, on 1 October 1989, the OICVM directive has found enormous success mainly thanks to the high level of protection of the investors that it guarantees.The investment funds sector has made use of the directive and the positive image of the OICVMs at investors to quintupy their activities in the European Union.The cross -border marketing of investments within the European Union has strongly developed and the directive itself has become exemplary legislation worldwide.However, it is clear that, after ten years, given the development of the markets and the offer of new increasingly sophisticated financial products, it is now a little dated.The proposals of the commission that is discussed in the classroom allow you to operate the lifting it needs.I share some of the concerns expressed - in particular by the honorable García -Margallo - however this lifting would be even more adequate if the funds that simply reproduce a scholarship index - and that are therefore managed passively or, better, that are not at all managed - and those who use an index as benchmark for a fund managed actively in the same way, was nothing more than to allow the companiesmedium size that are listed on the stock exchange, although not appearing in the scholarship index, to obtain better access to the capital market.	it
It would also be the first time that the European Parliament weakens a point of view of the council, while in general - I believe - we act the other way around.By a free return of the old vehicles e.g.B. and the increase in the recycling share would expand the corresponding economic activities and thus arise new jobs.In the interest of the consumer, the environment and the jobs that are newly created in the recycling industry, the common point of view of the council, which is completely acceptable in its current form, must not be changed.Mr President, like many of those present, I also consider this to be a good measure.It is a sensible measure that we all need.The technical problems were essentially clarified.Some individual questions still have to be clarified, but the majority of the technical problems are solved.We have reached the last question.In the debate on the first reading, this question was only asked by the committee for economy and currency and presented to the parliament as the author of the statement of this committee.It is very simple: who pays?In its common point of view, the council suggested a reasonable compromise that says that the manufacturers should bear a considerable part of the costs, but not all costs, as Mr. Bowis mistakenly stated.As the lawyers tell us, actually not more than 20 % or a fifth of the costs.That's probably not too much.For example, if you look at the British consumer who buys a Rover cited by Lange or any other car brand in the United Kingdom and has paid excessive prices for these cars for years, which are far above comparable prices in other parts of Europe, why should it pay?He already paid.Why should the same people pay as taxpayers or future car buyers for the disposal of vehicles where the manufacturer has earned?I can't accept that.Today we have some amendments that suggest that.I can't accept that, and I won't be right for that either.The manufacturer lies responsibility for these vehicles.The manufacturer must provide the corresponding infrastructure and bear a reasonable part of the disposal costs.The common point of view does not rule out the possibility of participation by the state.The common point of view is a reasonable compromise.Some of the amendments submitted today are completely unreasonable in that the automobile manufacturers of their responsibility for assuming a part of the costs for the disposal of motor vehicles.I cannot accept that, and I therefore vote against these amendments in the name of European taxpayers and consumers.Mr. President, my dear ladies and gentlemen!There is agreement that we have to worry about how we deal with old cars in Europe, but in this case the Council has not given an example of a sensible European environmental policy.It was embarrassing how the German Council Presidency dealt with this topic.First of all, Mr. Trittin, the Environment Minister, did not adequately coordinate with his colleagues in the cabinet, after which Chancellor Schröder interfered in this procedure like an elephant in the porcelain shop without expertise.	de
If it exists, we have led to this assembly throughout the last year.I have been here for 20 years and I have found absolute confidence between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.We have had our problems and we have contemplated difficulties, but there has been no situation in which the citizens of the European Union distrust, doubt or fear of this bureaucratic commission because our affairs were defectively managing.This is a huge exaggeration of existing difficulties.This commission should not live forever in the shadow of the errors that caused the resignation of the preceding commission.While there were problems - and we have to solve them in anticipation of expansion, for example - on some occasions we carry the negative aspects too far.Mr. President, estimated commissioners, first of all, I cannot stop thinking that this debate, as regards the speakers, is Dutch-English-Scandinavo.Maybe it's a bit disturbing.I hope, like many others, that the state of exception of relations between the Commission and Parliament is disappearing.It is not good that we continue running from one place to another to turn off fires.On the contrary, as Blak said, you have to create a system with clear functions.First, we need a system of solid standards, whose application is possible.It is not enough with codes of conduct or ethics committees.There must be consistent norms that, among other things, indicate what can be decentralized, which can be commissioned to others and what is independent.It seems a bit alarming that in this debate there is independence, without defining it and without specifying the right of decision.Therefore, in the EU a basic system of administrative norms is needed, for its institutions and for their relations with the member countries.This does not exist.We have pointed out a community prosecution and criminal law, but a community administrative law is also required.We would advance quite a lot if the Commission approved the proposal of Code of Conduct for good administrative practices made by the delegate.The Van Hulten report constitutes a step in the right direction, but it is not enough.Secondly, we must clarify our own role in the reviews.The Court of Auditors studies whether something is in accordance with the standards, but does not take care of controlling its usefulness.It is the European Parliament in charge of doing political evaluations.We do not pursue criminals, it is the task of the Olaf.Tell me, for example, to which national parliament the documents of a summary are sent.I mean, with the stubbornness of the drunk, that the Document Advertising Regulation will have to be much better than the draft that has circulated online;Otherwise, we will not get anywhere in this fight.Mr. President, I want to thank the speaker sincerely for his report.I am glad to be able to address him in Dutch, after Mr. Van den Berg has done.Otherwise, perhaps I would have felt something guilty.	es
It would be very beneficial, not only for Tibet and for all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia, but also would be much for the reputation of the Government of the People's Republic of China, who responded to those attempts to establish a dialogue.Question No. 31 Formulated by (H-0795/99): Subject: Regulation related to the good administration of the EU rejected by the commission according to information appeared in the press, the Commission has rejected the proposal of Mr. Jacob Söderman, defender of the European people, on the right of citizens to a good administration in the EU.The commission itself has accepted the idea of ​​a regulation in the field, but has not admitted at this time the concrete proposal made, but has limited itself to giving a series of complementary instructions on the improvement of the service.Is this information true?What is the reason for the action of the commission and how does it plan to explain the difference that its procedure generates between the words and the facts in regard to the reform of the EU administration?Does the commission that what happened is in line with the five -year program agreed in September by the European Parliament and the Commission?Is the commission to submit a detailed proposal on the regulations related to good administration so that Parliament can also comment on it?He has the floor, on behalf of the commission, Mr. Patten.The information appeared in the press referred to in the honor are, in my opinion, deceptive and inaccurate.In November 1999, the Commission approved in the first reading a code of good administrative behavior to incorporate into its regulations.At this time the commission is consulting the representatives of their staff about the document, a process that will be completed in the coming weeks.The Commission will then approve the code in second reading.It should be noted that the new commission gave immediate course to the decision of the European people defender of July 28, 1999 with their consultation on their own initiative about the code.The Commission would want to stand out in particular that in the drafting of the Code all the projects of recommendations of the European People's defender has taken into consideration.The Code will be a document that will exclusively deal with the relations of the commission administration with citizens.It will be approved through a legally binding decision of the Commission that will be published in the Official Gazette of the European Communities.The document has been prepared by fully taking into account the provisions included in the draft prepared by the European People's defender's office.In accordance with the relevant provisions of the treaties, the legislator responsible for establishing the commission's regulations is the commission itself.However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of maintaining a regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of administrative reform.Mr. President, I want to thank Mr. Commissioner and I would still ask him that when is these instructions planned to enter into force? Given that they have been being carried out since 1997. The information appeared in the press were misleading.	es
Maybe it ends up understanding that the cultural activities of the European Union do not involve any danger, but that they suppose a chance!Cultural collaboration - is another point where we have insisted - really creates an identity, much more than any transport directive, however important it is.Everyone agrees that it is necessary to promote culture, which cannot be said of all political decisions.Thus, I ask the advice what you are afraid.Mrs. President, who, as I have the honor of presiding over the Culture Commission, can only share what was manifested by the different colleagues and cannot congratulate the speaker and Commissioner Mrs. Reding, as well as, everyone has said it, whom he has worked and who, also during the reconciliation, has had moments of difficulty and has fought against the Council.I have been able to verify that the principle of a necessary culture in the organizational level has been strongly affirmed but with few possibilities of meeting all the requests that will formulate the states of Europe.I want to underline that I am not satisfied that, in the end, it has not been possible to approve a review clause.There is, of course, the availability and forecast of Mrs. Reding that has been personally committed to address the issue again and make a global evaluation within a few years and, consequently, to determine a new situation.To the cultural programs -Caleidoscope, Ariadna, Rafael- that were established in the past years, replaces them a unique program, culture 2000, in which - it must be emphasized with a lotdemocracy.I believe that these are not rhetorical words, but a new element of a modern liberalism that unites European states and constitutes the turn of the European Parliament and the Commission.We are in tune with this line and the result that this afternoon exposes, despite the meager of financing, I think it serves to significantly relaunch this strategy and this opportunity for Europe that, in the end, determines an economic factor and a development factor and, therefore, the culture, the institutional and organizational element of a large community as a budget of economic development, and not the opposite, as perhaps Europe, following a cultural custom, following a cultural custom, following a cultural custom, it was accustomed to considering a cultural custom.years.There is a prevalence of the human being, a prevalence of culture and this culture can determine economic development.We have to consider this result, congratulate ourselves for him and give ourselves a patent of great openness regarding a useful strategy.Mrs. President, allow me in the first place to express my thanks to Mr. Graça Moura for having known how to weave that way in the plot something complicated that has constituted this conciliation tapestry.I consider it very appropriate that at the beginning of the conciliation procedure for culture 2000 we have been able to count on a poet that guides us in our work.Once again, because these conciliations are not entirely easy, we must thank the Vice President Imbeni his copies negotiating skills in the intricate scope of ensuring that in our community we are granted funds for culture and proper use of them is made.	es
We can debate this a little later.But I note that reality corresponds exactly to what I say, namely that prices have lowered in the areas where competition reigns, when they have increased where the post office remained a monopoly.It almost always happens as well.This is why I ask today that the Commission takes the necessary initiatives and that it ensures that the competition really sets out in the postal sector.Mr. Markov, you will have a few minutes in five or six minutes.I will be grateful for not interrupting your colleagues.Mr. President, there is a mystery.What happened to the postal services directive that was adopted on December 15, 1997?Between this date and today, the silence of the commission has been deafening.I'm sorry that it is Commissioner Monti who is present today.I appreciate it very much.He is one of the most diligent and most workers commissioners.I regret not being able to say as much of some of his colleagues.During this period, the Postal Services Directive has not indicated any real progress.Commissioner Monti said it came out in part from the organization and the new task allowance.All this only took place recently.For more than a year, the former commission could have worked on this file.We have hardly advanced.However, since Commissioner Monti is here, I would like to charge him to tell the Commissioner Bolkestein what the directive on postal services was dealing with.It dealt with progressive liberalization, a universal service guaranteed at a reasonable price, it dealt with the maintenance in the reserved sector of direct mail and cross -border mail.These questions were fundamental in the report concerned and they should be fundamental in any future directive.The postal service is not limited to the Christmas period.It is useful life.In the region of Scotland where I come from, it is much more than a simple postal service.It is used to maintain the link between communities.Postal service is also the bus service.Postal service is also social service.Postal service is also the doctor.If we authorize the complete privatization of postal services, we will lose all this and many of our local communities will lose their tourism - we voted earlier on this subject.We will cut them from the world.Postal services are important.This message must be transmitted from this enclosure today.The commission must listen to it.Mr. President, we are in favor of the liberalization of postal services in the European Union.This liberalization must first note that customers will be better served.This is the orientation, such must be the final objective.Liberalization began because we had doubts about the structure of postal services, on the value of a monopoly.Is a monopoly flexible enough in a market where customer demand can change very quickly and where the market situation can also vary very quickly, because we would use, for example, much more importantly the electronic information media?	fr
"The EU/ACP agreements are mocked by the democratic principles and the fight against corruption, saving their managers: when in fact the sanctions and control of the total-elf, who feeds the supporters of the civil war in the Congo?When is a Shell check?Although the market is presented as the only rule that must regulate EU/ACP relations, the European Union also provides for a police management of immigration, as it suggests Article 13, which justifies the policy of European states against immigrants without documents.We do not accept this agreement as it deprives the populations of the means necessary to create companies that are independent of multinationals and European banks.Mr. President, I would like to praise the sincere commitment of European deputies - including some of my Labor colleagues - as part of the ACP -EU equity assembly, and praise their efforts aimed at guaranteeing a new Lomé agreement, which will benefit some of the poorest countries in the world.Few citizens of my electoral college are probably aware that the EU is the largest world donor in the field of international aid.Others perhaps have more powerful missiles, but the EU can draw on more substantial funds.This is an aspect of which the European Union can be proud, and that perhaps we should underline more often.Even the successes obtained by the Labor government in Great Britain are not negligible at all.Clare Short, deputy of the current British Parliament, is the owner of one of the few ministries for international development in the world, and in this guise he can make his voice heard of the government.In the meantime, deputy Gordon Brown has guided international efforts to relieve the huge debt of the third world and has been used to so that the Labor campaign for the reduction of poverty did not stop at the sleeve.The Labor goal of reducing poverty remains unchanged everywhere, it is clear, guaranteeing a minimum wage in Manchester or beating itself for the reduction of debt to Durban.Of course a lot still remains to be done.The new great challenge we must face is the relaunch of the new round of negotiations for world trade failed in Seattle last December.It must be a ""round for development"", to which developing countries, excluded from the previous rounds, can participate fully.In fact, the best way to reduce poverty in the world is to encourage the autonomy of developing countries;more than aid they need trade;They want a hand, but not our alms.The best way to help them is to open the world markets to allow them to sell their products;In this way, the strength of globalization can be exploited for good, for the benefit of the poor and not only of the rich, for the benefit of many and not only of a few.With the New Deal in Newcastle or fair trade in FreeTown, the goal of the Labor Party remains unchanged: opportunities for everyone.SwoBoda report (A5-0031/2000) The stabilization and association agreement between the EU and ERIM, in the form of a mixed agreement pursuant to article 310 of the EU Treaty, can contribute to reporting stability and development in this Balkan Republic and therefore the financial support granted through the Phare program could be decisive."	it
"The common will to overcome this terrible and still current history of the twentieth century, when all humanistic ideals were destroyed in the middle of Europe, is the real importance of the European Union.And if a government with neo -fascists is received somewhere in Europe, it is not just a question of national sovereignty.Because our Union is not a loose network of nation states that come to terms with each other in order to face better.It is a community of fate in which when it comes to essential questions when basic values ​​are at risk, all democrats have to search for solutions to prevent the mistakes of the past from repeating themselves.We should draw the teachings from the past.In the 1930s, when Adolf Hitler was democratically chosen, a minority believed that it was not that bad, and, Mr. Poettering, in my country, some people from the right warehouse thought, but certainly also representatives of other currents: ""Dear Hitler than the Volksfront"".They gave priority to small -scale party ducks instead of concentrating on the essentials - and there was a disaster.We have to react quickly, decided and together.I would have liked to have seen it, Mr. Poettering, if you had spoken to the Austrian President, which is known that this dirty coalition government is very embarrassed.So we have to react quickly and quickly.Of course, the contract offers protection when the situation becomes unbearable, I almost said ""not to make up"".The story has taught us that the fascists are going to do after the change of change: First hot - populist and xenophobic speeches - then cold - they are presentable, are represented in institutions that they gradually infiltrate and undermine them in order to then hit one day.And then it's too late.Now protective measures are provided in our contract if it is too late.But we are not that far: Today it is important to prevent it that is that far.So we need a political solution.Therefore, I support the council's proposals and at the same time regret the somewhat careful and tentative behavior of the Commission, which should actually be constantly determined and vigilant, because the fascists calculate with the weaknesses of democracy, they set temporary time to worry and hope to finally assert themselves.So we have to react quickly.If we do not support the council today, the story will judge us and speak of a ""political Munich"".Mrs. President!I am pleased that in Austria the will of the vast majority of the population is respected and that democracy has achieved a very significant victory in my eyes with this government formation.One thing has to be said very clearly: to a Europe that has developed into a kind of big brother who wakes up in a Stalinist and with Stalinist methods about the left -wing political correctness of the Member States, we say to such a Europe: No thanks.European democracy and Austrian democracy do not have to be instructed by anyone, in particular not from the Belgian government, which belonged to the corrupt parties financed by arms dealers and who have appointed the chairman of a corrupt party as a member of the European Commission."	de
"Essentially - with a legal modification - the Commission will systematically move away from the current centralized system of preventive approval of each financial transaction by the financial controller and instead strengthen the internal control systems of the expenditure of the departments so that the general directions are more equipped to take responsibility for the decisions that may affect the budget of the European Union.In addition, to have more guarantees than those provided by the current system, the new decentralized control system must be accompanied by an internal audit service - the second key, as the honorable Bösch called it - in line with the recommendations of the expert committee.This service will begin to operate on May 1 of this year, will be guided by a highly qualified accounting auditor, and its independence must be and will be guaranteed through new provisions to be added to the financial regulation.The new service will have to respond to me of his work, and will be joined by an audit committee chaired by colleague Schreyer, who I am happy to see tonight in the classroom. As a commissioner for the budgets, it is already responsible for relations with the Court of Auditors.This audit committee will ensure that the internal accounting reviews are then followed effectively and rigorously.I want to underline forcefully that modifying our control systems does not mean making them less severe.The proposed changes will make the most effective systems both as regards the information they will receive, and in relation to the weighted and responsible results they will provide.I can also explicitly guarantee the classroom that we will not adopt what is sometimes called ""a big bang approach"".Financial checks in force on the expenditure of each organ will be abandoned only after the new internal control system on the expenditure of each department has shown that it is fully adequate.I am a bit surprised that paragraph 10 of the resolution project does not seem to move any fundamental criticism of the current centralized character of financial control, contrary to both reports of the Committee of independent experts.This committee said very clearly that it is necessary to abolish the centralized system so far in force, and has also been explicit on the need to separate the internal accounting reviews from financial control.I also do not believe that paragraph 10 of the resolution project fully reflects the opinion expressed by the Court of Auditors in 1997. Of course, the Court may, after careful reflection, express its opinion towards the changes proposed for the financial regulation, but it is useful to remember the comments made in the classroom last month by President Karlsson.He said that the internal control of the Commission is not effective enough to prevent incorrect operation.For example, the financial controller had granted the preliminary visa in most cases of bad management and irregularities recently discovered.In addition, the internal accounting review function is carried out, without adequate coordination, by various bodies, such as the financial controller itself, the general inspectorate and some units of the general directions.Originally the centralized preventive approval system was undoubtedly suitable for guaranteeing adequate control, but with the passing of the years it has ended instead to reduce the degree of responsibility of officials on decisions."	it
"We are looking forward to interest and confidence of a concerted strategy for modernizing social security systems in Europe, which, however, must not be separated from a parallel rapprochement process: this means modernization, but also cohesion, as the rapporteur, to which we agree, highlighted in his report.In many policy areas, this latter path, although under trouble, was initiated, but in many others it has to be hit before Europe, be it, be it, even when considering the principle of subsidiarity, really a common house not only for the citizens of the Member States, but also for the people of the accessible countries.The European systems of social security have also always played a positive role in the social and democratic development of every people;And since these systems today have to continue to act as support for development in view of the further development of the economy, the world of work and the needs of society, they must of course be modernized.Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize three aspects: First, there must be a closer, directly proportional connection between economic policy, employment policy and social security policy.Second, it is about managing the systems of social security and their carriers.Nowadays, more extensive and effective measures are taken in the area of ​​additional and supplementary provision.In our opinion, however, this should not mean that the role of the public sector is weakened, both because of the universality and because of the - desirable - quality of the basic services of social security.This is basically a principle of justice that applies to the healthcare system, for the pension systems, but also to the social welfare sector, in which the public sector of the strategic coordination - which - albeit in a new form - cannot evade.The third aspect affects the principle of subsidiarity, which is based on the Union.To date, there is no common strategy of social protection and social security, and the applicable systems are essentially based on the procedure and on solidarity within the Member States.When modernizing these systems, the differences between the individual states - be they now member or membership states - are not neglected in the areas of economy, employment and social protection.The modernization, which is closely associated with a process that is closely based on different requirements, must therefore strive and promote developments in the sense of an increase and not a lowering of the social protection level.This is a question of culture, progress and the common dignity of the current and future expanded European Union.The common values ​​of the Member States of the European Union are based on democracy, human rights and freedom as well as a social market economy.This spirit must be expressed in solidarity with the weak groups in our society and the outside world.In accordance with the subsidiarity principle, the Member States design their social security systems themselves. However, all citizens of the European Union should be able to enjoy a minimum supply by a social security network, regardless of the country in which they live.In the report, an ""effective and ambitious tax coordination"" is required without define it in more detail.In our view, such an opinion means too much intervention in the national tax policy and therefore cannot find our support."	de
"Honorable deputy, pursuant to the regulation is not possible.You have to talk out of the hemicycle.Questions addressed to Commissioner Barnier announces question no.44, of the honorable (H-0020/00): subject: partnership and III QCS for Greece the new regulation 1260/1999/EC on structural funds puts the emphasis, contrary to the previous regulation, on the strengthening of the partnership and provides for the participation of the regional and local authorities as well as other competent public authorities, of the economic and social parties, and of any body responsible for this area, as regards both the preparation and the preparation.financing, surveillance and evaluation of the interventions.However, as regards the new Greek QCS, the representatives of the local authorities repeatedly complain that the procedures have remained similar to the previous and at all essential as regards the role of the ""partners"".Did the Greek state proceed to the modification of the procedures in order to expand to the composition of the social relationship, essentially towards local authorities and other representative instances?What is the growing role of the local authorities in the preparation and management of the III QCS, and what measures intends to adopt the commission to ensure the strengthening of the participation of the ""partners"" ""all the procedures of the new QCS?Of Mrs. Wulf-Mathies, I believe that this letter maintains its validity and that I commit myself to mutual agreement with Margot Wallström to verify the compatibility of the projects financed by the structural funds with the directives and policies of the union on the environment.tell him, in response to his question, that the Commission has monitored and will monitor, in the field of preparation of the new programming period, the application of the principle of partnership.The association of regional and local authorities with the action of the community constitutes, I allow myself to remember it, although you know it, an essential element of the new regulation of the structural funds after Berlin.By the way more in particular than the application of this principle of partnership in the context of the next community support framework for Greece, the Commission has been able to ascertain that the public authorities have widely contributed to the elaboration of the Hellenic Plan of Regional Development for the period 2000-2006.Mr Alavanos knows, I went there twice in rather tragic circumstances, after the drama of the earthquake;On the occasion of these visits I was able to discuss the Hellenic government authorities and remember the need to adequately consider the goal and the need for the partnership.As regards, honorable deputy, the subsequent phases, that is, the elaboration of national and regional programs, is not enough to transpose the objective at national and theoretical level, it is necessary to do it concretely in the programs that implement the QCS at national, regional and local level.As for the surveillance and management of the programs, for the moment I have not yet received the national provisions proposed by the Greek government in application of article 8 of the new regulation."	it
Since approx. 80 % of the European population live in urban areas, the cities are the focus of Europe's economic, social and cultural development.At the same time, the social and economic problems of European society in cities are much more expressed.Many European cities are confronted with an internal territorial break, which is expressed in the fact that in one and the same city quarters in which economic activities are located with high value creation and live strongly inhabitant residents, among other quarters, which are characterized by low income, mediocre and overcrowded apartments and strong social welfare dependency.The concentration of social and economic problems in certain urban areas requires targeted intervention that meets the complexity of the problems.Therefore, the European Parliament has successfully demanded the continuation of the Community Initiative (GI) Urban as part of the reform of the structural funds.The success of urban in the planning period 1994/1999 is undeniable.Concrete successes have been achieved in the form of improving the quality of life in the funding areas.This GI has promoted the development of good practices in the economic, social and ecological field.One of their successes consisted of strengthening the role of local authorities, non -governmental organizations and the local authorities as well as in the promotion of new partnership forms in urban resuscitation.With the new initiative, these goals are increasingly continued, with the focus in particular on promoting the equal opportunities of men and women as well as the integration of the socially excluded and disadvantaged groups.Your assumption is therefore only to be welcomed.However, it can be determined that we have no reason to cheer in financial terms, because the intended middle equipment is far from being the challenges to be mastered.It has shrunk from 900 million euros for the period in 1994/1999 to 700 million for the years 2000/2006, which corresponds to a reduction by 30 %!This reduction has led to a reduction in the number of programs as part of the new Urban initiative.The chosen upper limit of 50 programs is undoubtedly too low.It must be increased in order to be able to take regional and local peculiarities into account without the central grants to be reduced to the Member States.In view of this concentration on a limited number of projects, the publication and distribution of the results of the new community initiative Urban may play a crucial role in achieving a multiplier effect.The McCarthy report on the Urban Community Initiative is an opportunity to think about the appropriateness of community intervention in the field of cities.The location of certain urban areas is alarming because the social hardship is expressed in the form of unemployment, misery and crime.In particular through drug trafficking, uncertainty and procurement crime lead to.The effectiveness of the structural funds remains doubtful to such social problems.Because of the subsidiarity, we should actually say that the state is better able to intervene here in a reasonable manner in the exercise of its sovereign tasks and the local authorities, namely the state to ensure security and the local authorities to support needy.The intention to create a system for the exchange of proven practices can only be welcomed, but the specific problems of the individual urban areas are not always comparable.The Urban Community Initiative, together with the intention of the European Union, depends on urban politics.	de
This weighs all the more severe than the new situation, which is created by the course taken by the extension of the extension around regions such as Malta, is not taken into account.That is why we propose to extend the eligible regions at least to the nuts III borders of Sicily - in connection with Malta - and to all regions of the Adriatic - in connection with the Balkans.President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would like to express my satisfaction that the regions in the extreme outer location, which also include French overseas departments, was given a certain attention as part of the Interreg III Initiative.This opened up new opportunities for cooperation with the countries of their geographical zone.Nevertheless, it should be noted that we could have expected better results, especially at the level of access to the individual orientations.For a long time, and this is undoubtedly due to the continuation of colonial ways of thinking, our regions have directed the view of their European capital and even ignored their closest neighbors.This phase is clearly overcome today.Our regions have become aware of the affiliation to an environment that they are bound not only for geographical, but also for cultural reasons and due to the history of their peoples.Therefore, the will, which was expressed unmistakably, comes after a firmer anchoring in this environment.However, this new self -image does not only affect identity.It is also based on the fact that we got to know our advantages better.The island of Réunion is on an axis of the exchange between the states of southern Africa and Southeast Asia.It cannot afford a demarcation from the regional groups active in this zone, otherwise it could be missed a historical opportunity.This also applies to our Caribbean region.Ultimately, we are convinced that our youth can find a way out of the discouraging, dramatic unemployment if we can export your know-how to neighboring countries with the help of the European Structure Fund.By using interreg funds, our regions can develop into true bridgeheads of the European Union in their respective geographical zones and thus give it a global dimension.I count on the commission, and above all on you, Mr. Commissioner, when it comes to making these regions available to the funds for effective measures.Mr. President, Dear Members of the Commission, the opportunities for increased Trans -European cooperation within the framework of Interreg encounters my pronounced approval, but I have to express my concern that the proposal contains fewer possibilities of this kind for coastal regions than for the other regions.I understand the concern of the Commission that large distances can have a negative impact on effective cooperation.Nevertheless, there are a variety of coastal areas between which contacts have already been linked.The numerous municipalities on the North Sea are an excellent example of this.Interreg would be very possible to reinforce this cooperation.For this reason, I would like to enforce some minor corrections on the guidelines and thus cause a little more flexibility and that the interests of sea areas that are often located between orientation A and orientation B are taken into account.For example, the possibilities for cooperation between coastal regions and the creation of a freedom for the increased design of practical and visible projects should be analyzed, especially in the area of ​​infrastructure.	de
There are also divergences between the national legal disciplines as well as delays in the rogatory, which sometimes even remain unraveled.Not even the agreement relating to the protection of the financial interest of the communities, signed by the European Council in 1995, and the two connected protocols have changed this state of affairs: to enter into force, the agreement must be ratified by all 15 Member States, while to date - and five years have already passed - only four have done it.Such immobility risks undermining the credibility of the Union and led Parliament to propose the establishment of offices of the European Prosecutor's Office.We do not propose in any way to give life to a transnational criminal and judicial system, but to equip the union of the tools necessary to protect its financial interests, in full compliance with subsidiarity.The report we are debating resumes this idea and asks the European Commission to present legislative proposals aimed at achieving this objective, making the concerns expressed in the opinions of the legal commission and for the internal market and the commission for the freedom and rights of citizens, justice and internal affairs.Trinking the consequences from the institution of the Holaf, the two recommendations that we have formulated aim to guarantee its efficiency and operational and legal transparency as well as the protection of individual rights.To this end, a regulatory act is needed - the subject of the first recommendation - which contemplates the figures of crime harmful to the financial interests of the Union and also some addresses of principle.In this regard, the amendment that provides for setting the deadline within which the Commission must present its proposal.The second recommendation concerns the criminal procedure.The Commission - and also here I propose a change as of May 31, 2000 - should present a legal act on the establishment of an independent body, institutionally linked to the Commission, which exercises coordination and control powers on the regularity of the investigation of the Holaf.The Supervisory Committee already in place can only control the independence of the Director of the Office.The proposed act should contemplate an independent status for this new body and to define its functions, limiting them to the internal investigations of Holaf and the criminal action against those who harm the financial interests of the European communities as well as to relations with national authorities.Any influence on the administration of justice in the Member States remains excluded.The supervision of the regularity of the documents should be delegated to the Court of Justice.We also hope that the imminent intergovernmental conference is the debate on the creation of a European authority that can exercise the criminal action to protect the financial interests of the Union, possibly on the basis of the study known as Corpus Juris, created by scholars of clear fame and now widely recognized, as well as the feasibility studies published in the meantime.This project is also warm in the second report of the so -called essay Committee.Even the commission, the Barnier and Vitore commissioners, and some Member States are inclined to collect this idea.I therefore ask you, honorable colleagues, a vote in favor of this report, approved by a large majority by the Commission for the budget control.	it
"But in this regard, Mr. President, the Commission and Parliament will need the Council to guarantee the necessary financial allocation to the creation of this European research space.The framework program will no longer be sufficient, it will be necessary to alter it, modifying its basic orientations.It is an immense job, but we count on you.Mr. President, Mr. President in office for the Council, Mr. President of the Commission, honorable colleagues, the president in office spoke of political deficit.I believe that the proposals that you will advance to Lisbon, which will have to allow a synthesis of the famous great economic policy guidelines, of the ""employment"" lines in order to obtain their lines for the European growth and employment policy, have walked in the right direction.It is a tool for the purposes of the decision -making process.Yet those proposals imply some institutional decisions whose weight can only be evaluated in the medium term.It is proposed to strengthen the role of the European Council in the framework of the decision -making process.Our work in this regard is not impactful, and this impact must be weighed in all the decisions that we will take on the occasion of the discussion on the reform of the ""General Affairs"" Council.Furthermore, behind this decision -making process on the European level there is another battle to fight: what each of us will have to launch in their own Member State, because it makes no sense to launch beautiful guidelines on the political level if the debate on the budget in our countries does not take into account those guidelines.To each of us the task of working there.As part of the strategy that you propose, with a decades of objective, how not to rejoice in the ambitious goal that you propose, that is, to stop considering the full employment in the European Union taboo and equip itself with the means necessary for this purpose, with a growth objective set at 3 percent?Yet, beyond that, compared to the objective of an economy of knowledge, Claude Desama before me recalled the role of public services for this goal;For my part, instead I intend to emphasize a training strategy along the entire span of life.For this purpose, concrete objectives are needed, and we know that we will not reach you without baseing every proposal on a true social dialogue: an aspect on which it is necessary to do more.Finally, two words on social cohesion.I am pleased with the insistence with which she spoke about it, because we do not know what to do with a society that barters the progress of innovations with the abandonment of social cohesion.And we do not think that the fight against exclusion can be broken up: it is a global project and the idea of ​​categories-objective can perhaps constitute an intermediate stop, but certainly not the solution to our difficulties on the front of poverty and social exclusion.In fact, we know that for this battle it is necessary to engage, and we know we can count on your determination.In Lisbon we will give you our support for the implementation of new guidelines on the Economic Policy of the Union.Mr. President, as my colleagues I welcome the very clear document presented today by the Portuguese presidency."	it
As a particular observation, I want to thank Mrs. Cederschiöld for having clarified in her document, among other things, the concept of the so -called provisional copies.In the WIPO treaty, no position has been consciously adopted to provisional copies.If these technical copies were included in the field of protection, the exchange of information would be very expensive and complicated for no reason -as is right in this recommendation.It would be as if the mailman had to pay copyright when he takes a book to his recipient.The truly beneficial for culture would be that art and information could be transmitted comfortably and safely, directly from the artist to the user, the consumer.This new framework of action provides, above all, enormous chances of creating and transmitting culture in a way never seen before.It is essential that the interests of all the parties involved be taken into account.This is precisely what this Parliament has tried to take into consideration in its recommendation..(NL) Mr. President, I would like to start congratulating the rapporteur for the work he has done.The commission has the impression that it has worked quickly and concisely.That is important.The commission is now responsible for expressing her gratitude to the rapporteur.I immediately communicate the conclusion of the commission: we agree with the conclusions of the recommendation project.This means, therefore, that the commission agrees with the ratification of Parliament.I would like to highlight the importance of both treaties.The WIPO Treaty in Copyright and the WIPO Treaty on Interpretations or Executions and Phonograms constitute both an advance in the international protection of copyright and related rights and therefore will mean a substantial improvement of Bern and Rome's treaties.Standos treated will contribute to a high level of works protection and other things, but also offer the public access to content through electronic networks.The two treaties explicitly allow the community to become a contracting part and that it performs an important task in the management of this area.Therefore, it is of great importance that the treaties be approved because it follows that the community gives much importance to intellectual property rights.Approval also leads to greater international recognition of the role of the European Union in the scope of copyright.At the international level, a faster entry of treaties is fervently supported.Now they have been ratified respectively by thirteen and twelve Member States of the WIPO, including the United States.This entry into force depends largely on the European Union, because thirty ratification instruments are needed for the entry into force of the treaties, and these instruments that must be signed by the European Union and the Member States plus the associated countries are of great importance to achieve this number.There are also many developing countries that expect the European Union to ratify them rapidly, since this would constitute a good sign for the entire world.	es
Finally, the report insists on actions in favor of ethnic or social minorities.We can only express our reprobation for a minority policy that would end up proving to be dangerous for social cohesion.On the one hand, it encourages the integration of immigrants where instead it would be favored its assimilation to the culture of the country of reception to avoid the appearance of ethnic ghettos that would create as many urban powers.On the other, it makes use of the principle of positive discrimination, a politically correct chimera as harmful, as the American previous one has shown.For all these reasons, the French delegation of the UEN group was unable to approve the report of the honorable McCarthy.Report Decourrière (A5-0028/2000) Mr. President, the Interreg program is particularly close to us.Just as numerous colleagues I am pleased that the European Parliament has managed to keep the Interreg initiative.I who personally reside in the Belgian region of the Sarre-Lor-Lux Sud I know that it is there that Europe is created, that Europe is lived in everyday life and that, in fact, the citizen fully participates in the European construction.These projects should be taken into consideration and must already be part of sustainable development.Why do I insist on this point?Simply because the projects currently presented are too often still destructive of the environment, precisely for the way they are presented.For example, accepting the construction of new roads is equivalent to accepting new forms of pollution within the European Union and this is completely contrary to the policies that we propose on the fight against greenhouse gas emissions, just to give an example.I also ask that, within the framework of the projects presented, the Vigili Commission on the presence of the environmental pillar of the European Union policy, so that the objective of the reduction, for example, of CO2 can become a pilot value of the proposed projects tomorrow.I think in particular of certain infrastructures under construction.It is known that some Member States have yet to opt for example between the railway and the road for the crossing of vulnerable areas such as the Pyrenees, and I think above all of the Valle d 'aspect;However, I also think of my region, where the state has not yet decided whether to pass the railway, while instead it proposes a second highway, the A32.Also in this case I would ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the cohesion between the various policies, in the case among the interreg programs presented.Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Decourrière report on the Interreg EU initiative, especially for the response that Commissioner Barnier gave to some deputies who intervened and asked that more than the program of the frontier regions whose borders are marked by the sea, and this not only because I was born in a city of the sea, Genoa, but above all, those of the regions of the sea.These boundaries lead us to the States of Africa and the Middle East: we must keep in greater consideration that it is important to also develop the coastal regions of any part of Europe..(FR) as a European deputy from a front -treated region I welcome this third interreg initiative with great interest.	it
It is high time that polluters are starting to pay because, until now, the victims and taxpayers pay.And not only that they pay, but that in addition they clean the affected areas.I therefore welcome the response of Mr. Fischler, especially when he recognizes the need to apply retroactive measures and to provide a quick response to the requests that arise.I want to send on behalf of my group, the socialist group, a message of solidarity to victims, fishermen, aquaculturers and oyster farmers and to industrialists who ensure that seafood occasionally arrive on the markets;to mayors and political leaders, volunteers who have cleaned.We tell them about all our solidarity.I would like to ask two questions to the commissioner.Parliament has adopted a resolution on the application of the principle of polluter pays for this type of case and on the responsibility of the shipowners and owners of the goods.The question I ask the Commissioner is whether we can really apply these principles and if we will receive compensation from these people?The second point concerns the future and publication of the white paper of the Commission on environmental responsibility, the object of which is to guarantee in the future the application of the principle of polluter pays and to improve our ability to enforce European environmental law.This white paper admits that responsibility is only effective if the polluter is identifiable, if the damage can be quantified and if one can establish a clear cause and effect relationship between the two.The sinking of the Erika could not better illustrate this point because it sums up exactly what the white paper intends to tackle.This question would therefore seem to be the best measure to deal with such problems in the future.The proposal for a directive provides for a faultless responsibility for the damage caused by dangerous activities regulated at community level and I wonder -and the commissioner may perhaps answer this question -, if the white paper on environmental responsibility will be able to answer problems such as that of the Erika, if it will really be able to respond to this concern or if, in practice, in the practice of maritime accidents involving ships locatedPollutors will once again escape the obligation to pay compensation to repair the damage they have caused.Mr. President, our sympathies and the expression of our solidarity go to the people and the regions that have been affected by the disaster.But good intentions are not enough, the damage must be compensated and the losses compensated both with regard to the restoration of the environment and the conchyl installations and the fishing tools.We are happy to hear the Commissioner announces the need to act and compensate quickly and in a retroactive manner.We also denounce too lax control of ships and we are in favor of the creation of a European coast guard body, and in particular the requirement of more restrictive regulations and the requirement to have double hull boats.	fr
This must no longer be just a possibility for us, but an imperative.European citizens will not be satisfied with anything less than a quality of life with human beings.We do not want to follow the US model, a model that has absolutely not created the occupation necessary to guarantee an acceptable quality of life.In the United States, the number of poor employed has increased incredibly and this is not what we want in Europe.We have a tradition of solidarity in Europe and we know a better way to do things.But, for this purpose, it is necessary to have the suitable tools, and therefore not only I ask that the group at a high level proposed by the Commission be established, but also that it is further going to a process similar to that of Luxembourg so that you can adopt an integrated approach on the question of social protection.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, this is one of the social problems to which the European Union must give much greater attention.Macroeconomic policies, the stability pact and the nominal convergence criteria have, in fact, hindered an modernization of the social protection that allowed it to help improve the quality of life of populations, in particular with a significant increase in pensions and retirement treatments - especially their minimal levels - and through the fight against social exclusion.The situation presents itself in particularly serious terms in countries such as Portugal, where pensions and minimal retirement treatments are slightly higher than half of the national minimum wage which, in turn, is the lowest of the whole European Union.We will therefore feed very strong doubts about the true position of the commission as well as it will not take charge of the need to review macroeconomic policies in order to create high quality jobs that guarantee all the rights of workers.In fact, these constitute the fundamental prerequisite for the maintenance and modernization of a truly solid public regime.Although the Andersson report has implemented positive proposals, partly containing our signature, some of the principles we criticized in the communication of the Commission remain unchanged.Our concerns remain regarding the modernization strategy of social protection.Mr. President, in the past I directed two manufacturing companies, one in the United Kingdom and one in the Netherlands.As the UK company has grown, we have invested in staff;When, on the other hand, that of the Netherlands grew, we invested in machinery.This choice was dictated by the high social security costs in the Netherlands compared to those of the United Kingdom.I am in favor of the social protection and the original document of the Commission, but I do not want jobs to become too expensive due to the indiscriminate increase in social protection costs.That's why in the Commission I proposed the application of some form of assessment of the economic impact of the directive on companies that take into account costs and risks in terms of employment.The Ppe-de group has supported this amendment.However, I must take note of the fact that other groups, headed by the PSE group and my compatriot, Stephen Hughes, have rejected this amendment.I am sure that the speaker, the honorable Andersson, was animated by the best intentions and respect for the work done, but I believe that the way in which the report defines and promotes the social convergence would cause an increase in social security costs throughout the European Union which would put a large number of jobs at risk and also the credibility of this assembly, demonstrating how far we are from the real world.	it
I believe that with regard to the concrete case of Erika, we are taking action and organizing actions with the French authorities.But what concerns us in the present case is that we should again debate this subject, because the quid of the question are preventive measures.The fishing commissioner reported - and I would like to insist on this - that the Commission will meet and adopt a pack of technical and legal measures.I think it's the way to follow.I would simply like to say that these measures are welcome and that the members of the fishing committee will make very punctual follow-up of these measures so that they no longer be led to meet in this Parliament to deplore facts such as this one.I received, in accordance with article 42, paragraph 2, from the regulation.5 resolution proposals.The debate is closed.The vote will take place at 11 am.CE/Israel Trade Agreement The agenda calls for the oral question (B5-0012/2000) of Ms. Morgantini and others to the Commission, on the irregularities in the application of the CE/Israel trade agreement.In reality, we must debate today a simple thing: respect, application and control of agreements to which the European Union subscribes, compliance with international treaties and standards to which the European Union adheres.It is a simple thing but in this world, it is often the simplest things that pose the most problems.The colleagues who have signed with me the question posed to the Commission want the correct application of the Israeli -I -CE Trade Agreement which - not only do we have reasons to believe it, but we hold, like several Member States, the concrete evidence - is openly violated by Israel.We also have reasons to believe that the Commission is not being held on what should be its basic mission: to be the guardian of community treaties.We are talking about article 38 of the territorial clause which limits the field of application to the territory of the State of Israel and which therefore does not authorize the granting of customs facilities to products from the territories occupied militarily since June 1967 in which, in defiance of all international laws, starting with the fourth Geneva Convention, the successive Israeli governments have implanted coloniesPalestinians their lands and their rivers and installing new inhabitants there.This is not the first time that the Commission and the Parliament have looked into these problems.I will recall only the report of the Commission to the Council and the Parliament presented in May 1998, which stigmatized the Israeli refusal to apply the Protocol of the Original Laws as referred to in article 38. Despite this, the Commission has failed to oblige Israel to respect these agreements and it has provided vague answers to the various questions of parliamentarians, constantly evoking the difficulty ofhas always reminded Israel the legal obligations of the agreement.In order to facilitate the task of the Commission and Member States, an Israeli pacifist movement has published a list of companies installed in the colonies and a Palestinian NGO has gathered and presented to the customs authorities of the various member countries irrefutable evidence on the origin of several products from the occupied territories and marketed in the community.	fr
Obviously it is a positive factor, but it would be in my opinion essential that it referred to the monitoring of the recommendations of the European Parliament as part of our landfill procedure.Do you intend to add this point to the activity of your committee on the advancement of the Audit?Finally, the socialist group agrees with an Activity-based balance and with the need for a responsibility since, as President Prodi said, you will be judged on the basis of your actions and not of the words.As the Mr Morgan said, a crucial factor will be to resume contact with European public opinion, and to achieve this objective you will need facts and not words.I say this with all the respect that I owe to the European Parliament, in which there are real masters of eloquence;We will try to give the good example.As for the excessive bureaucracy, our dilemma has been clearly defined by honorable Morgan.We also detest the mountains of paper, but due to the requirements that we must control, recharge and control once again to ensure effective financial control, the administrative needs that someone defines bureaucracy are inevitable.However, to minimize these obligations, we are not limiting ourselves to discuss them;In the near future we will name a deputy secretary general, an additional deputy secretary general specifically in charge of identifying the best practices and spreading them in the Commission, and also guaranteeing a radical reduction of those procedures that produce paper and bureaucracy.They generate great frustration, not only in citizens and companies of the Union, but also in those who work for the Commission.We will certainly fight to achieve this goal, and I believe that the effects will be felt in the coming years.One of our difficulties, of course, will be due to the fact that the more effective the reform process will be, the less the number of the related information around it will be less;We will therefore have to count on our friends and partners of the European Parliament to illustrate, with their usual generosity, the efforts made by the Commission to adequately serve the people of Europe.I know I will be able to count on you all.The debate on this point has ended.I thank President Prodi and Commissioner Kinnock.Declaration of the high representative for foreign and common security policy, the agenda bears the declaration of the high representative for common foreign policy and security.I wish to address a warm welcome to the high representative Javier Solana who has the faculty of speech.B (eg) lady president, as it can imagine, it is for me an enormous pleasure to return once again before the European Parliament.Ladies deputies, from the last time I came to talk about the aspects related to foreign and security policy on our continent, many things happened.Sometimes too many would think that they have happened.Today I would like to share some ideas with you, concerning basic and common security policy.It is true, as I said, that the world has experienced various changes in recent months and that many events have occurred;However, if you agree, I will answer questions during the time dedicated to this purpose.	it
Within that framework, I would like to underline the approval in May 1999 of a new regime of support for rural development, which constitutes the community framework for a sustainable rural development, and that has been, as its lordships know, one of the evolutions had in the field of negotiation of the 2000 agenda and in the evolution of the treatment of agricultural issues in the community level.Through the European Orientation and Agrarian Guarantee Fund, the Foaga, that community support framework is aimed at helping to invest the tendency to desertification of the rural environment, to which the honor makes, with all reason, reference in his question.On the other hand, the European Rural Development Fund, the FEDER, also contributes within the scope of its mission to the promotion of economic and social cohesion through the corrections of the main regional imbalances and of the participation in the development and in the conversion of rural areas.In this regard, it should be borne in mind that the FEDER also contributes to the promotion of sustainable rural development and the also sustainable creation of jobs in rural areas.The set of these community instruments is the one that allows us to work with a rural development policy that is today, otherwise, one of the developments and the lines of evolution of common agricultural policy, in one of its dimensions, and of regional policy, on the other hand.We believe that within the concept of multifunctionality today linked to the evolution of common agricultural policy, this is one of the fundamental issues and the ugly-Garcia corresponds to it, naturally, a fundamental role.QUESTION Nº 9 FLEATED BY (H-0798/99): Subject: Portuguese agriculture and presidency Can the Council indicate in general what will be the priorities of the Portuguese presidency for the next six months as regards the common agricultural policy, as well as indicating the steps that you judge necessary to increase the confidence of consumers both in the agricultural sector and in the products that have been negatively affected by the alarmcaused by recent health crises?The question that your honor raises regarding common agrarian policy is a question that affects us closely and that is always worth present in the debates of this assembly, because we will probably have much to talk about, in the future, about this issue.During the Portuguese presidency we will have to continue the PAC examination process by adapting some of the common market organizations with a view to a harmonious development of the rural areas of the Union and the guarantee of a positive evolution of the income of the farmers, paying particular attention to the measures that may have repercussions in the small family farm farms.On the other hand, the Portuguese presidency will not leave, naturally, if - and when it is - the new round of the World Trade Organization begins within its presidency, which in no way is safe, to guarantee the consolidation of the presence of community production in international markets and a greater balance between the exported community agricultural products and the preservation of a multifunctional European agriculture, as well as, as well as, as well as, as well as.The Portuguese Presidency will also attribute to the deepening of the Food Security Policy and I consider that the Portuguese Foreign Minister and President of the European Union Council has already referred here, this morning, to that aspect.We believe that the role of food security, particularly in everything related to public health, is a fundamental element that our presidency develops;For the rest, it constitutes one of the priorities of our program.	es
I do not agree with the paragraphs concerning on the Parliament.This report concerns the Commission.Parliament is a separate subject.Nothing justifies the introduction of the Parliament in the discussion on the Commission.There is also the issue of tax purchases.It was an argument against the committee that the lobbies opposed to the abolition of tax -free sales at airports.This subject has nothing to do either in the report.The report mainly concerns financial control.This is reasonable, because it comes from the budget control commission.But it should not be given the impression that vast amounts of European resources are threatened by the negligence of the European Commission.After all, this represents only 1 % of GDP compared to national expenses.We have already discussed it, but some in Parliament are young and do not seem to understand how limited the financial resources of the European Union are and that 80 % of these resources are spent by the Member States.The negligence of the commission in its expenses will therefore not threaten large amounts of money.We should take it into account.It is an element that is important to keep in mind.The action of the European Commission is very limited with regard to expenses.Its role is very limited.Its responsibility is much more important.Responsibility for environmental management, food security, foreign trade, internal market and many other responsibilities that we have entrusted to the Commission without providing it with the resources necessary to assume them.I am not one of those who think there is a cruel lack of confidence.If this is the case, it was us, in Parliament, who created it last year.I have been here for 20 years and I have always noted an absolute confidence between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament.We have had problems, we have identified difficulties, but the citizens of the European Union have never failed in confidence in this bureaucratic commission, they never doubted it or never dreaded it because it managed our affairs badly.This is a great exaggeration of what the difficulties were.This commission should not be forced to live forever in the shadow of the errors which caused the resignation of the commission and which preceded it.When there are problems that we have to solve for enlargement, for example we sometimes insist far too much on their negative side.Mr. President, allow me to thank the rapporteur for the quality of his report.I hope that the Commission will inspire it within the framework of its reform work.The reform process has been underway for some time and apparently reigns a kind of state of emergency within the Commission.It is clear that the way the commission administers business is not particularly good.There is obviously within the committee of capable and competent civil servants;They even represent the majority, but we need radical reforms.There are too few actions and too much bureaucracy.	fr
It is better to pay attention to the requests for modification and improvement of current legislation than launching to formulate new proposals.In this context, support the requests to strengthen the control of the state of the port to guarantee a full and effective inspection.Support the requests that classification societies effectively supervise the structural conditions of ships and consider them responsible for their actions.The requests for improvements in the design of the helmets, in particular that the ships carry double helmet, are successful, but their application throughout the fleet requires time.They cannot replace a periodic and rigorous inspection.Mr. President, I would like to thank my socialist fellow colleagues, fundamentally from the transport and environmental commissions, who have not forgotten that this disaster also affects the fishing sector.Because, in addition to irreparable damage to the environment, the damage to the ecosystem and the losses for the tourism sector, the black tide is a fishing malazo, for the conservation of resources in the marine environment, and long years for the recovery of the damaged coast will be necessary.It is not a coincidence, Mrs. curator, that the affected areas are always those European regions with development delays, those that live badly of the Tourism-Pesca binomial and that do not have, in most cases, of other resources.They are the same, Mrs. curator, who already support the unstrability practices of certain shipowners that clean the funds of their ships in front of their coasts, out of all control.Provide from a region, Galicia, which has suffered in the past similar accidents.Brittany and Galicia, the two European finisters, are permanent victims of the irresponsibility of those who prefer to breach safety standards and transport crude oil in vessels that are in themselves potential black tides.Therefore, I think it is necessary to act in two ways.On the one hand, asking the commission that, within the forestry aids for the fishing sector, arbitrate special measures to alleviate the effects of this catastrophe on the productive sector of the affected areas, and also asking him to demand, the international organizations and to himself, an extreme control of the ships under a convenience flag.In this sense, the current negotiation process for the adhesion of Malta to the European Union must serve to demand that this country rigorously controls the tankers under their pavilion.On the other hand, it is necessary to prevent.Portugal is a country that has mainly demonstrated its sensitivity towards the issues related to the sea.I would ask the Portuguese presidency to study the possibility of implementing a comprehensive strategy for the prevention of maritime accidents at European level, concentrating all the means we already have within our reach - technological, structural and socio -economic - to prevent a catastrophe like this from being repeated in the future.I want, finally, Mr. President, to highlight the work done by the volunteers and the local authorities, who reminded me of old times in which - then mayor - I lived similar situations.	es
This is a transparent and strong way of proceeding, to involve all European institutions and the European population.This White Paper is a response to the challenges that the expansion requires us, expansion that forces us to rethink the functioning of all our institutions, to rethink our own policies - to all our policies - to rethink above all what we must continue to do at the level of union when the member countries will be twenty -five or thirty, what it will be better to do at the level of the individual states, at the level of the regions and at the level of the local administrations.But it is not only the expansion that pushes us to this rethinking: as mentioned above, it is also the same globalization of the economy and politics.We must govern Europe in order to be more efficient, closer to citizens, promoting everyone's participation, first of all starting from the great problem of female participation.One of the great differences in the comparison made in this period between Europe and the United States is not so much the mobility of the work or the problem of risk capital, but rather the participation of the woman in economic life, a participation that in the United States has much more importance compared to Europe.It is a field in which Europe has always been at the forefront: on this we must therefore reflect with depth, with opening, and all the institutions - Commission, Parliament, Council - will have to think of their role, their policies.We will therefore immediately get back to work on this white photographer, even if to complete it we will have to wait for the results of the intergovernmental conference, and therefore it cannot be presented before spring 2001. It will not be a philosophy book, but a concrete book, full of precise proposals.We - the Commission - first we know that we must rethink totally, and for this we will do two things: we will work and we are fully engaged in the internal reform, and we will rethink our policies in depth.I asked all the commissioners - and we will ask for it even more analytical - to identify all the activities that can be abandoned.The Commission must define what its fundamental activities are, those on which it must concentrate, and give in non -essential activities, in order to free new resources and to have a more correct and more cooperative relationship with the individual countries, with the regions and with local communities.We will therefore free new resources, but the moment will also come - I fear, and I want to affirm it here in front of Parliament - in which even these new resources that we are already freeing will not be sufficient to allow us to face our new tasks: I think about expansion, the new sector of justice and internal affairs, the health problems, the problems of the environment.On that day, when we have used all our resources to the maximum, I will not hesitate to present myself in front of you to ask for new resources, but I say to now that if we do not have the necessary resources, we will have to refuse to take any new task because there is no consistency among the new tasks that we take on and the resources we have.	it
"It seems serious that the commission does not address cohesion.It postpones a principle of treaties - that of economic and social cohesion - that must inspire all the policies and all measures of European institutions, seem to ignore that deep arrears persist in several European regions, forget that extension justifies adjustments in regional policy.Without real convergence, what will be risk will be the cohesion of the European Union.Keep the sixth periodic report on the situation of the European Union regions, committed from the Commission.It confirms that, for an average level of development to which grade 100 is attributed, the ten regions designated as ""stronger"" reach the average of 158 and the ten called ""weakest"" are around 50. Give the conclusions about it.50: That is exactly the level of development of the region in which I live -the Azores -one of the qualified ultraperiferic in the treaties.I await the report of the Commission on the ultraperiferic regions that the Council determined to be prepared until December 1999. I term reaffirm my conviction: without economic and social cohesion there will be no type of cohesion, only disintegration.Mrs. President, Mr. President, we need, European public opinion needs, a strong commission, because, as the treaties have wanted it, as the will of the peoples has also wanted, the commission is the engine of European construction, that rock rock that we have to push towards the summit after each expansion.Therefore, strong commission, but that relies on a Parliament, and Parliament is therefore its ally, but an uncomfortable ally, which needs to be heard the messages, and I would like to give one or two in this brief intervention.First, Mr. President, I believe that if your two predecessors have essentially delivered an internal market and install a single currency, you mainly correspond to develop all this citizen value that is in the center of European construction.Indeed, it should not be distracted, whatever its importance, only by the expansion file.It will be necessary to go further, towards the reconciliation of the citizen with Europe and, mainly, those citizens victims of economic, social and, without a doubt, technological fractures.The promotion of scientific development, also the promotion of new technologies and access to these technologies will not be guaranteed by the market and by competition, no more than what the market and competition will ensure the proximity and social efficiency of large collective services, health, education, transport, communications, water and who knows how much more.Its action program, its objectives are discreet, even mute, precisely about the necessary relaunch of public investment.They are also discreet, even mute on the consolidation and financing of large public services and of general interest.There is in that case an absolute priority, Mr. President, if you want to reconcile Europe with the citizen, act so that he chooses Europe instead of Jörg Haider."	es
"First, the Committee for Development and Cooperation would like nothing more than the EEF communality, and it has clearly taken the wrong way.In our opinion, the cooperation is an intergovernmental task, and so it must remain.While Europe is preparing its expansion, the EEF agency would give some the opportunity to simply hide their lack of commitment behind the protective shield of the community budget, apart from the fact that this is the fact that one can give up a fruitful and promising method in this way with which we can participate in our policy of cooperation.And finally, the Commission has recently reminded Maes Maes - rightly reminded of it - what difficulties she has to manage the funds provided by it for her programs for development and humanitarian aid in all transparency.The question arises as to why you should add more programs.Second, we consider it extremely unfortunate that Mr. Corrie's report mentions the deal for trade and development with South Africa, because ultimately this agreement is an example of the unprofessional diplomacy that the European Commission is increasingly operating.We have to find completely amazed that the Union has negotiated an agreement for its Member States, in which an essential part was simply not filled with content.By the way, it is even more incredible that the council has approved this.So we are now in the absurd situation that we have to negotiate from a position of weakness about such important aspects as wine and agricultural production, and this as part of an agreement that has already been signed by us.The part of this agreement, which blocks the negotiations, could have the consequence for the Union that it must compensate for producers so that they hire the production of sherry and port wine.These are a whole range of products that are simply falsified according to international commercial law, and you can imagine the possible costs of such a precedent.This is the proof of this, if this has to be proven at all, that immature diplomacy that does not represent any interests - unless individual interests, trapped between the teaching of faith, the lobbies and the more or less friendly NRO - not only inefficient, but even dangerous.Finally, a word about the general direction of the report Corrie.Nowadays the parity assembly, we do not want to hide this, regarded by the ""theologians"" in Geneva and Washington as an obstacle to international free trade.This could have been an opportunity for us to remind you that our form of an independent and exemplary cooperation with the countries of the south should be further developed and reinforced.The Corrie report has wasted this chance, and to our regret, we have to condemn it that this chance was played in this way.President!As a conclusion and summary, I would like to highlight three essential aspects of this pronunciation.First, and in general, the idea of ​​the idea of ​​the idea is that globalization deepens regional disproportions and social inequalities and enlarges poverty.From this it follows that something has to be done, because otherwise the tensions exacerbate and develop conflicts that pose a danger to peace and stability at the international level.Second, from this point of view, it depends on giving development policy a new dimension by upgrading their role in the correction of disproportions and reducing inequalities."	de
The fact that, as you well know, in Finland the President of the Republic is not only a representative charge but is also the supreme head of the army, increases the historical scope of this event.During the Finnish presidency, a report had been drawn up which described the entire decision -making process in detail;I hope it can act as a reference when it will propose legally binding measures that improve the role of women in the decision -making process.I would invite you all honorable parliamentarians of the right to listen carefully to the intervention of honorable Lulling regarding the need to have fixed quotas as the honorable, more than any other, boasts an indisputable political experience in this regard.Finally I would want to emphasize that this topic should also be treated during the next intergovernmental conference.I therefore invite you to honorable colleagues, not to vote in favor of the proposal in which point 4 is amended, thus allowing the theme of democracy between the sexes is not treated during the intergovernmental conference.Mr. President, lady president of the Council, lady commissioner, despite the progress achieved on the legislative level and the complaints that we periodically express on gender disparities and discrimination, the proposals developed to solve the problem do not eliminate the causes that originate;This means that to guarantee women an equal participation in the decision -making process it is necessary to reform policies in different areas.We know that this is the sector that presents the greatest difficulties both because on women continue to fall back the main responsibilities related to family life and because preconceptions and interests persist that hinder the actual participation of women in the most responsibility sectors.The truth is that the poor participation of women in political representative centers and in the decision -making bodies implies a democratic deficit incompatible with an effective democracy.Therefore it is essential to implement the directives regarding equal opportunities and that I recommend, Commission and each Member State respecting the commitments made decisively, in particular in the context of the Beijing Conference.Mrs. President in office for the Council, Mrs. Commissioner, I am a right deputy, however, I carry on the same battles as my colleagues to support and help the fellow citizens access power and decision -making ganglia - which must be done not only in the political field but also, of course, in all sectors of the company.In summary, I would remember that there are many ways to access it and, if I oppose in particular to the phenomenon of quotas, because I find it particularly contemptuous towards women, I belong to a country where equality has just been established.It is perfectly logical, it is consistent!All this should have been there for a long time because women represent more than half of the company and it seems to me completely normal that they are present, at least 50 percent, if not more, within decision -making powers and in politics.As a result, they are contrary to discriminatory measures to impose women.Women impose themselves because they are pragmatic and with common sense.When I realize that we ask for formations for women in politics, I am tempted to say: absolutely not.	it
In these neighborhoods of our cities often live single -cent families, elderly people who live in retirement and who no longer carry out any production activities, families in a situation of difficulty, when not disintegrating and disarray.They reside in areas that should be able to benefit these projects.If we manage to implement this triple setting, I believe that these families, these people, these European citizens will be able to be more creative throughout Europe, which seems to me very important because, after all, cities will increasingly play a leading role on the European scene.Mr. President, I intend to intervene on the urban and interreg programs on which many speakers have focused.After me the colleagues Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou will be expressed, given that all three are responsible for these community initiatives and we had the opportunity to follow this discussion with great attention.Firstly, I thank the speakers of the parliamentary commissions, of all the commissions, as well as the spokespersons of the groups and all the deputies for the high quality and the profound interest shown in their interventions regarding these two initiatives.This is particularly true for what he said, on Urban, the honorable McCarthy who I wish to thank not only for the work made and for the relationship presented but also, why not say it, as far as we and you owe them for this initiative as well as more generally we owe to your parliament.In fact, I do not forget that in reality it was the European Parliament that took the political decision aimed at maintaining this initiative in favor of the revitalization of urban areas in crisis and a sustainable urban development, also promoting an integrated approach, to which we keep a lot, to at the same time treat the economic, social and environmental aspects.The report of the honorable Arlene McCarthy highlights other points on which we agree and which are: the effectiveness of this tool thanks to the financial concentration and a critical mass for interventions;The horizontal mechanism, which in our opinion is more favorable to the spread of the results and the multiplication of exchanges of experiences and good practices;The growing role of local authorities in the conception and management of programs based on an authentic partnership.Having remembered the fundamental points of agreement between the proposals of the Commission and the Parliament and after underlining the great interest that I tried in listening to the various interventions, I would like to respond to some criticisms and some suggestions, apologizing in advance of not being able to personally mention every speaker.However, I believe that everyone will recognize each other.First of all, as regards the Urban program, I understand that a maximum of 50 cities, by some of you defined as arbitrary, deduced concern.I therefore asked my services to be ready to evaluate a reasonable increase in the number of cities eligible for the Urban Program with certain guarantees primarily on the housing density - I think in particular of intervention areas that must have at least 20,000 inhabitants and exceptionally 10,000 inhabitants - as well as on the financial critical mass: we should stick to 500 euros per inhabitant so that the intervention of the European Union is effective and at the same time being visible and does not disperse in aRain division that would make it incomprehensible for citizens and municipalities.	it
Firstly, the classical ideological deviation, EuroFederalist, a single market, a single VAT, a unique diplomacy, a single army and now a unique criminal right and a unique prosecutor.All this to fight against a fraud of less than one billion euros while they let do you leave dozens of billions for the SPGs, for the free trade areas, for the customs gifts to Chiquita and for the billions lost on the fourth resource, the GDP, due to the austerity pact on the budget.Then there is the Puritan deviation: German Europe of the North, Lutheran Europe, Calvinist, Quaker wants to impose its moral order.After all, the more you let yourself go on the costumes the more the cords of the bag are tightened.- (de) Mr. President, honorable colleagues, today more than ever an effective criminal protection of the financial interests of the European Union imposes itself as indispensable.The scandals of the past related to episodes of fraud and corruption have seriously shaken the trust of European citizens.The credibility of the commitment of the European Parliament to guarantee the correct use of financial resources is linked to double thread for our commitment to the investigations on the past and future prevention.The necessary changes are not only of an administrative nature, but also structural;In other words, we must create the tools designed to guarantee criminal protection for now non -existent.The 2000 intergovernmental conference seems to me the most appropriate location for this debate.Obviously there are also those who argue that criminal and criminal law laws are subjects exquisitely concerning the Member States and that the principle of subsidiarity excludes any other reflection on the matter.It is out of doubt that personally they include me among the advocates of the latter principle, being contrary to any further extension of Europe's supranational skills.Precisely with a view to the requests addressed to the intergovernmental conference, the emphasis must be placed on a clear separation of skills.However, I do not see in this any contradiction with the request to create criminal and criminal procedure, the subject of recommendations 1 and 2 of the report, as it is interests that indisputably concern the whole European Union and which as such do not harm the legal interests of the Member States, but rather promote them at least indirectly.Experts have confirmed compatibility with the various national legal systems, which shows that Europe has a lot in common also in the context of criminal law, for example with regard to the figures of crime concerned.In light of these considerations I consider adequate the creation of such a context as proposed, and the judge of the indeed necessary for the coherent development of Holaf.Mr. President, will a European prosecutor be able to eliminate the scams against Community funds?I don't believe it.Instead, we can obtain substantial results with existing tools.An alternative to the European prosecutor could be Eurojust as proposed in the last European summit.Eurojust, in its architecture, should lead to European and provide support for investigations in the event of criminally relevant crimes.What we need is precisely a practical cooperation of this nature.	it
It is a distant goal, but it can be reached in progressive stages.The most important will be the harmonization of the rights of the States, but for today let's be satisfied with this small step because it goes in the right direction.Mr. President, first of all I wish to congratulate the speaker for his excellent motivation, which indicates some of the serious deficiencies of this proposal.The poor clarity of expression will inevitably give rise to legal uncertainty, while legal certainty is essential in such vital issues.Due to a poor formulation, the agreement can be interpreted in very different ways and ignores the rigorous conditions to which the interception should be subject to the European Convention on Human Rights.Article 18 allows interceptions to another Member State without informing it.Not only would it be necessary to delete this article, but the whole title should be removed.The users of the user who constitute the basis of the current legislation were drawn up on the initiative of the FBI.The proposal of the Council which includes these requirements, Enfopol 98, was approved by Parliament last May with the Schmid relationship.Now we are asked to provide the legal basis for this interception, and it would therefore be appropriate to consider the combination of these two documents.The requirements propose to allow authorities to access all service providers equipment (phones, cell phones, internet);Given the current formulation, very poor, the proposal lends itself to abuse.I would like to ask a question: since the users' requirements specify that the police can access all service providers without any exception, are the internal services of Parliament also include?Are we perhaps approving rules that will allow the police, with very labile reasons, to access our systems?Furthermore, this proposal does not provide for any definition of severe crime, thus favoring any type of abuse.Furthermore, as regards the reversal of the burden of proof, something recognized by fundamental international law, the presumption of innocence is essential, but it is not guaranteed here.Neither the preamble nor the central body of the text take into due consideration the rights of defense, an essential principle of fundamental international rights.The question is very serious;We are very worried about the direction that we are about to undertake without the theme being publicly debated in the context of national parliaments or elsewhere, and without involving the movements of civil rights throughout Europe.They too are anxious for recent developments.Mr. President, I am not part of the legal commission nor I am a jurist but, like almost all the honorable colleagues, I understand how important it is that the European economic space is accompanied by a unique space of justice, freedom and security.In this sense, the issues relating to judicial cooperation regarding criminal law have particular relevance.Reading the texts in question, I came to the conclusion that it is risky to get back to the provisions issued by the Council Fermi remaining the contradictions, the contrasting opinions on what Europe and the different judicial systems that cause not only confusion and ineffectiveness, but also dangerous situations.For example, I refer to article 18, mentioned by certain speakers, pursuant to which any country - or rather, any large country - inventing the technical skills could intercept the communications of another state even without the authorization of the latter.	it
Mr. Provan said that I often talk about tourism and information technology.I am personally convinced that information and communications technologies will play a key innovative role in European tourism.The travel and tourism sector is at the forefront of the use of information and communications technology tools.This will deeply modify his way of operating.Marketing, reservation and transport are expected will be the areas that will undergo the biggest changes and the biggest improvements.The use of these technologies opens up a completely new dimension in the field of travel and tourism.Direct contacts between the consumer and the company will complete, and sometimes will also reduce the current and almost exclusive relationship of business to business.The offer to tourists will be more extensive and better and new products, of better quality, will be created.To do this, according to the Commission, it is necessary to closely link the action in the tourism field to the measures to promote information and communications technology by the tourism industry, in particular by the technological innovation program and the technological program relating to an innovative company, which are both of my competence.The new strategy defined by the Commission of the Tourism and Employment Commission and approved by the Council emphasizes the collection and dissemination of information in terms of tourism and good practices.The implementation of the statistics directive aims to improve knowledge of structures and trends in the European tourism market and the sector concerned.Commission's decisions have advanced the methodological approach.The report on experience acquired in the work accomplished under this directive is part of our work program for the current year.An additional work relating to the social and economic impact of tourism is currently underway in collaboration with international organizations such as the World Tourism Organization.The primary role of the European Community is to ensure a framework that enables the parties concerned and the authorities, at all levels, to optimize and concretize the potential of the tourism sector in terms of growth and employment and encourage them to do so.We will succeed in such a European strategy based on the commitment made by the Member States and the Commission to cooperate in a number of priority areas: exchange and dissemination of information, in particular through new technologies;training to improve skills;quality of tourism products and sustainable development in the tourism sector.In the fall, the Commission will report on the progress made in this regard.In about two years, a report on work to be undertaken jointly with the Member States and the tourism sector should be available.Depending on the results of this work, a broader debate could then be held which could well be the starting point for even more exhaustive political initiatives.Mr. Medina Ortega asked me a few very concrete questions.Regarding the role of tourism policy in the communities concerned, we must understand that many political sectors have a huge impact on the structure of tourism.Specific, targeted tourist actions are not the only ones to import;There are also other horizontal actions in the transport sector.At present, congestion of airways and roads is the fundamental problem.In the field of the environment, we examine methods of cooperation with Ms. Wallström;In the field of regional policy, Mr. Barnier pays great attention to this sector.	fr
Mr. President, I have heard the response of Commissioner Mr. Vitorino and I must state that I am satisfied.It seems to me that your intervention tries to answer the questions contained in the question.I also believe that we must emphasize the importance that, for the European Union and, therefore and from the executive point of view, for the Commission, has the fact of favoring tripartite activities, particularly in regard to the levels of economic-financial and scientific cooperation, in order to ensure that our quantitative presence, in terms of money, can become increasingly a more significant political presence in the next East.I think this is the lesson that we must extract from a situation that comes from afar.With regard to the case at hand, I just heard that Mr. Galeote referred to the visit of our president and Mr. Menéndez del Valle to the visit of President Prodi to Israel and other countries of the Middle East.I consider that both presidents have done well not to include this matter in their agenda: everything must take their place and each level, obviously, they must have their priorities.I think it was a success of the two highest representatives of Parliament and the commission to address the most delicate issues of the peace process that, as we know, continues to find difficulties.We need to fully support this peace process and the attention we pay to those facts denounced in the question of Ms. Morgantini, it is not harmful or harmful attention to one of the parties involved: it is the severity of friends, it is the severity with the friend of Israel's friendly so that these illegalities and irregularities are not repeated, because they harm everyone.From this point of view, this initiative must also be understood positively, as an initiative that wants to favor the peace process in the Middle East.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, Lordship, the current commercial agreement between Israel and the CE is, indeed, confusing.In addition, it is very difficult to determine the origin of the products in question.I maintain, therefore, that it is desirable that it be clarified as soon as possible.However, there are other important factors that we must take into account.After all, we all agree that the relaunch of peace negotiations and not hinder it should be encouraged.At the moment, Israel and the Palestinians have negotiated deeply over their future borders.Each effort of those who try to define, if not impose, the territorial scope of application, also when it comes to a third party, is premature at this time.It seems better to wait for the results regarding the rules of origin of the tripartite work group, which will be created jointly, at the initiative of Israel, the European Commission and also the Palestinians.I am glad that the commissioner also shares my opinion.Hopefully this working group finds a provisional solution for the problem within the current legal framework, without the peace process being endangered.	es
Today, in many states, this is not possible.One of the reasons that explains the difference in competitiveness between European space and, for example, the United States is precisely this ability to bounce back on the other side of the ocean and that we do not know.I believe that, since we have gone as far as that and that we will continue in this path, which is the way to create a collective procedure for regulating this type of uniform litigation in the European Union, we must think of what it does not become the allegorical figure of guillotine.Mr. President, my dear friends, Mr. Commissioner, I believe that if we have so far avoided a certain number of disasters which could have occurred in the absence of the rules that the previous speaker has just mentioned, we owe it more to our skill.When we deal with the internal market, we must worry not only on the most positive side of the project, that is to say the construction of the internal market itself, but also of its reverse, namely bankruptcies.I consider that we live a historic moment.I congratulate the rapporteur for having advanced this work with such a diligence.And moreover, I am proud that my country of origin participated in the development of this provision, which we hope will be quickly adopted by the Council.I think we are preparing to take an important step here, even if its impact on national systems is not very sensitive.Unfortunately, I must inform the rapporteur that our group will not be able to support the amendment proposal 3. We believe that it would have a negative effect on the legal position and protection of citizens.Regarding amendment 6, we presented a similar proposal during the debates in committee, and I am surprised enough that the members of the PSE group did not support it.We intend to vote in favor of this amendment 6 proposal, but I repeat, I wonder why you did not approve the text we had presented in committee.I hope also that we will obtain transparency in this context, as well as a comparison which makes it possible to determine which will be, for our different countries, the best and fastest procedures.Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen, firstly, the Commission would like to emphasize that the proposal for an examination on the exam tonight constitutes only and above all a new formulation of the 1995 insolvency procedure. Everyone knows that the convention in question has been the fruit of long years of debate, often difficult, often laborious and that, in this way, it represents a compromise between the principles of unity and territorialityBetween the structuring principles of various legal systems of bankruptcy in each of our Member States.The fact that we are aware that the evolution of the global economic situation and, above all, of the internal market, can demand the more frequent recourse to bankruptcy procedures, which often put on the nature of cross -border procedures, fully justifies that the Union, as such, has the necessary legal instruments necessary in order to guarantee that the insolvency procedure is executed according to a set of common structuring principles andof rapid execution.	fr
"These two countries are also eligible for financial support under the Meda program (B7-4012).During its first and second readings of the 2000 budget, the European Parliament stressed that the new title ""pre-prédhesion"" (B7-0) proposed by the Commission in the pre-draft budget should not be limited to the associated countries of Central and Eastern Europe, it should also be extended to Malta and Cyprus.However, due to the Refusal of the Council to negotiate the necessary revision of the ceiling fixed in section 7 (pre -prédhesion) of financial prospects, the European Parliament accepted, exceptionally, I insist on this fact, to finance these expenses within the framework of section 4 (external shares) of financial prospects for the year 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament has created a new chapter relating to the ""strategy ofPreadhesion for Mediterranean countries ""(B7-04).Inside this chapter, two new articles concerning the pre -prédhesion strategy for Malta and Cyprus were created, and this awaiting the presentation by the Helsinki European Council - the necessary legal bases, as well as the revision of the ceiling of section 7 of the financial prospects.This settlement proposal should constitute one of these legal bases!I welcome the report of Mr. Brok who supports, for a few amendments, the commission's proposals to prepare the membership of Cyprus and Malta for the EU.The package will grant around a total of 15 million euros for both countries during this year.However, it is regrettable that the Commission has favored an annual allocation of funds to multi -year financing.This decision risks having repercussions on the ability of Malta and Cyprus to plan their expenses.Funding will ensure technical and financial support to enable the two islands to meet the requirements of community acquis.Given their advance compared to other candidates, these countries should not encounter any technical and administrative difficulty for membership of the five -year program.Cederschiöld report (A5-0020/2000).As a member of the Economic and Monetary Commission under the previous legislature, I welcome the adoption of this framework decision to strengthen the protection of our single currency.The Union must implement all the means at its disposal to guarantee its protection against falsification.Indeed, consumers, traders, are not really familiar with the Euro.Memal currency can therefore quite easily be put into circulation in supermarkets, in exchange offices and in banks, without being immediately noticed.As for the coins, the fact that they may have a national side will make them even more difficult to identify.Information centers on Europe, which already play a key role in awareness of citizens with single currency, will have to strengthen the countryside aimed at attracting the attention of the public to the false monk.On another scale, it will be necessary to guarantee cooperation between community institutions and national institutions and set up an information system allowing the collection and exchange of data concerning false monitoring.On the criminal level, measures capable of guaranteeing a game protection of the euro are also necessary.It is in this context that the European Parliament presented the draft decision-making aimed at strengthening the criminal framework for the protection against false monetary."	fr
However, these values ​​are only of full importance if they are part of the contract in a comprehensible detail and ultimately also constitutes legal claims for the individual citizens.Article 6 and 7 of the contract are not enough in the event of the case.In this sense, the Commission - and I would like to confirm and encourage this - to insist on the fact that the newly to be worked out fundamental rights chart becomes part of the contract and creates binding and enforceable rights.In this sense, the Commission must insist on the continuous expansion of the common space of freedom, security and law, and in this sense I contradict my two previous speakers.Only reasonable, feasible and humane principles of immigration and asylum law must be countered by the extreme rights of the irrational, seductive and demagogical claims of the right.But, and I would like to underline that, this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy of employment and against social exclusion, because unemployment, marginalization and growing inequality are an optimal breeding ground for anti -European, nationalistic feeling and acting.In this context, Mr President, I would also like to consider the globalization that you have problematized and its perception through large parts of the population.The feeling of being delivered, the lack of influence and the lack of protection by the state in the best case leads to the avert of politics and to vote, as in European elections, and, in the worst case, to extremist election behavior.Here, like everyone, the Union has not yet understood to offer our citizens of the EU as a means, as a protection against the negative effects of globalization.We are in the process of building a house, but too few of our own citizens also feel at home in this house.Therefore, it is not just a reform of the world trade organization and the economic architecture - and the commission president has clearly forgotten to speak of the reform of the financial institutions of the international financial architecture - but also about trust -building measures for our citizens who are right from the EU and in the EU help and support in the inevitable but painful processes of adaptation to the new global conditions.In this context, it is important what the Commission says about the strengthening voice of Europe.You, Mr. President, spoke of a model that I unfortunately find too little in the document about;They said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, which is clearly different from other models, also from the American model.In this sense, the United States is not only our partners, but also our competitors, not opponents, but competitors, and we have to fight who offers the best model for our citizens.I would like what we said today with this clear vehemence that we also find increasingly in the documents of the Commission.President, Mr President of the Commission, the greatest legacy that its Commission could leave the European Union would be an active contribution to redesigning and redistribution of the increasingly confused and confusing powers and skills of the Commission and possibly the Union itself.	de
The experiences carried out in other sectors in which observers were established also show that, in addition to the creation of jobs of dubious validity, the latter have no particular usefulness.Therefore, the commission to exercise their control functions directly and first person and to work to guarantee the positive trend of leading programs+.This also implies the evaluation and spread of the results, as, moreover, has already been done so far.Mr. President, most of the borders who have divided Europe for centuries have been traced artificially, dividing unitary geographical areas and inducing strong disparities in terms of balanced development and cohesion.Our internal borders, or what remains of it, today are no longer a reason for wars but continue to produce economic backwardness, social barriers and cultural incommunicability among the peoples of Europe.Community institutions have a duty to work so that these scars left by the borders become a memory, since they are contradicted with the spirit of European unity.The economic and social cohesion that we defend is manifested, in the framework of the Interreg initiative, in the form of territorial cohesion and integration of the border spaces and the peripheral areas of our continent.Since the origin, Interreg is the germ of an authentic community policy of the territorial structure, as well as a truly polycentric conception of the European space.While sharing this initiative, the Parliament deploes only that we are requested to approve a resolution in this regard even before we can view the evaluation conducted on Intergeg II;On the other hand, we are aware that it is not good to further delay the implementation of this third edition of the program, which would jeopardize the outcome of numerous projects, or the continuity of those already underway, since Interreg's success can be undeniable as recognized by the local, regional and national and national authorities who participated in co -financed projects.Learning together, innovating, sharing projects and good practices, understanding each other and being tolerant to each other: here are some of the teachings that this initiative has to offer to those who participate.A series of interesting problems revolves around the initiative: the Observatory, the principle of concentration etc.For my part, I would like to dwell on the topic of the management bodies.I consider it necessary to identify common, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities, as well as economic and social subjects, actively participates.The cases of parallel projects along the two sides of a border must no longer repeat themselves.It is necessary to create a cross -border culture, but this requires innovation capacity in the field of administrative cooperation, imagination ability to overcome the existing barriers and the difficulties represented by the different levels of skills envisaged in each Member State, in each region and in each municipality.It is not admissible that a given project cannot be implemented solely due to communication difficulties.On the occasion of the discussion during the commission, we also detected the difficulty represented by the coordination of Interreg with other financial instruments of an annual or biennial nature, such as Meda, Tacis or Phare.The proposed resolution of this Parliament has paid great attention to these difficulties, leaving the European Commission useful ideas to overcome them and establishing reasonable deadlines for the implementation of the necessary changes.	it
"I thank the president, Mrs. Fontaine, who yesterday expressed her position, denialing the involvement of this assembly.In that statement, Mr. President, in addition to disqualifying Nazis to the PNV, Eusko Alkartasuna and the democratic government of the Basque Country, who have an attitude that in another case, Ireland, even deserved the Nobel Prize, representatives of European citizens are insulting -as my case is: I represent a part of Galician society, saying that we are more dangerous than Nazism and it is insulting.Democratic, with dozens of years of history, in an inadmissible madness that I allow myself at this time to condemn.I request, in any case, that our words are heard, because the European Parliament cannot be implied in such a way in a madness that I clearly describe as inadmissible.Thank you, Mr. Nogueira, for your clarification.I remember that the issues on the minutes must refer to the minutes. In any case, for colleagues who are not aware of the president's position, I will read the official statement and thus also record in today's minutes: ""On February 17, Mrs. Nicole Fontaine, president of the European Parliament has received, at the request of them, the representatives of the Ermua forum.They were represented.Therefore, I think the question is totally settled.Mr. President, I request a rectification in the minutes on the vote of amendment 5 of the Swoboda report.I beg you note that Messrs. Michel Raymond, Jean Saint-Josse and I voted against said amendment.Note is taken and thus will be recorded in the act. Mr. President, not to be directly recorded in the minutes, but for a communication that we have today on the table, namely that the Conference of Presidents that was scheduled for February 23 has been annulled.We must reflect on whether these types of acts must continue to be held in this way.I have the feeling that it is nothing more than a mechanical part of the fulfillment of duty.What we hear there could calmly read it the next day in the newspapers.And when something else arises, it does not seem good that the agenda of the different commissions, already excessively loaded, is always shortened because of the show we organize.Therefore, let's do the favor of reflecting if we should not eliminate these conferences once and for all.Mr. Bösch, I take note of his observation but, obviously, the celebration of such conferences of presidents open to all deputies has their origin in a request of the deputies, in order to participate in some of them.We should be more selective.In any case, the table will consider its suggestion.(The act is approved) Voting Mr. President, we ask that the last sentence of the amendment 2 that says: ""Also invite the Member States to promote tourism in the elderly"" is put in and included in section 25, specifically aimed at social tourism, at the end of the phrase ""tourism for organized social groups""."	es
The fundamental discussion point with the Council will obviously be the endowment which Life III must be provided.The common position provides for a financial envelope of 613 million euros for the period 2000-2004, it is insufficient.The Liberal group is favorable to the increase in this amount to 850 million euros.We therefore support the amendment of Ms. Lienemann who notes that the endowment of Life was not increased during the last enlargement of the Union, not to mention the next train of new arrivals.The sums we ask for do not constitute by a Himalayas of unnecessary expenses.On the contrary, they are still very modest in relation to the needs to be covered.A drop of water - I would say - compared to the structural policies of Europe.The environment remains a very poor parent of the European budget, even though it constitutes above all an investment.Investment in natural resources, of course, but also in employment, since it has been shown that an active environment policy created new workstations, for proof in particular the very great success of LIFE: success with NGOs, companies, local authorities, third countries.Nearly a third of the 8,500 requests received met the required conditions and approximately 1,300 projects could be co -financed between 1992 and 1998. A success that Parliament wants to see, intends to see permanent, which is why we also support the amendment 14 sketching the fourth stage of life of the Life project.When it comes to environment, investment and ambition are available, must be available in the long term.The future of future generations is at this price.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, I will probably repeat what my colleagues are said but I believe that, for advice, it is still and still repeating what we think of Life.So, I would also say - as the rapporteur has already done very well - that Life is the only specific financial instrument for the implementation and implementation of the European Union policy.This system is absolutely essential because it promotes truly innovative actions in favor of nature and the environment in Europe, which are taken up and amplified by the Member States.This financial instrument is, moreover, voluntarily democratic by being accessible both to government organizations as to NGOs.It is why, dear colleagues, that I will ask you not to vote the amendments that have understood nothing in the spirit of Life.Indeed, through associations, Life is directly usable by the European citizen, and for the benefit of actions of general interest.Several million - I have said millions - of NGO members recognize in Life the will of the Union to build an ambitious policy in favor of the natural heritage.Life is, moreover, the fundamental instrument of the Natura 2000 network in Europe for which the Member States have invested, in accordance with the community guidelines on rare and threatened flora and fauna habitats and on migratory birds, and which allows the implementation of the protection of high -value biological sites in our states.	fr
We have to make sure to give meaning to what we do.We must not create confusion or arouse conflicts of jurisdiction about rights, which would be highly harmful to freedom, justice and security.In short, we must set up and observe the highest possible standards possible, and find the means to save them.But we must also always have subsidiarity to the mind.Like everyone in this assembly, I aspire to this space of freedom, justice and security, but I do not want it to lead to excessive centralization, chaos and confusion.Madam President, honorable deputies, several questions were asked about the Portuguese presidency in previous interventions.The President of the Parliament made us feel that we did not have a lot of time, which is why we propose, my colleague of justice and myself, to answer objectively to all the questions that have been asked here.We will do this on the occasion of the meeting of the parliamentary committee in which we will participate next week.(Extended applause) Thank you very much, Minister.The debate is closed.Mr. President, I am delighted with the oral and written response of the Council.Its effectiveness has really been remarkable.I spare a few seconds because I would like to propose to the Council to continue to debate at the next meeting of the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs.We will have the opportunity to comment on these proposals as well as to express our concerns with the Commission.I personally congratulate myself on some of the answers received, for example, those concerning subjects as sensitive as Schengen or the Europol Convention which, we hope, will be reviewed and I am delighted with what the Minister of Justice said, namely that we will try to submit to the jurisdiction of the judiciary.I hope it will be the same with regard to parliamentary control.Gentlemen representatives of the Council, we will submit to this assembly, in a month, a proposal for a resolution.I am sure that, with the good humor that you have shown today, the first thing you will do, in this new climate of mutual agreement, will be to take into account the proposal for resolution that we will submit to you.Question time (advice) The agenda calls the time for questions to the Council (B5-0003/2000).Question No1 of (H-0780/99): Subject: Construction of a nuclear power plant in a region of Turkey with strong seismicity The two earthquakes, of a magnitude greater than 7 on the Richter scale, recently occurred in Turkey arouse the most lively concerns before the will displayed by Turkey to build costly nuclear reactors in Akuyu, while even the excessive energy.The Ataturk dams are exported to third countries and which the EU takes its own resources to contribute to the repair of the damage caused by earthquakes.We are led to think that the Turkish nuclear program, which ignores the dangers incurred by the inhabitants and the ecosystems of the country and the whole of the region, serves as a facade for a strategy arrested by the political authorities of Turkey to acquire the nuclear technology which will allow them to acquire nuclear weapons, insofar as they seek to acquire the same reactors, whichPakistan.	fr
"Mrs. President, today the Commission presents us with its strategic objectives for the five-year period 2000-2005 in the form of an extremely generic document from which all the delicate points have been removed to avoid hitting too much sensitivity.And so in the first part on the new forms of European government, the words federalism or superstated are never read, while this is precisely what is proposed on the horizon when it comes to a strong European institution, which only decentrals the ordinary activities of execution and which carries on a collective vision in an unstcribed set, in which the governments and national parliaments are put in a cauldron with regional administrations and even local companies, as well asAll defined, without a minimum hierarchical structure, and I mention ""participants in European policies"".These ambiguity hide numerous misunderstandings first of our values.In fact, to be democratic is not enough to appeal to democracy.In practice, above all it is necessary to accept that citizens are free to decide on the level that best can guarantee objective conditions for a nearby, loyal and transparent democratic debate, that is, mainly at national level.Instead, all the communication of the Commission is built precisely on the inverse postulate, according to which, on the pretext of defending the peoples better, the margin of autonomous choice should be increasingly limited through new regulations, new integrated policies and new binding legal structures, such as the paper project, wrongly defined by fundamental rights.And I emphasize ""wrongly"" because in reality it will end up reducing these rights.We of the Union group for Europe of the nations cultivate completely different principles: we intend to defend European countries, but also respect the choice of peoples.It is not at all the quadrature of the circle: in fact, it is necessary to get rid of the obsolete federalist patterns of those who continue to be inspired by the memories of Jean Monnet for any idea on the European theme.Conversely, European institutions must be opened towards the modern world, inventing a dynamic of variable geometry that respects nations.This is the great idea about the new government that we would have liked to grasp in his communication, Mr. President.Unfortunately, however, it did not appear.Lady president, Mr. President of the Commission, she claims to build a new Europe, but unfortunately she lacks an essential requirement: trust.In fact, the trust of millions of Europeans cannot be conquered since they have not worthy.And how could you be worthy of it after the scandal of the crazy cow, after the resignation of the shrer commission for corruption?It is your responsibility of the millions of unemployed, the millions of poor people, the precariousness and the growing misery caused by your liberty and liberal policies to the bitter end, of the forced march towards the single currency.You wanted and organized the elimination of internal borders, thus leaving Europe at the mercy of the explosion of crime and insurviousness, as well as the spread of uncontrolled immigration.Today she proposes to give all the decision -making power to a handful of officials, making states, local administrations and non -governmental organizations, all of the rest accumulated in the subjection to Brussels, the mere executors of decisions imposed from above."	it
"The new Commission now recognizes the need for this independence for ex -post checks, is it therefore not logical that it is also worth for preliminary checks?I believe that tomorrow's vote should decisively reiterate this need, already expressed by colleague Theato, which I fully share.Mr. President, a few years ago the previous commission had tried to get to the showdown with the old and rigid structures.This caused strikes and denigration campaigns by unions with a restricted mentality, after which the proposals were abandoned and replaced by a ""soft"" compromise.This was the stupidity of the old commission and then the Parliament was not of any help.Reading the chapter of the Van Hulten relationship dedicated to staff policy, I am afraid that Parliament once again fails to expectations on the decisive points, keeping only weak and devoid of any content speeches.There are too many rights, too many rules and too little space for management.The spine and the teeth are missing.Where is the beef?And I say this to her too, Mr. Commissioner: please, deliver the beef event IF it is British.President Prodi promised a revolution and she too said strong and positive words, but now be careful not to give in to the fundamental points, the most delicate ones!Order in the jungle of funding for the staff!Keep hard on the need for mobility, not as a right, as they say in the relationship, but as a management tool!Make sure that the training also becomes a management tool!It does not accept the request for the report, which provides that temporary agents should be appointed on permanent uses!These are the places that must eventually be made permanent, and not necessarily the current temporary agents who must become permanent officials.Finally, Mr. President, as a member of the Bureau until six months ago, I would like to invite you to treat the matter to the Bureau, so that here to Parliament, in our administration, we meet at least the requirements we impose on others.So far we have not done it, and she must help change things.Mr. President, I would like to thank Mr Van Hulten for his relationship, for which I voted in favor.However, I would like to underline the points on which I find myself in disagreement.I do not share what is reported by the paragraphs relating to Parliament.This report concerns the Commission, and Parliament is a separate topic.There is no need, therefore, that we also talk about Parliament during the discussion on the Commission.There is also the question of the assets that exempt.This was a topic used against the commission by the duty-free lobbies, resentful for the fact that the commission had abolished the duty-free in airports.This is also a topic that should not enter the relationship.Much of the report speaks of financial control, and this is understandable since it comes from the Commission for the budget control.However, we must not give the impression that a large slice of community resources is made at risk from bad management by the European Commission."	it
I am looking forward to the draft for a compromise closure, which we have agreed together with the factions of the GUE, the Greens, the Liberals and the PSE, and in which we ask the Commission to present the parliament to the parliament within six months about the realizability of this tax and also have financial compulsory measures and sanctions against the countries that favor tax paradise or to entertain or maintain control paradise within six months.Check, because the objection is often made, such a tax would be avoided, but this applies to every tax, and if you follow this argument, there would be no taxes today.In addition, the draft decision demands that a position paper by the Commission and the Council should be developed by the IMF's next annual meeting.In my opinion, the European Union must take the initiative here;Furthermore, it must suggest this initiative, as is required in the draft decision, the G7 countries, since it is primarily a political question.If the Union takes the initiative, this would have a certain impulse effect because this debate takes place everywhere, also in the United States and in Japan, and because worldwide efforts are increasingly being felt that express the desire that the world should not be directed by stock exchange brokers, but by the citizens, their parliaments, their governments and their democratic institutions.In my opinion, Europe must perform its tasks as part of this new international regulation, and I am extremely happy that this question is on the agenda of the European structure today in this debate and with this draft decision.Mrs. President!I don't have much to notice in advance on this topic.The Council has not yet dealt with the introduction of a tax for capital movements proposed by Professor Tobin.This is a creative initiative that, as we know, has encountered approval in various sectors worldwide and with several European political groups, but so far there is no proposal and no initiative on this question.Since the Commission is responsible for a possible initiative, the Council can only comment on this topic..(NL) Mrs. President!The Tobin tax is to be collected on income from very short-term foreign exchange transactions.Such transactions, it is argued, would hardly have a reference to the real economy data.This was also emphasized by Mr. Désir.Proponents like Mr. Désir are therefore of the opinion that an internationally introduced tobin tax would in principle contribute to the containment of speculative currency transactions and thus also the price fluctuations, which meant a higher economic assets.Due to the considerable scope of short-term capital movements, even with a very low nominal tobin tax, the tax revenue would be significant.The growing interest in Tobin tax and other international financial sources in the mid-1990s were actually under the basis of non-economic motifs, namely the income to be achieved by this tax on the financing of international public programs at a time when the demand for such funding was increasingly increasing and capital was becoming increasingly difficult.The Commission recently found another interest in a global tax such as the Tobin tax, which is intended to serve to achieve socially acceptable globalization, so to speak.	de
However, there is a point of discord.Given the dimension of the directive, it may be a matter of minor rank, but the discussion focuses on it.It affects the issue of recycling expenses.In this we maintain a position basically different from that expressed in the debates of the Council last year.There the issues of the free character of recycling for the last holder and financing were mixed, and the last headline for the last holder was questioned.In this Parliament we agreed unequivocally in February of last year - and we social democrats support it - that free for the last holder is out of any doubt!But who pays for vehicles that must be eliminated?For us it is clear that, with respect to new vehicles, the manufacturer must do so, as the manufacturer is stimulated to design and build vehicles suitable for recycling.But what about the vehicles that are already on the street?An example: in Great Britain, the Rover company, if you were responsible for all vehicles for scrapping, would respond for 5.8 million vehicles in the European Union and should immediately constitute reservations for 250 million euros to deal with recycling expenses, while a Korean manufacturer that builds similar vehicles, has to book, as a representative of the Deutsche Bank, an ridiculous amount.These are distortions of competition that have nothing to do with the protection of the environment, but only affect the investment capacity and jobs of those who build cars in Europe.Therefore, we propose that a background is constituted with which the recycling expenses of the vehicles for scrapping are being faced, in order to guarantee the fulfillment of the principle of gratuity.I understand that colleagues from other countries in which cars are not built say that manufacturers must pay all costs, and the problem of competition distortions with funds is not interested!But I ask these colleagues to be supportive with the more than two million people who build vehicles in Europe and who make a living with it, so that these jobs can also be guaranteed in the future.I am in favor of imposing strict demands in environmental matters, you already know it for the vehicle oil program and the debate on the maximum values ​​of the exhaust emissions.But, in my opinion, these demands must be the same for everyone!Mr. President, Lord Commissioner, Ladies and Lords Deputies, in my opinion, we need this directive.First, because it clearly collects the objectives of the environment.Secondly, because it can foster recycling, and that is important.Third, because it constitutes a clear procedure to deal with heavy metal pollution.This is also an important aspect.The directive provides a European framework, also for countries that already have a system and that want to continue working with that system.Thus, we must first maintain recycling percentages, because that way, technological renewal is naturally encouraged, in order to find a solution about the way of recycling materials with which we still do not know very well what we are going to do with them.	es
First, the parliament must have unhindered access to all commission documents.On the other hand, we have to quickly find a regulation internally to ensure the confidentiality of sensitive documents.In connection with the procurement of information, I would like to draw the commission aware that the plans available in the draft will provide us with documents.If the concept is correct, it represents an enormous step backwards.It is also not the case that a public institution has a copyright of public documents.In addition, the tasks of all European civil servants must generally be determined so that an official can defend themselves more easily against orders for conscience, which run the ethical principles or legal provisions.If the Court of Auditors signals that a problem does not occur, but two years in a row, the management must be held responsible, which must also be felt in its career planning.After all, of course, better cooperation between the European Court of Auditors and its national counterparts is also required.The parliament calls for the Commission to broadly explain their plans for a reform of their programs for foreign assistance on March 31 of this year.It is no longer acceptable that Europe is an economic power, but we cannot have a political influence, because when it comes to it, we are unable to offer effective support.We cannot accept that the Commission completed a hospital in 1996, in which not a single patient is available to this day.The relief has gained political importance since 1996.It is one of the strongest power instruments that Parliament has and must therefore be used.In all likelihood, we will therefore grant relief tomorrow.However, we do not give up this weapon without putting a time bomb.The relief is only granted for 1999 when the financial irregularities complained by the Court of Auditors have been clarified.This report on relief is of course directed to the Commission.But still the European Parliament has to create order internally.As long as we do not have a statute, we are unbelievable as an engine for the reform package of the Union.The reform of the EU institutions is a basic requirement for the further development of Europe.Only an open and democratic Europe can be powerful and fair.All organs now have to go to work together to create this Europe.Mr. President, the committee for industry, foreign trade, research and energy, has decided to start and create a report on relief for the 1997 financial year, even if we had no specific mandate.We did that because we thought we should start in this parliament as we continue to proceed in the future by ensuring that the European taxpayers are in good hands with us.During the creation of this report, it turned out that there are serious problems in the spending areas that belong to our household.	de
"It therefore seemed essential to fill this gap to reach a high and uniform level of training for security advisers, but also to avoid a disparity between training costs and, consequently, an impact on competition between companies in the Member States.The commission's proposal aims to provide uniform training for security advisers.It delimits the minimal content of exams and defines the tasks of the competent authority as well as the requirements to be fulfilled by examining instances.Our parliament has been favorable to this text.He nevertheless presented several amendments, most of which have been retained in the common position of the Council, in particular with regard to the need to draw up a questionnaire and declarations concerning the authorization of certain documents within the framework ""of the specifications of the examination methods proposed by the examination organization"".I also support the postponement of the date of application of these provisions to three months after the entry into force of the directive for the sake of realism.I will conclude by emphasizing the fact that harmonization of the professional qualification of these advisers will help improve the quality of service in the interest of users, to minimize the risk of accidents that can lead to environmental deterioration as well as serious damage likely to undermine the physical integrity of anyone who can come into contact with dangerous goods.Koch report (A5-0104/1999) I expressed myself last October on the Hatzidakis report on the transport of dangerous goods by railway.The words that I will make today are not far from those I made at the time.They come down to this: I regret that, in an area as crucial as the transport of dangerous goods, we always put back in the next day the adoption of harmonized standards to the detriment of the safety of men and the environment.I will recall that a directive on the reconciliation of the laws of the Member States concerning the transport of dangerous goods by road entered into force on January 1, 1997. This included a certain number of transitional provisions valid until January 1, 1999. It was from this date that we should have pronounced on a proposal from the European Commission aimed at ceasing these derogations.According to the procedure in use, it is the European Standardization Committee (CEN) which proposes the standards in this field, which are then registered in the European agreement relating to the international transport of dangerous goods by road signed in Geneva in 1957 (better known as ADR acronym), which applies throughout Europe and whose provisions serve as the basis for the law applicable in the EU.The CEN has not been able to carry out its work in the allotted time.Consequently, the proposal of the commission that we discuss today aims to modify the directive to solve these short -term problems and not to put an end to the transitional regime as should be the case!This is exactly what happened for the transport of these goods by railway, with this difference: a period had been arrested."	fr
"In this case, the Commission proposes to obtain concrete information from the Irish authorities about the current state of compensation measures and to potential problems in connection with the mechanical elimination of savings grass.We do not consider it appropriate to suggest a suspension of the financing as part of the structural funds.Mr. President, the case mentioned by Ms. McKenna is unfortunately not an isolated case.There are other examples of how EU funds are used in such a way that they have a negative impact on the protected areas set up for scientific reasons.The Commission can imagine that all Member States identify that in cases in which they determine a violation of European environmental guidelines or an incorrect implementation of environmental exams, the ongoing financing is not only exposed, but also replaced by funds, or, in other words, the funds are reclaimed by the Member States.This is the only way to stop such actions in the future..(SV) This is an extremely important question.As you are known to you as a member of the European Parliament, a joint letter from our predecessors in the Commission, rode Bjerregaard and Monika Wulf-Mathies, was written last year, which dealt with the relationship between structural funds, funds from the structural funds and protection according to the Florafaunahabiti Directive.The message of this joint letter is still valid.We cannot distribute money with one hand and bring the countries with the other, where they may be fined.That is why it is important that there is a agreement here.Of course, difficult matters can occur.In my opinion, however, the most important effect is that the countries are superior and, above all, submit their lists of the fields for Natura 2000, so that we have the possibility of sensible surveillance and control.In this regard, there are still defects in Ireland, as with other Member States, but we hope that this pressure will soon show results.Let me underline again that the content of the above.Letter is still valid.It is not possible according to the rules of procedure.You have to speak outside the plenary hall, Ms. MP.Inquiries to Mr. Barnier Inquiry No. 44 of (H-0020/00): concerns: partnership-based relationship and the third GREED for Greece The new regulation 1260/1999 About the Structural Association places special emphasis on the strengthening of the partnership-based relationship and sees the participation of the autonomous self-administration at the level of the regions and municipalities as well as the other responsible stateAuthorities, the social partners and any other relevant responsible provider not only in preparation, but also in the financing, monitoring and evaluation of the interventions.The procedures for the new GRP Greece are, however, the repeated complaints of bodies of municipal self -government, but remained unchanged and do not bring anything for the role of ""partners"".Has the Greek state caused a change in the procedures so that the partnership -based relationship is expanded in particular to the local authorities and other representative committees?What does the improved role of the local authorities look like in the preparation and management of the third GfK and what measures did the commission take to ensure more ""partners"" participation in all procedures as part of the new GfK?"	de
"However, before the start of the debates or during the interruptions of the session, could it not open, in order to enjoy, for free, of that magnificent show that, it seems, is behind you?I perfectly understand that it should be the richness of our debates that illuminates our hemicycle;But we would win if from time to time the sunlight could enter to illuminate our ""bubble"" of democracy.I think it would be very positive that the possibility of opening this curtain was examined.Thank you very much, Lord Oonesta.I appreciate any suggestion that confers a more human dimension to our session hall.I would like to make the following proposal.At the moment we can continue the session leaving the room as it is.Meanwhile I will send if the change poses technical problems.If not, we will do a half -hour test to see what happens when the president is sitting backwards.OICVM.(SV) Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, colleagues, my hope is that today the Parliament is willing to adopt the decision to increase and strengthen the financial market in Europe.As a new member of the European Parliament, I have been very interesting and instructive for having the responsibility of this important issue.I want to thank my colleagues for their willingness to reach agreements, the President and the Chamber for his sensitivity to the complexity of this matter, the commission - especially the commissioner - and the Council for our good relations and, in addition, to the Secretariat of the Commission for its generous work.In the commission there has been great unanimity, except at one point, in which I hope we will also agree.The OICVM issue seems complicated, full of political and technical risks.I think there are those who do not even know what OICVM means.However, allow me to affirm that this issue really concerns European citizens, that is, in the way their savings are handled, to the possibilities of choice offered, to the operation of competition between countries in savings, to security demands by investors and their possibilities to save intelligently for old age.It is about compensating the demands for liberalization to improve the market and obtain greater benefits with the protection and safety of investors.During the 1980s, most European markets experienced considerable liberalization.This was a consequence that, especially national values ​​markets, they developed with great speed for some years.Then the collective investment funds became an alternative to bank savings.In my own country, more than 60 percent of Swedes invest in different funds.Savings in funds, which is based on the wide base of its investments.The capital and values ​​market has continued to develop.The current OICVM directive has been outdated.New types of funds have been introduced in some member countries, which cannot be offered in others."	es
Mr. President, Mr. President of the Council, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I think it cannot be repeated with sufficient frequency and intensity that what the Council has agreed as a agenda for the next intergovernmental conference is politically absolutely unacceptable and add how embarrassing.We are in a historical situation in which we are negotiating with 12 member states or we will initiate negotiations and in the situation in which the joint growth of Europe can come true in a predictable time.But how can the union be expanded if now, that is, before the extension, do not things do well?Therefore, our political group is in favor of the Intergovernmental Conference.It seems irrevocable and urgent and we hope you really throw results that make possible a prompt expansion of the European Union.Mr. President of the Council, my political group has taken note with the satisfaction that the presidency of the Council is not satisfied with the current situation.Therefore, it is sure that the Confederal Group of the European Left European / Left Nordic Green is going to work so that the Union finally does its tasks.It is neither more nor less than the future of Europe and especially of a Europe that citizens understand as their own because they can participate in their configuration and because the concerns, problems and issues that are really moved are really taken seriously by politics.The policy behind closed doors, deliberations in silent cliques, all this has to end once and for all.Therefore, transparency is absolutely necessary.I think that as a presidency of advice, you should take care that the train does not continue to shoot as until now and that people are not left behind in platforms as illiterate in matters of treaties.It seems inalienable not only that everything is done to thoroughly inform citizens about the evolution and results of the Intergovernmental Conference but also should be included much more intensely in the entire reform process.It also seems to us that the politicians who adopt the decisions must finally do something and, once the intergovernmental conference is over, ask citizens and citizens through referendums how their Europe should continue to develop.Thus we would really have a Europe of citizens and a new totally new quality in the democratic legitimation of the Union.I will refer to another central democratic issue.As a member of the Assembly that has just started its work with the Charter of Fundamental Rights, I mean that both of me and my political group is not enough for us a solemn statement of the Charter.What will citizens say if rights are solemnly announced but if they cannot be claimed individually by judicial means?No, I think this would further deepen the credibility crisis of the Union.	es
Madam MP, I ask you all - do not take it as a warning - to approach only strictly community subjects.I know that these are very important subjects in Spain and there are several points of view ... I tell the commissioner thatznar is the president of the Spanish government.You can answer the question.Madam MP, as I heard that you had voice, I hope your voice was strong enough for it to be heard in Madrid, but I understood that what you said was not addressed directly to me.I gave you my answer.I am concerned that the structural funds, and in particular those of objective 1, are allocated where there is a need.We have criteria that apply and we know here, as an indication, what each of the regions of Europe should or could receive.The fact remains - I do not shelter myself, but I am obliged to always refer to the general regulations - which I must discuss with the national authorities of each country and with the government of each country.It is their responsibility to distribute the most objectively and as precisely as possible.I need to know anyway, that's why I told you that I couldn't answer today.As I do not have the answer, I wrote to the Minister of Economy and Finance on December 14.Here, the time comes when I will get impatient for not having received an answer and I will send it to you when I received it.I regret that the commissioner embarked, once again, in an imaginative intervention, and this time exciting.In Spain -I want to remind you of everyone -the problem is not that we are in the electoral period, it is that there are only twenty -five days left before the elections.The commissioner will be delighted to know that these elections will take place in twenty-five days because, after, we will probably no longer ask him this type of question.Yes, I think it is important to say that Andalusia will receive 50 % more in the community framework and that Spain also displays a record in terms of structural funds, which means that the distribution is carried out strictly respecting the application regulations and that it is decentralized through regional development plans and various community support frames.Finally, I would like to ask a concrete question to the Commissioner: do you think that the regulations of the application of the structural funds or the current distribution criteria should be changed to you seem acceptable?I find this debate exciting.I understand that he has a dimension that is not exclusively community.That said, you have to get used to the idea that there are permanent elections in all the countries of the Union.What makes me happy is that basically the structural funds, in Greece, in Spain, are the subject of discussions.Earlier, here, we were talking about citizen debates, public debates.	fr
Unfortunately, more than a year after the presentation of the proposal, the other body of legislative power, the Council, has not yet begun to deal with it.I hope this debate will serve to remind Member States the importance and urgency of this initiative.We recently learned from the Portuguese presidency that is about to begin a serious discussion on this proposal.Even the French presidency, which is about to bring the Portuguese one to use the Portuguese one, seems willing to recognize this dossier the priority importance he deserves.The Commission expresses the sincere hope that Parliament and Council quickly carry out this important dossier which in our opinion constitutes the most effective response for fears aroused by cases such as those of which it was discussed here today.As for the participation of transnational workers, there is some clues that at least in one case the companies have broken the transnational information and consultation agreements that had concluded with their workforce in the European field, or at least it is possible that they have exploited some ambiguity of the current legal and contractual framework.The Commission will contact the competent national authorities to check this point.However, I want to reassure those who fear that their rights on the subject have been injured: the appropriate implementation and compensation tools are at their disposal, in particular by means of the competent jurisdictional requests at national level.The Commission is aware of your request to proceed immediately to a review of the directive on European business committees.As stated in the report that we will approve over the next few weeks, we recognize that the directive allows some escapades.However, my colleague, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, has already reiterated on other occasions that in deciding on the possible and immediate revision of the directive, other considerations will have to be taken into account.First of all, any revision of the directive would have a little immediate effect on the agreements in force, unless you want to suspend the application of the fundamental principle that provides for the respect of the autonomy of the parties involved in the negotiation.Secondly, an immediate revision would greatly complicate the situation for the other dossiers open in this field, such as European corporate statutes and the proposal for consultation and information at national level.The success of these dossiers could greatly facilitate the subsequent review of the European Business Committees Directive and indeed providing, to some extent, a solution to the problems identified.This is why, in this context, it seems more appropriate to proceed with the revision of the directive on European business committees only after the conclusion of these two dossiers, and after having more carefully evaluated the application of the directive.Our action is not limited to the legislative field.To encourage and support dialogue as a fundamental element of a happy adaptation to change, the Commission is also developing the recommendations of Lillehammer's report, with the preparation of a European observatory on industrial changes.We are also working on another starting point offered by that group of experts, that is, the relationship on the management of changes.Finally I would like to face some of the other concerns expressed in the resolution project presented to Parliament.	it
"I would like some changes to the assembly, in particular after the conclusion of the new agreement in May.A greater equality between ACP partners and European members must be ensured and I want us to free ourselves with ""their and us"" syndrome.First of all, I would like to see a parliamentary parliamentary assembly of elected members of the ACP countries and not of ambassadors or government ministers present as delegates.I think this is the new agreement.Second, the new agreement provides for the performance of regional meetings in the six areas concerned, which would allow us to be more specific in our work.Regional assemblies should send reports to the joint assembly.We had a regional discussion in Nassau in the Caribbean and it was an extremely productive experience.We will also keep another in Abuja in West Africa.I want the assembly to stop being only a headquarters of discussions and becomes a laboratory for the improvement of the conditions of all peoples in developing countries.I want more voice to civil society.To do this, however, it is necessary to put an end to the problem of corruption, a problem that must be addressed with the utmost solution.We must reward those nations that strive to respect the rules of good governance.In the same way, we must be stopped with those that are corrupt or whose constitutions do not allow the establishment of the pluralistic governments we requested.I am very satisfied with the result obtained in Zimbabwe.European taxpayers will no longer accept that their taxes are used for fraudulent purposes.A new wind of change must blow through Africa and it is necessary to set new rules and respect them.The joint assembly must play a leading role in controlling respect for the principles of good governance, human rights and democracy in collaboration with the Commission.I believe that the elected delegates ACP and EU are up to the task as equal partners and I ask you to approve the relationship.Mr. President, I would first like to congratulate the Honorable Corrie for the excellent and exhaustive relationship.At the basis of any reflection in the field of development policy must be respecting the rights of man and the fight against poverty.The reduction of resources in the sector of aid to development, in many member countries and in the European Union, is in strident contrast with the intention of fighting against poverty.As for the crucial problem, the funding, in an optical time to the future, must be equipped with the joint assembly of additional resources, which serve to send electoral observers at the request of ACP countries.In the future, the European Union, in defining development projects, must, from one song, orient itself on several fronts and, from the other, better agree on your position with individual states, to work more efficiently and use the funds with greater effectiveness.We can mention the education sector as an example, which deserves and needs particular promotion, in the future, in the ACP countries.The lightning development of the potential of training and technology on the internet has revealed the existence of completely new tools to bring developing countries closer, with their still modest means, to globality, but not to globalization."	it
"The failure must certainly not be blamed on the European Parliament.It is the governments of the Member States that have so much restricted the scope.This poses an almost unsolvable task of the European Parliament.One should make friends with the thought that every opportunity to be taken to make a better legal aid.Paradoxically, I could say: It would be best to speak as little as possible about this report.The more we make it clear that it is only very small steps, the more organized crime rubs their hands, and the more clearly the blatant disability between the organized crime and the acute lack of legal cooperation.I emphasize the Council of Ministers emphatically to finally take note of reality.Above all, he should see that crime is proportional to the codification.The goal is to give the judicial authorities - especially judges and prosecutors, but also the citizens concerned - to give instruments for fighting crime without pronouncing the fundamental rights of defense and the general principles of human rights.Otherwise we only fight the symptoms, but not the causes.I therefore primarily advocate the further harmonization of criminal law in the Member States of the European Union.In my opinion, crime can only be combated in this way across borders.As long as this harmonization is still pending, you should be consistent if you want to enable legal aid.For this purpose, I had submitted an amendment, according to which legal assistance may only be provided if the authorities have initiated a persecution law for actions due to actions that are punishable according to domestic law of the requesting party and according to the Member State requested.Incidentally, I find the content of my amendment application in a change application 43, which also places this cumulative condition.This prerequisite is essential, since in my opinion the legal principle in criminal law ""Nulla Poena Sine Lege"" must be respected.As a result, every request for legal assistance in relation to a act that is hypothetically incorrect in the requested Member State contradicts this legal principle and consequently also to the basic principles of law in the requested Member State.It is therefore extremely important that this cumulative condition is accepted.Finally, I would like to repeat that colleague Di Pietro did a great job in my opinion.He has submitted a report in which all conceivable guarantees are offered for the maintenance of individual human rights and fundamental freedoms in view of the limited possibilities.If we want to convey a greater security of security to the European citizen, we have to strive for justitial cooperation.Mr President, my faction welcomes the fact that an agreement is created in order to put the daily practice of legal aid in criminal matters in rules.With the regulation, the rights and obligations of states or citizens are to be laid down with each other or in the relationship between citizens and the state.The present draft is complex: it deals with agreements between the Member States, but also has far -reaching consequences for the relationship between the citizens and the state authorities."	de
That is the position adopted by the United Nations Secretary General and is an element that must be present, naturally, in our future analysis.There are some hopes regarding the third round of negotiations, given the proposals of plans that are in preparation and in which representatives of the United States and the United Kingdom intervene, in particular in the spheres of security and constitutional structure, which, as expected, will be presented in said round by mediation of the representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, which will occur in a frameApril.For the rest, the Portuguese presidency of the European Union, following the example of what they did previous presidencies, has decided to indicate a representative so that they have contacts with the various interested parties in this regard, who has already contacted them and, in close relationship with the representative of the Secretary General of the United Nations, has been following the works of several rounds.In particular, we intend that the European Union permanently maintain an active attitude in that regard, the more so that there is the circumstance that Cyprus is, as evident, a candidate for adherence to the European Union with a fairly advanced negotiation process, which naturally raises some hopes and determines that the European Union has a role of some relevance in that framework.The orientation that we have been following in that debate and our participation in it has essentially consisted of taking advantage of a climate of appeasement of the tensions created by the conviction, commonly - it seems - shared, that it is necessary to continue negotiating and that the continuation of the negotiations and the maintenance of their rhythm are also, in themselves, elements of hope regarding the conclusion of a final solution.There is also another important element, already cited at the beginning of my statement and related to Türkiye's commitment to contribute to the preparation of the north of the island for adhesion.We consider that we must not only read with some attention, a certain detachment, the conclusions of the European Council of Helsinki, but, in addition, we must observe the availability of the Turkish authorities to contribute to the resolution of that issue.I was in Ankara myself, where I had the opportunity to speak with Prime Minister Bülent Ecevit in that regard, and, although we know the difficulties, the specific sensitivity and the idiosyncrasy of the Turkish approach of that issue, I consider that an window of opportunity opens that it cannot be missing.To do this, you have to combine several factors, one of which has to do - it is not worth hiding - with the dynamics of the relationship between Türkiye and the European Union.That is an essential element for the future of this issue.On the other hand, it seems important to us - also in relation to the way as the European Union addresses the essentials of that issue - that the exchange of information between the commission and the chipriotas of the north of the island is encouraged, without that meaning - it must be clear - any type of official recognition.	es
"When the United States landed in Somalia, from which they had to shamefully restart, it was certainly not to ensure control over oil routes, but it was to restore hope.""Restore Hope"", do you remember?In a nutshell, don't you see that in the name of humanitarian law that today the greatest nefarines are made today?Finally, she told us to use the great means for the management of crises, not to make war of course, but to safeguard peace.But this has always been the argument of the architects of the preventive wars.Can you guarantee that there will be no preventive war against other states, especially those who in their elections will not support the politics decided by the other States of the Union?Mr. High Representative, these are the themes on which our concerns focus.She says she is against the war, but it is certainly not the first belliger who swears him.That God saves us the funeral consequences of the magniloquent principles that she has just exposed to us.Mr. President, obviously the development of a European identity on defense and security does not leave the three new members united to NATO indifferent last year, namely Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary.As countries candidates for adhesion to the European Union, they want to be fully involved in this important initiative since the beginning, since now.However, the Council, brought together in the Helsinki summit at the end of last year, chose not to take into account this hope.Only vague promises of consultation and cooperation have been pronounced in the Finnish capital.I therefore want to ask the high representative, Mr. Solana, to what extent Prague, Warsaw and Budapest are or will be involved in the definition of the European Military Management Plans of the Crisis.The question is even more pressing in the light of the critical attitude taken by the Polish counterpart.In a nutshell, the Polish reserve is as follows: avoid American isolationism and European separatism.The Polish Foreign Minister Bronislav Geremek has logically formulated this position in a more diplomatic way, stating that the construction of a European defense identity cannot go to the detriment of NATO unity.On the contrary, the identity of European defense has to strengthen this last organization.It is a position that we fully share!Minister Geremek is certainly not the only authority among the new NATO members belonging to central-eastern Europe to disagree with respect to the crucial process in progress.His position received the approval of the Czech Minister of Defense who, in the autumn of last year, said: ""The safety of Europe is not divisible. Safety cannot be limited to a small group of countries, while others are forced to assist passively or to perform decisions"".The positions expressed reproduce my question to Mr. Solana.Poland's request is simple: being involved in the decisions that concern her.What is the response of the current Member States of the EU to this legitimate request of the candidate countries?B (eg) Mr. President, I also wish to greet the presence of the high representative and his willingness to answer the questions of the deputies during this second appearance, since in his visit to the month of November - certainly, not for reasons attributable to the high representative Solana B this was not possible, although it is right to recognize that he had taken note of the questions and that he had committed himself to answer the questions formulated by the deputies in the shortest time."	it
It would be very beneficial for Tibet, and to all those who believe in peace and stability in Asia and the Government of the People's Republic of China would also gain a lot in credit if it responded to these attempts to start a dialogue.Question no 31 of (H-0795/99): Subject: Rejection by the Commission of the Code of good administrative conduct in the EU according to the press, the Commission rejected the proposal of the European mediator, Mr. Jacob Söderman, to grant citizens a guarantee of good administrative conduct in the European Union (EU).The Commission itself approved the idea of ​​a code of good administrative conduct, but did not accept the detailed proposal which was made of it.Instead, it has advanced a set of additional indications for a better service.Is this information exact?Why does the Commission act in this way, and how does it explain the difference thus born between discourse and action relating to the reform of the EU administration?Does she believe that this event is compatible with the five-point program decided in September with the European Parliament, and is it ready to present a detailed proposal on a code of good administrative conduct on which Parliament can also decide?The floor is to Mr. Patten, on behalf of the Commission.It seems to me that the information reported by the press to which the honorable deputy has referred is deceptive and approximate.The Commission approved at first reading, in November 1999, a code of good administrative conduct to include in its regulations.At the moment, the Commission consults its staff representatives about the document, a process that will be finalized in the following weeks.The Commission will then adopt the code at second reading.It should be noted that the new commission has given immediate follow -up to the European mediator's decision of July 28, 1999, in its initiative investigation concerning the administrative code of conduct.The Commission would like to emphasize, in particular, that it has taken into account, in the drafting of the code, of all the projects of recommendation of the European mediator.The code will exclusively deal with relations between the administration of the commission and the public.It will be adopted through a decision of the binding commission on the legal level which will be published in the Official Journal of the European Communities.The document was drawn up taking full account of the provisions contained in the project prepared by the European Mediator's office.In accordance with the provisions contained in the treaties, the Commission is itself responsible for establishing its payment.However, it goes without saying that the Commission adheres to the principle of a regular political dialogue with the European Parliament on all aspects of the administrative reform.Mr. President, I would like to thank the Commissioner and ask when these directives will finally come into force.I would point out that they are already going back to 1997. The information reported by the press was misleading.I don't think there is a difference between us and the mediator.	fr
This is the reason why I want to underline some issues that I think the commission must have in the foreground.We have that the commission takes into account the points related to additional.We are unhappy with the fact that these figures seem to have been hidden within the United Kingdom figures.We have that the commission also ensures that there are funds adjusted to the projects.We have this to challenge the United Kingdom government, to ensure that the private sector, which surely constitutes the largest objective of the structural funds, is involved in planning.Finally, we ask that the commission ensure that the money from the structural funds is spent transparently.In this Parliament there are too many things that are not transparent.This is an issue that will favor the friendship of the Commission and Wales.Mr. President, our commission treats these issues from many different points of view, and, first, I will speak from the point of view of the investigation.We consider that it is very positive that the party rapporteur has incorporated into their own conclusions the proposal of our commission on the need that, in the countries included in cohesion, the investigation infrastructure is expanded by summoning the higher schools and other training centers in such a way, that they provide a better service to the inhabitants of the less developed areas and facilitate the permanence of the qualified people in their areas of origin.This is possible by adopting measures by public administrations, and this method of territorial recreation in the location of higher education is, without a doubt, an efficient policy to level development.Another issue to which we wanted to pay our attention, especially from the point of view of industrial policy, is that we would have wanted, when planning the coordination of the cohesion fund and structural funds, the Commission would have taken into account the effects of services, electronic commerce and the use of the Internet.Before poverty and wealth depended on the structures of economic activities.The rich regions were the ones that had the greatest number of jobs in the industrial sector, but today these areas can mean a burden and even be poor, and, in that case, new investments must be made in the sectors called computer production and services production, since it is the sectors of the future.This aspect has not been taken sufficiently by the commission responsible for preparing the report, so, on behalf of the Industry Commission, I call the commission's attention on this matter.Finally, we would have wished, in our quality of the Energy Commission, that the need to subsidize renewable energies with the cohesion fund and with the structural funds, and thus it would have been increased, applying the coordination of both funds, the use of renewable energies, so that the lack of financial resources of the energy program would have been compensated by granting these considerable aids aid through the granting of these considerable aids through the concession of these considerable aids.economic.Mr. President, I would like to express my deep thanks to Mr. Schroedter for his contribution to this issue and for explaining to the colleagues that I am speaking in the name of my colleague, Mr. Floutre, who succeeded him in the Employment and Social Affairs Commission but that unfortunately is sick.	es
Section 3: Mr. President, I think there is a translation error in the Swedish text;It would have been fun that the European left had expressed concern about an eventual increase in tax revenues tax.We voted as we wanted to do it, but there was a translation error in the Swedish text, and I want to record.We know that the commission will soon reform common fishing policy.This proposal for the regulations of the Board is the first of a series that will allow to specify this reform.Fishery data collection and management is essential for good common fishing policy management.These data must be reliable, be elaborated independently and be accepted by all the participants of the sector, the politicians and those responsible for the application of that PPC.The text of the regulation proposal has been amended relatively importantly in the Fisheries Commission.The totality of the deputies of our group has voted in favor of these amendments both in commission and in plenary.The amendment 1 allows to clarify the text significantly.Indeed, collected data should not be used solely to scientific use.Scientists must deal with this data and transmit them to the competent political authorities, responsible for decision making.It is nevertheless essential that the compilation method is carried out scientifically justified.Amendment 2, meanwhile, modifies the initial proposal of the Commission.The commission's proposal, in effect, involves the elaboration of very detailed studies boat by boat and company by company.In addition to the extraordinarily high cost that implies this proposal, the heavy management load could lead to some administrations to put this complexity as a pretext so as not to provide the information in due time, and cause feelings of distrust in professionals in the sector, if they are imposed so heavy supplementary bureaucratic loads.Regarding the second part of the amendment, it is important to count and characterize much better the losses of jobs in the sector.The management of a common fishing policy, must not forget it, must include a social dimension in terms of statistical analysis.The amendment 3 allows to add an important dimension that is the compilation of environmental data.It is possible to measure the especially serious effects that data of this type are not taken into account through, for example, the decision related to the prohibition of Enerly to drift networks, absolutely unjustified from the environmental point of view, since it affects one of the most selective fishing arts that may exist.If this environmental dimension in data management was not integrated, the Commission could unilaterally prohibit its willingness, the use of this or that fishing art.The amendment 4 requires the obligation imposed on scientists to deal with and transmit all the data to the competent authorities, including national and regional authorities, so that they can make their contribution to the decision -making process.	es
If Parliament wants to control effectively, the documents must be available and I would like to know what the Commission plans to do to remedy it.Another word about a posteriori control, the DAS.The Van Hulten report also says it in part: I think it would be good for we assigned encrypted notes by category and by sector as to how the budget is executed.The general impression for the moment is that everything is bad in the budget of Europe.However, we have clearly observed in recent years a tendency to improve in the agricultural sector and a degradation in structural expenditure.Is it possible?I suggest that the Commission set up a deadline for implementing reforms.If we welcome new member states, it is not tolerable that the order does not reign in our own institution.Mr. President, dear colleagues, above all, thank you to my colleague, Mr. Van Hulten.This is his first report in front of the Assembly.This deserves congratulations, although I regret that he did not present his report in his mother tongue.My dear colleagues, this report was difficult to establish and it may happen too late.This is due in my opinion to the bickering between the two large groups sitting in the budget control committee.Let's be honest.The second report of the independent expert committee arrived in September.We are now four months later.Meanwhile, Mr. Van Hulten was overwhelmed with amendments, more than a hundred in the first round.He got back to work and rewritten his report taking into account a large number of suggestions, for still receiving nearly 100 amendments during the second round.This is what explains the too late presentation, I fear, of this excessively detailed and bulky report.In addition, according to my information, the Commission has just approved a report on the reform of the Commission, which will be sent for consultation in the various institutions and therefore also in Parliament, I hope.Mr. Kinnock may be able to lift a corner of the veil this evening about this?Dear Mr. Van Hulten, the group of Greens and Regionalists of the European Free Alliance will support tomorrow in plenary session the amendments that try to further improve this report.This has no sense to resume word for word in your report The many very valid recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts.If tomorrow, we vot against certain amendments or against certain paragraphs, it will certainly not be because of their content but only in order to make your report a more readable synthesis.In any case, it must be clear that my group completely supports the recommendations of the independent expert committee.Anyway, I can't wait to read the document approved today by the Commission.Whatever it is, I'm feverishly waiting for the white paper that is to be released in February.	fr
Mr. President, we are faced with a proposal that tries to incorporate a recommendation of the ICCOT into the community legislation - as has been said, from 1998 - which should be binding since June 1999 and which has come to Parliament only at the end of last year.The legislative laziness of the Commission on some issues should not be surprised if it were not because we are faced with a recommendation issued by one of the major international fishing organizations and which concerns the protection of a seriously threatened resource, tuna.The Mediterranean - in particular some of its areas - constitutes a very important reproduction area for red tuna, of enormous commercial value.For this, the ICCOT recommended that the Adriatic is considered to be closed to fishing and has made the conditions that regulate the capture of specimens of zero ages.As the rapporteur says, both measures are totally and widely motivated and therefore all that remains is to ask for approval.However, I agree with the honorable Gallagher who is forced to express his frustration due to the delay with which the Commission sets its mechanisms in motion and converts the recommendations into the Community legislation.We are still waiting, for example, the proposal for the regulation on the prohibition of importing the red tuna from Honduras and Belize, a recommendation that dates back to 1996. According to news in my possession, it seems that last January the DG for fishing has sent a note to the DG of trade and that the latter has already undertaken the preparatory works.However, four years to make the prohibition of import from countries that notoriously favor the flags of convenience is a completely unacceptable term, Mr. Commissioner.We listened to the explanations given by the Commission to illustrate the long internal process necessary for the transposition of a recommendation and the image that has come to us is that of an exasperating bureaucracy.As for the only advanced proposal to make the procedures relating to the legislation under discussion and by virtue of which the Council and Parliament would be more slender, I would like to express reserves.It is evident, however, that we must find a solution to the problem already in the context of the Commission's report on regional fishing organizations and, in any case, as soon as possible.I don't think someone in this classroom has something to object on the principle of protection of novel.In reality, it is often repeated that one of the general objectives of common fishing policy must be to protect and preserve the living resources of the marine environment.All this is commendable.And there is no doubt that red tuna has enormous importance from an environmental and financial point of view.Since I am an amateur fisherman, I too would like to go back to the 1930s, when the fishermen of the port of Scarborough, in Yorkshire, captured tuna with the line that weighed up to 830 pounds - I don't know what the equivalent in the metric system is.I am therefore favorable to the conclusions of the Combet and the principle of intergovernmental cooperation on environmental issues.I would not like, however, that we were here to discuss and turn our thumbs while Rome burns.Common fishing policy does not work.What has been said about conservation is certainly animated by noble principles, but in reality the system of quotas is bringing us directly to the environmental catastrophe.	it
The European Council of Helsinki had the courage to make some decisions and I believe that, from various points of view, in them have already been taken into account of what, at the opening of my initial intervention, I have defined a glimmer of possibilities.It is not through the exploitation of the tensions that we will obtain in this negotiating phase, which is a delicate phase, concrete results.Indeed, in the perspective of a discreet work, it is a work to support the mission of the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General in this context, which we will have to continue to move.The European Union has had an unequivocal position in this regard, honorable parliamentarians, and it seems useless to want to give a different reading to any phrases that will be able to appear in the speeches of the Council or in any other position.In this classroom we do not beat as far as it is politically correct, we beat for right choices internationally and to support the concrete and coherent positions defined by the Council over time and that the European Commission has also followed with great attention and in a pragmatic way.When, in this period, we hear about the need to involve the community of the northern area of ​​Cyprus in some exchanges of information, in particular in the perspective of a future adhesion of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we must realize that we are trying to find formulas of a practical nature that allow us to overcome the obstacles we meet on the path of a political solution.It is not a question of subterfuge, nor are we trying in any way to create, through practical solutions, a model that configures a political recognition.I believe that in this regard the Council of the European Union has provided clear evidence of the fact that this is not its position.The decisions were made with a great sense of responsibility by the Council.Helsinki's conclusions are, in our opinion, very clear in this sense.The way we confronted each other with the Republic of Cyprus within its process of adhesion to the European Union is something that the same Authorities of Cyprus recognize as extremely positive.It is useless to give or try to give a different interpretation to our intentions.Mr. President, honorable deputies, I would like to express a warm thanks for this debate in which I have warned encouragement and trust and which denotes how the European Parliament widely shares the policy of the Member States and the Commission.I am pleased to provide some requested clarifications.Firstly, regarding columns 4 and 7, the question is very simple: in Berlin, in the framework of the large package of agenda 2000, it was established for the candidate countries of Central and Eastern Europe that started a transformation process, and only for them, a special column, or the notorious column 7. Malta, Cyprus and Turkey were not contemplated there.Mr Schroedter defined this inconsistent situation.He should perhaps contact the Prime Minister then in office, who is not far from her, and ask him reason for this alleged lack of consistency.	it
As far as the Commission is concerned, I hope that he can associate with the compromise achieved in Parliament and aimed above all at guaranteeing this balance.To underline once again this aspect - given the difficulty of the situation - Parliament has now decided, for ease and safety, to enroll the funds for the Equal program, so that at a later time the resources can be convinced.I think it was a right choice.The position of Parliament throughout this procedure is unclear and even the regulation helps to clarify it.Precisely for this reason I think that the registration of the funds was the right choice.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, is an incontrovertible fact that the Interreg initiative contributes to the commitment for the economic and social cohesion of the Union.However, I want to underline the particular importance that Interreg assumes in the Balkan area, in which the political revolutions and war events of recent years have had a significant economic impact on the surrounding countries, and in particular on mine, Greece, the only member state of the Union located in that battered peninsula.For Greece, for other countries neighboring with the Region, Italy and Austria, but also for the whole of Europe, a social and economic reorganization of the Balkans that bring political stability to this area represents a question of primordial importance.To date, some Balkan states have received funding in the field of Phare and Obnova programs, others instead not.In the new programming period, in view of the expansion and taking into account the funding envisaged through new regulations and financial instruments, such as ISPA and Sapard, it seems completely indispensable to adequately coordinate the funding of the three areas of Interreg with the other funding intended for third countries.We therefore greet the related references included in Chapter 7 of the European Commission text on the definition of the General Guidelines of Interreg.The commitment to coordination, and therefore also for the efficiency in programming, must concern all the various programs in equal measure, and if I make this consideration it is because, in the previous period, the Meda program has highlighted some difficulties that will now be overcome, in order to guarantee equal treatment to all third countries participating in the program.Finally, Mr. President, I would not like to leave to remember that in the new definition of the areas of cooperation between States the particular geographical situation of the Mediterranean was not taken into consideration, which would instead have justified the creation of a specific area for the coastal and insular areas.We therefore ask the Commission to pay particular attention to the issue of maritime cooperation and island in a next revision of the definition of the areas.I conclude, Mr. President, remembering that the Union must persist in this type of initiatives aimed at erase the disparities between the regions and to guarantee their harmonious development.And since today Valentine's Day is today, as a former mayor of a provincial city I propose that all of us declare our love towards the regions of Europe, towards those who need this love of ours.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner Fischler, the development of rural areas can and must take into account three problems: the maintenance of jobs, the protection of the territory and, last but not least, the conservation of local culture which is of extreme importance!	it
In these conditions, even the best resolutions will remain requests for principle unable to prevent the great trusts from harming.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, are in favor of an tightening of the rules on the control of the state of landing and on classification companies.However, we must also stick to the facts.The Erika oil tanker had undergone four checks over the past two years.It is therefore not the number of checks, but their intensity that must be guaranteed.In the debates of the past few weeks I have heard: Member States do not have enough funds for controls!It is an argument that I cannot accept.If the Member States decide by mutual agreement with us that 25 percent of ships must be controlled by virtue of the rules on the control of the landing status, then they must also make available the necessary staff!In case of control it is not enough for the inspector to go on board only to see if some fire extinguisher is missing;Tests must also be carried out on materials, because it is clear that the ship in question has broken by excessive effort of the material.Such phenomena can only be ascertained with very in -depth controls.We will have to ensure that the controls of the landing state does not only concern external aspects, but also contemplate evidence on materials.Secondly, I share what was mentioned by the commissioner Mrs., who encourages to continue on this path.If it should be ascertained that one or more classification companies have issued convenience appraisals, these companies must be depended on the list of qualified companies;Only with this deterrent is it possible to prevent others from behaving in the same way.Dear colleague Roth-Behrendt, the Tüv for boats already exists, and it is precisely the classification companies!They also exist as standard, and you know different ones, as our French colleagues know;But we have to look good which companies do not fulfill the pre -established criteria, and these must be depenged from the list.One last observation: we should clearly say to Malta that, if he wants to join this community, at the time of membership he will have to apply a standard in the registration and control of the State that really responds to the criteria that we have established, because the environment is common to all, it cannot be divided!Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, Erika has wrecked in my part and is always there, with still 20,000 tons of fuel that we do not know what will happen to.He could also have sink elsewhere.He was wrecked at that point by chance, and Britain, from whom I come, must certainly not be apologized if because of the geography is a peninsula, given that it is Brittany that often suffers shipwrecks.Indeed everything, I think of the 26 Indian sailors that we are not talking about and that have been rescued.In this catastrophe there could have been victims and maritime security concerns above all the life of men.Now they left but it is a miracle that have been saved.It starts again as 20 years ago with Amoco, an accident on the north coast, one to the south, one to the west.	it
On the other hand, at European level, one could study various measures to sanitize relations between hotels and tour operators, such as a regulation governing their relations, the promotion of a special bankruptcy fund, etc., in cooperation with representatives of the two sectors.In the past, the Commission had requested quantitative elements concerning the damage suffered by companies and due to bankruptcies, in order to forge an opinion from the European Confederations of Hotel and Restoration and Travel Agencies, Hotrec and ECTAA, as well as to develop and write a settlement that would regulate their relations.Since then, however, no progress has been recorded.It is therefore necessary, Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, to establish measures which would improve the quality and competitiveness of European tourism, but also would ensure, as far as possible, the operation of companies.They also have to aim at the rational use of natural and cultural resources, as well as tourism infrastructure, thus contributing to the sustainable and balanced development of tourism.To conclude, I want to congratulate Mr. Viceconte and, as Cretan, living in a tourist region, I ask you to consider tourism not only as a pleasant vacation but also as a job creator for a Europe that needs it.Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Commissioner, the change of attitude recently adopted by the Commission for tourism has attracted the attention of those who, like me, have followed, in recent years, this important economic activity and its introduction into the community world.Everyone is aware that this is fundamentally due to the close cause and effect relationship between tourism and employment and recognition on the part of the European Union, after the conference which took place on this subject in 1997, of the enormous potential that constitutes tourism activity for employment.This is why the communication of the commission which we debate today is timely, just like, of course, the report of Mr. Viceconte, which contains 34 conclusions among which are 15 requests to the Commission, and for which I congratulate it.In these 15 requests, the Commission is invited to adopt concrete measures and actions without neglecting the environmental aspect and cultural protection, particularly in the ultraperipheral and island regions.Four requests are addressed to the Member States, in particular that concerning the need to coordinate actions with the regional authorities as well as to establish measures favorable to tourist SMEs, particularly on the tax level and that of access to financial instruments in order to promote the creation of jobs in the sectors which use a lot of hand -to -work, such as that of tourism.Finally, we must recognize, once the absence of a legal basis for which many of us aspire in order to have a common tourism policy will be overcome, we will have to show realism and develop a strategy in this field as the Commission underlines, with the help of this Parliament, as for its relationship with employment, in which young people and women, training and quality, as well as the new companyparticular.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, my dear colleagues, I would first like to thank Mr. Viceconte for his report, which makes it possible to draw attention to a sector too often overlooked.	fr
It is insufficient and I am glad that Mr. Barnier has mentioned here an idea that pleases me a lot and that, otherwise, I expressed before the Burgundy press, namely, the constitution of a European civil security reinforced policy.If we want the European citizenship that we want to exist, if we want this mandate to which our president, Mrs. Fontaine, has attributed the approach of the Union and the citizens of Europe, I believe that the urgency must be palpable for our fellow citizens.Thus, I believe that a Civil Security Eurocuerpo, the constitution of authentic blue helmets, present in the places with difficulties, within the union, since we currently do not have an urgent procedure, but also it was, if its need is felt, in Venezuela or in another place, it would be something that we should advocate, so I wish to say to the commissioner Barnier that in me will find an active ally of that idea that I will find an active ally.generous and European.Mr. President, Lord Commissioner, estimated and estimated colleagues, in Europe we are relatively safe from hurricanes, compared to the frequency with other regions of the world.Even so, the storms of the last week of December demonstrated what their consequences can be and that can still cause us great problems.How many have traveled to Strasbourg by car or train could have verified the violence with which the storm blew in Alsace.I want to express, therefore, my condolence to all citizens and regions so seriously punished by the storm, and highlight at the same time in this Chamber the importance of support for said regions and their inhabitants.We all know that other regions of Europe can be equally affected in the future.Now it is necessary to withdraw all the dejected firewood as soon as possible.We all know, in effect, that even more serious disasters can occur if it remains abandoned in the forest for too long.It should also be remembered, for example, that the biver or bark piercing finds in the fallen trees an optimal means for its propagation and to deposit its larvae, which can have subsequent consequences still impossible to evaluate.It is essential, therefore, remove the damaged wood before the warm season arrives.The true scope of the damages suffered in the forestry sector can only be seen within several decades.We all know, in effect, how long it takes for a tree to grow.It is a process of decades, not years.I also want to remember that forestry is not associated, of course, only to the production of wood, but that in some regions it is above all an essential factor for the maintenance of forest reserves.Consequently, I feel very proud to be able to announce that Austrian forest technicians have also offered themselves ... (the president interrupts the speaker) Mr. President, I express my deepest solidarity to all who were affected by the storms.	es
"We also develop another proposal made by this group of expert report ""Managing Change"".I will finish my intervention on the other concerns mentioned in the draft resolution subject to this assembly.With regard to the strengthening of the connection between competition policy and social policy, allow me to remind you that the regulations in matters of merger contain a provision allowing workers' representatives to be heard by the Commission within the framework of the relevant procedure.From a general point of view, the Commission acknowledges that the various bodies must correctly take into account all aspects of this type of operation, including their effects on employment.Thus, for example, the public authorities, and in particular the Commission, have already taken measures through guidelines on national regional aid which came into force on January 1, 2000 and aimed at ensuring that public funding remains associated with beneficiaries of regional aid and, consequently, to investment jobs.To this end, the granting of any regional aid is conditioned on the maintenance of the investment concerned for a minimum period of five years.The same provision was added to the regulations on structural funds.This means that it applies to all investments co -financed by structural funds.Social cohesion and the interaction of actions carried out at community level is at the center of the next summit, which will be held in Lisbon.I know that we will come back to these questions in the future, because we must consider the best way to adapt our actions and reform them to respond to economic and social progress in Europe.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.Mr. Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso, I thought I understood that you had a procedural motion.If it is a personal declaration, would you be ready to wait for the end of the debate?At that time, I will be delighted to give you the floor.Mr. President is a question of public honor for this parliament, not a personal declaration.This morning, the president of the Parliament, Ms. Nicole Fontaine, repeatedly refused to give me the floor while I wanted to intervene for a procedural motion.It is unfortunately not the first time that Madame the President has shown this unacceptable behavior towards me.In doing so, it has violated article 142 of the regulation which stipulates that requests for speech for a reminder of the settlement have priority on any other request for speech.It has also violated article 122 of the regulation which gives the right to all deputies to intervene for a personal fact.In my case, there were observations which refuted the remarks expressed by another deputy, Mr. Vidal-Quadras.This partisan behavior of our president should be condemned very firmly.I will gladly accept his apologies at any time.Thank you for your declaration.We will certainly make sure to inform the president.I can assure you that, as far as I know, the president does not like to interrupt the votes and start a debate.The Assembly therefore liked to continue the votes.But thank you for your comments."	fr
"It will be made up of qualified auditors and its independence must be and will be guaranteed by a new provision which will be added to the financial regulations.The new service will be responsible ahead of me and will be accompanied by an audit monitoring group chaired by my colleague, Ms. Schreyer, whom I am pleased to see in this enclosure this evening.As a budget commissioner, responsibilities already include relations with the Court of Auditors.This audit monitoring group will ensure rigorous and effective monitoring of internal audits.I would like to insist strongly on the fact that the modification of our control systems will in no way signify a relaxation.The proposed modification aims to improve the efficiency of systems, both in terms of contributions and in terms of measured and responsible results.I can also guarantee in Parliament that we do not advance to what is sometimes called a ""big bang"" type approach.The prior visa of financial control for each spending service will only be abandoned if the internal control system of a service turns out to be completely adequate.I am somewhat surprised that paragraph 10 of the draft resolution does not seem to take over the fundamental criticisms of the current centralized financial control function expressed in the two reports of the Committee of Experts.This committee clearly indicated the need to abolish the centralized prior visa.It was also clear on the need to separate the internal audit from financial control.Furthermore, I do not think that paragraph 10 fully reflects the opinion of the Court of Auditors issued in 1997. The Court will of course be able to give its opinion on the proposals to change financial regulations, but it is useful to recall the remarks that Mr. Karlsson made in this enclosure last month: the internal control of the Commission, he said is not vigorous enough to avoid incorrect operations.Thus, the financial controller issued a positive prior visa in most cases of mismanagement or irregularity which was discovered recently.At the same time, the function of the internal audit is not ensured in a coordinated manner by certain bodies, in particular by the financial controller itself, by the finance inspection and by certain units managing general departments.Originally, the centralized prior approval system undoubtedly aimed to ensure vigilance, but with the years, it had the perverse effect to reduce the extent of the feeling of managers in their decision.I don't think there is real disagreement between us in this regard.I deduce from paragraph 10 that the underlying concern for deputies is that there should be a carefully directed transition.This will certainly be what will characterize change, as deputies will be able to read it in the document on the reform strategy.Our objective, that of the Committee, that of the Court of Auditors, is not to abolish financial control, but to get rid of the centralized financial control and to do better.Before going to another area, I would add that we agree with the rapporteur to say that the existing internal audit function must be maintained up to the establishment, in a few months, from the new independent internal audit service."	fr
The Council and the Commission needed two years to submit this proposal.That is why it is absolutely necessary to come to a decision in March.Delaying the matter or even risking damage to the euro would be irresponsible and also a betrayal of the citizens who should use the new, unknown banknotes.Above all, it is expected that the false covers in the countries act outside the euro zone, where the new currency is less aware.That is why the protective measures also include these countries, whose point of view was given great weight.For this reason, the proposal in its observance of the various interests can be described as solidarity and mutuality, which is also mandatory.Now the council has to gather in March and take a decision.Thank you, dear colleagues, that you listened to me.Thanks also to those who contributed to the quick treatment of this question.I am particularly thinking of the PSE parliamentary group.President, dear colleagues!First of all, I would like to congratulate the rapporteur Ms. Charlotte Cederschiöld on this report, who is an excellent starting point for the reinforcement of criminal protection against falsification of money with regard to the introduction of the euro.The euro will be brought into circulation on January 1, 2002 and then becomes one of the world's most important leading currencies.Due to its importance on the world scale, the euro will be exposed to the risk of falsification or falsification to a particularly high degree.In the present draft of a framework decision, a number of minimum regulations are therefore determined, and an attempt is made to harmonize criminal law in this area and to make its implementation more easily and more efficiently.In addition, he stipulates that the criminal protection of the euro is enforced before it is brought into circulation, whereby a legislative gap is closed in some Member States.I would like to expressly support the rapporteur in the fact that it is necessary to expand this criminal protection to the national currencies, which, after being removed from circulation, can also be exchanged.Each Member State must ensure the introduction of effective, expedient and deterrent criminal sanctions for the actions provided for in the draft of the framework decision as a criminal offense.As for the proposal to determine a maximum limit of eight years for prison terms, there will be no problems in relation to my country, which, although a maximum penalty of five years is currently planned in our Criminal Code for Consumer Face Criminal Code, has already signaled a corresponding change.On the other hand, as our rapporteur has already done for the reasons she has already done, I would like to appeal to the few Member States that still have some money stocks.You should resolve them so that you can make a decision in this regard in the short term.President!With this draft of a framework decision, there is a common proposal for a criminal regulation for the first time, which is used in all 15 Member States at the same time.This takes further steps towards the goal of developing and shaping the European Union as a space of freedom, security and law, as has been sought in Tampere.	de
It is evident that the incidence of trembling in the sheep species has been a factor that has contributed to the general problem.I greet the legal basis that has been established and the comprehensive approach of the new provisions that, I hope, will allow to correct this situation.We must guarantee that nothing enters into the food chain or the compound feeds that can cause in the future situations such as those we have already known.No one wants the situation of farmers to be repeated following the EEB.We must introduce the most strict provisions possible and we must ensure that they work.It is of the utmost importance for the producer, as well as for the consumer who restores confidence, and the only means of doing so is to rigorously stop the problem and solve it.The EEB has not disappeared.We can find it in some countries.I do not want to point out any particular country, but many countries currently face problems similar to those we had in the United Kingdom.The problem will remain for some time.We must guarantee that the entire system of identification of the origin and monitoring of the animal from born until it is sacrificed and throughout the food chain is part of said mechanism for restoration of trust.If we are not able to achieve it, we will face enormous problems in the future.Finally, I believe for a long time, because I come from an agricultural environment, that if we had fed the animals properly and if the feed had been made based on the appropriate compounds, the EEB would never have occurred.The person in charge was not at any time the farmer, those who caused this problem were feed producers, and we have the obligation to ensure that it never repeats itself again..(In) Mr. President, I am glad that this opportunity to deal with a subject in which there is good cooperation between Parliament and the Commission, namely the fight against the EET.I would also like to thank Mr. Böge for the work he has done on this matter.It has been considerably advanced on our proposal for the directive of the European Parliament and the Council, in accordance with article 152 of the Treaty, regarding the prevention and control of the tremble.This proposal deals with all the dangers of the EET in all animals and in all phases of the production chain.Today I am here to listen to your opinions on the first step of this process aimed at establishing a really integral community system for the control of these diseases.In the proposal that concerns us, I propose the elimination of all community provisions currently in force regarding the trembling in sheep and goat species, and transfer them to the framework of the directive proposal.Next, detailed provisions would be introduced in said framework.I have been able to know that Parliament welcomes this initiative to formulate a unique text, as follows from its interventions this afternoon.I hope to deal with any other additional improvement that Parliament wishes to suggest within the framework of the legislation proposal, especially after the reference made by Mrs. Roth-Behrendt to your own report and opinion in this regard.	es
Following this singular procedure, Parliament refrains from imputing responsibility for the 1997 provisions where it resides, that is to say with the old commission.It was the 1996 accounts that dropped the old commission and accounts for 1997 are just as overwhelming.There is therefore no reason to grant the discharge.Regarding the decision to close the accounts, we will be able to reflect during the vote and, finally, with regard to the proposal for resolution, we especially insist on the many recommendations which have been made rightly and we will vote for.Mr. President, the discharge decision for the 1997 financial year was postponed because the previous commission had already presented its resignation to the date scheduled for this decision and only managed current affairs.Now, Ms. Van der Laan, to which we should pay tribute to all the work she has accomplished, invites us in her report to be discharged to the Commission for the year 1997. We may wonder why the current commission must receive discharge for the execution of the general budget of the previous commission - Mr. Camre also reported -, all the more since the discharge for the year 96 was refused.But it is so.Since its entry into office, the new commission must assume responsibility for the acts, but also for the shortcomings of the past.As the system of collegial responsibility which prevails within the Commission allows us to make in all and for all three decisions in matters of discharge, namely a grant, a postponement or a refusal, the fact that four commissioners having belonged to the previous commission are again found today in this body has no more impact.This question should have been asked during the inauguration of the new commission.If the Parliament approves this week the proposal made by the Budget Control Commission and grants the discharge, the Commission would however be wrong to consider this decision as a white check.I am in fact of opinion that the third part of Ms. Van der Laan's report, namely the resolution proposal, is the most important.The obligations it contains, taken up under eight different titles, are an integral part of the discharge.It is on its execution that our decision depends.During the discharge for the following financial year - the year 1998 is already on the exam - Parliament will have to check very carefully if it has not congratulated the commission in a somewhat too premature manner.We will have a sidelines from the moment when the commission will present its reform program.The discharge for the 1998 exercise will allow us to know if efficiency, transparency, responsibility as well as an attitude of opening in relation to the discharge authorities prevail.Mr. President, we all know that Parliament has decided to postpone the discharge for the 1997 financial year while waiting to know the internal reform commitments that the new commission would adopt.	fr
For three quarters, these are children under the age of five.This does not depend on deficiencies of food, but rather on what we have talked about several times today, that is, by growing poverty.The safety of food and the protection of biodiversity must be before commercial interests.In my opinion, the patents on living organisms respond to the sole purpose of controlling the world food supply, especially for commercial reasons, and nothing else.In the report that, I hope, the Commission will prepare I would like to see something about women.In any context, not least in development cooperation, women seem completely absent, which does not correspond to reality at all.Mr. President, the discussion conducted today reiterates the strong need to discuss development policy in terms much wider than the mere detection of aid flows.The level of aid is certainly an important aspect and all rich countries, as a whole, should increase it.This should respond, not least, in order to combat poverty, with particular attention to the development potential.On the other hand, the level of aid is only one of the many tools capable of influencing enormously on the development of poor countries.A series of colleagues today highlighted some important areas, in addition to aid, and in which contrasts and contradictions between different fields of intervention arouse enormous concerns.For example, this concerns commercial policy, agricultural policy and fishing policy.Other important areas are naturally represented by the flow of private investments, by the cooperation on research and technology and the way in which the world community manages and finances some global problems, which involve all of us.Among these global problems there are the trend of the climate, biodiversity, health problems, etc.This observation is further confirmed by globalization, that is, by the new economy that is being outlined.In this new economy, the links between different sectors of intervention are increasingly stronger.What we discuss today is partly, in my opinion, the contribution of the union to the debate on the potential and the risks of globalization, on the rules of the game that must exist to ensure adequate opportunities to poor countries.The report, the photograph of the interconnections and the oppositions between the various sectors of intervention requested by the honorable Maij-Wegen is naturally vitally of vital importance.I wonder why the Commission has not done anymore.The commission is new, it must be granted to her, but the absence of this photograph indicates the existence of strong tensions inside.I can only hope that Commissioner Nielson will be able to obtain consensus in future discussions within the Commission.Beyond this type of account, I would also like a more positive analysis, which should be a continuous analysis.In this analysis one should not limit ourselves to verifying the flows of aid, but focusing instead on all the various types of aid and transfers that have an impact on poor countries.I refer to technologies, commercial aspects, cooperation in the field of research etc.	it
AIDS is such a big problem in Africa today that more people die from this disease than in conflicts.I hope the minister will take the time to go into this special point.The USA already have medication, but they are not ready to sell these medications at a price that is affordable for the people of Africa.I would like to ask the minister what he will do in Ethiopia in relation to the emerging location.The country suffers from droughts and misfortunes, and in six months the same problems will occur as a few years ago when thousands of people died during a famine.At the same time, the war between Eritrea and Ethiopia continues unabated;The European armaments industry delivers plenty of weapons, and then we come and deliver the food.Mr. MP, you have to understand that, first of all, I do not agree with the way you interpret my colleague's speech at the meeting of the Committee on Development.There is no contradiction between these points of view, on the contrary.In the program of a presidency, we cannot do something like an exhaustive inventory of all possible and imaginable situations in relation to all major problems, especially in the context of the outdoor relationships, at most in a seizure of megalomania.It would be easy to do something like you understand.You only need to take a flow of development and write down all questions one after the other.We are responsible enough to recognize that we can only accept the questions that we can treat as part of our presidency and within the framework of the possibilities of governments at the council level - and one must always be aware of it.We have to understand that there are limits here in relation to the enforcement options, especially in the national guide programs.The MP has pointed out the problem of Ethiopia, which is included in the framework of the national guidelines, but as you know, there are various measures for AIDS fighting at community level, and in this regard you are right, Mr. MP, probably the United States will also do nothing better.Incidentally, I think that Europe does not have to worry about development aid policy, and for the simple reason because our behavior in this area withstands every comparison with the United States.The MP's question then passed the problem of the negative effects the armor has.This is a problem of further political importance, which is probably the framework of the actual question, but that the Council will of course discuss in the future if it intends to tackle it in a special connection.Is the advice of social problems that cause the EU's food exports below the producer prices in the developing countries?Does the chair intend to do something on this matter?Since the questioner is not present, request No. 13 is obsolete.I would like to thank the incumbent Council President and personally welcome him to the Portuguese government's presidency.Allow me to pronounce my recognition for his eloquence and his well -founded knowledge of European affairs.	de
This situation is generally caused by the Union's economic and social policy.Width sections of the Union emphasize this policy as dangerous and anti -people.Unfortunately, the new guidelines go in the same direction, and nothing indicates that their implementation will change something.President, dear colleagues!Allow me to say a few short words here to emphasize two points that these reports remind us of and those in the idea we have from the Union play an essential strategic role.The first is the relevant and central importance that we still attach to the principle of economic and social cohesion.We express our concern about reports that we can see that the importance of this goal in the commission's views increasingly subsides.We are still of the opinion that the economic and social cohesion is a central goal of the Union.Secondly, I agree with what I have already heard of a colleague about the topic of the islands here, and I would also like to draw attention to the areas in an extremely outskirts.In the future, we would be happy about more courage in the treatment of the topic of the areas in an extremely outskirts, as is the case in the case of my home country for the island groups of the Azores and Madeiras.I take this opportunity to ask whether the Commission can inform us about the reasons why the Commission's report about the areas in extreme outskirts, which has been expected in Parliament for a long time.President!First of all, my thanks to the rapporteur, also for the willing to take up suggestions on our part in the report.Mr. President, my very worshiped ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Commissioner!With the help of guidelines, the Member States should be offered an orientation to achieve the reform goals as part of the programming.However, the commission's requirements in this regard represent their claim to give orientation, but rather represent an offer catalog of possible measures within the framework of the political fields. To give direction and set priorities is their actual sense.I am in conformity with the rapporteur that the commission document unfortunately contains too few recommendations to the member states for administrative references, and underlining claims such as concentration in the event of negotiations on the promotion of a favorable environment for labor -intensive small and medium -sized companies, on a clear objective for alternative sources of financing, including regulations for risk capital and private financing, on operational start aids, including new onesInformation technologies and investments in innovative areas.My special support applies to an amendment to my faction on Section 10, which should ensure an appropriate inclusion of the private sector when planning and implementing the projects.I would be happy, Ms. Schroedter, if you included this change in change, especially from the aspect of subsidiarity in your positive considerations.President, Mr. Commissioner!In the committee for employment and social affairs, we unanimously took the view that the support of the interventions of the structure and cohesion funds in favor of better employment opportunities for the unemployed and equality between men and women is of strategic and priority importance.Unfortunately, the excellent report Schroedter did not consider this idea, although there are numerous evidence of this - we will see this later in the report - how these funds really help the less developed regions to bridge the distance between them and the most developed regions in Europe.	de
To underline this - the situation is a bit complicated of course - the Parliament has put the Equal program, for comfort and security, in the reserve, so that the Parliament is submitted later in how the expense will be carried out.I think that's good.The position of the Parliament in this whole procedure has been a bit confusing.In the regulation the position is not very clear either and that is why that reservation is very positive.Mr. President, Ladies.It is indisputable that the Interreg initiative encourages effort for economic and social cohesion in the European Union.But I want to underline the special importance of the Interreg program for the Balkan region, where political changes and war activity, in recent years, have had serious economic consequences for neighboring countries and especially for my country, Greece, which is the only member country of this tormented peninsula.For Greece, for neighboring countries Italy and Austria, and for all of Europe, the economic and social reconstruction of the Balkans, which will bring them political stability is a issue of vital importance.To this day, the Phare and Obeva programs have financed some of the Balkan countries and others do not.According to the new period of programs, overlooking the extension and taking into account that financing of new resources and financial regulations have been provided, such as ISPA and SAPARD, it is totally essential to coordinate the financing of the three aspects of Interreg with other financing to third countries.Thus, we welcome the references related to chapter 7 of the European Commission's text on the adoption of Interreg orientations.The efforts to coordinate and, consequently, for a greater efficacy of planning, they must equally concern all programs, and I say this because in the Meda program, in the previous legislature, there were some problems that must be overcome to treat all the countries that participate in this program.I would like to end, Mr. President, with the finding that in the new planning of the transnational collaboration areas, the particularity of the Mediterranean has not been taken into account, which would justify the creation of a special area for maritime and insular regions.Thus, we ask the Commission that especially take into account the issue of maritime collaboration and insular in an upcoming review of the planning of the zones.Term, Mr. President, pointing out the need for the European Union to insist on such initiatives that aspire to disappear inequalities between our peripheries and their harmonic development.And, since today is Valentine's Day, as former mayor of a peripheral city, I propose that today we all declare our love for European peripheries, which need it so much.Mr. President, dear Mr. Commissioner, Fischler, the development in rural areas can and has to respond to three approaches, specifically, to the maintenance of jobs, land care and, not ultimately, in the care of local culture, because, in effect, this is important.	es
I will therefore judge on the acts.In the meantime, I approve and encourage this will clearly expressed in your communication.However, two points are essential: the simplification and application of Community law.In 1998 there were 123 referrals from the Court of Justice for non -application or non -transposition and 25 % of environmental matters are not applied or are not transposed.The events of the past few days show us how essential this is.Community law should not remain inappropriate because it is too complex or too tight.The union must not fall into this flaw and, there again, I regret that your communication does not go more in detail.You are realistic that the welfare state will no longer be able to provide the right answers to the problems we encounter and, among other things, unemployed.However, I regret that a clear option has not been advanced.The emphasis should have been placed on the rejection of any assistantship policy and, on the contrary, on the development of the initiative and the responsibility.You do not insist on the aging of our population, this aging which will have fundamental implications on the structure of our society, not only from the economic point of view but also in terms of public health.It is in fact a silent revolution and, from this point of view, I expected more of your communication.Finally, you insist on European research at the curled of our future.However, you do not tell us the means you want to work.The ethical principles are also at the heart of this research.Your communication says nothing about it.Mr. President, you want to better inform citizen.Start by strengthening links with Parliament: we are the representatives of these citizens.Madam President, dear colleagues, we can only agree on the general guidelines of the five -year program and the program for the year 2000, illustrated this morning with such a passion by the Prodi president.In the two documents, the emphasis was placed on the need to define new forms of European government and to implement for this purpose, a new agenda of the Commission, by defining the most immediate priorities in pursuit of the objective of full employment, thanks to a more effective coordination of the economic and social policies of the States and - I allow myself to emphasize - especially nations that participate in the monetary union and that we must be able to constitute the first example of cooperationreinforced.I will limit myself to this purpose to underline the importance of three priority choices, among others, which should inspire, also in the formulation of the action programs of the governments of the countries of the Union, in addition to the Commission agenda, the work of the European Union in the coming months.First, promotion and participation in the definition of common projects for the creation of an integrated network of services in the transport and energy sectors, with the support of the European Investment Bank.Second, adoption, as a binding parameters in the formulation of employment programs in terms of employment, investments to be carried out in different countries and through community projects in the priority sectors of research, innovation and qualification of the human factor.	fr
In the committee, the Commission referred to the fact that it provides to submit a Novel Food Directive in the future.However, this should not be an obstacle to make the alignment in this case, so that there is no legal uncertainty here with different guidelines.Therefore, we assume that you will also accept our amendment to this genetically modified organisms.The fact that the old text still stands in this directive 70/524 has to do with the fact that the seed guideline in 1986 was presented in parliament and that we negotiated with the Commission until 1988, while the report on this Directive 1994 was treated, and obviously the parliament did not allow the genetically modified organisms to have the same importance as I later had a report.Therefore, we believe, Mr. Commissioner Byrne, that the amendments submitted by us are also accepted by you with regard to the legal basis.If this is not the case, we have to reserve the right to transfer this report back into the committee, so that, like us, like we did the Saatgut Directive, to negotiate with you via this sensitive point, whereby I once again indicate that the text that we have now worked out is valid for your and for our legal service as a compromise.So we don't have to negotiate the text again, but we only have to include this text in this directive.I am excited to be commissioner Byrne, what you will say about our suggestions!President!Mr. Commissioner!Is the regulation of the additives in feed a matter of competition or consumer policy?It is a question of competition for the commission and the legal committee.Certainly we have to take into account the competitiveness of the feed industry by harmonizing the regulations for substances approved before and after 1988.An increase in feed prices must be prevented, and therefore the change applications 4 and 5 must be supported by Mr. Doyle.First and foremost, however, how Mr. Graefe zu Baringdorf formulated it in his report is a consumer policy topic.Food security must have an absolute priority in all discussions about animal nutrition.When we speak of the transparency of the food chain, this applies from the pitch fork to the die fork, and consequently consumer protection in animal feeding is consequently starting.Antibiotics, growth promoters and genetically modified organisms, ultimately come into the food chain of humans.As a consequence of the dioxin scandal, it was clear to all of us that we finally had to step out of this dirty corner.The regulation of the additives in animal nutrition is a step in the right direction.According to Article 152 of the EC Treaty, we are obliged to remedy causes for the risk to human health.The emphasis is clearly on causes.Consequently, we have to close the cock to the original sources of pollutants - harmful additives in animal feed.Otherwise, I find, we find the symptoms, but do not combat the causes.The population is particularly critical of the use of GMO.We have to face the growing awareness of the population to GMO and accordingly regulate the use in feed.First, there is an additive made of genetically modified organisms or if it contains such organisms, this additive may only be approved if it is harmless to human health and the environment.	de
Mr President, this initiative is becoming more important as to how the economic and social problems in the cities of Europe intensify and their citizens are increasingly getting the impression that the administration of their city or its quarter is becoming increasingly off.In addition, there is the profound social change due to the expansion of the European Union.We therefore have to endeavor to revive the economic revival and social cohesion of our cities in good time.Coping with these problems is also urgent in view of the great radiation of the cities to the surrounding region and its historical and cultural role.However, the commitment and participation of all citizens as well as the mobilization of the less active social groups and those that are particularly affected by the effects of the economic and social crisis are necessary for the success of this project.At this point we would like to note how important the balanced participation of women or their organizations is to plan and implement the programs as part of the Urban initiative.As a committee for the rights of women and equal opportunities, we also point out that infrastructure measures that make the professional activity of women easier, especially with regard to the compatibility of professional and family obligations, as well as generally institutions that have to fund solidarity between generations that promote social solidarity.The efficient implementation of this initiative could have a multiplier effect, because this may have similar projects to be stimulated at regional and local level.This would make it possible to increase their political importance, because women must finally feel the effects of European politics in a practical way in their daily life.President!In our committee, we welcomed the fact that the Commission proposed the better integration of local communities and ethnic minorities as well as the increase in security and crime prevention as priorities for the Urban program.We considered it necessary in the committee that an economic and social revival of urban areas must go hand in hand with the creation of an atmosphere of tolerance towards minorities, so that measures that are suitable for reducing racism and xenophobia must be an integral part of the programs to be financed within the framework of urban.We have considered an increase in the feeling of security of the citizens, and thus combating everyday crime in urban crime, for a central task in reviving urban areas.Our committee has determined that innovative and efficient fighting and prevention requires differentiated measures at the local level;This includes the inclusion of crime prevention in urban planning, measures to prevent youth crime, the reintegration of criminals and models for effective cooperation between different actors at the local level, e.g.B. police, judiciary or social services.As a committee, we unanimously adopted our recommendation because it was very important for us to continue urban - which was successfully carried out in the past - because we assume that in the European Union we will only be able to realize a peaceful coexistence of all residents of the European Union in the long term.For this reason, such programs are welcome.For the largest of the four community initiatives, namely Interreg III, I would like to point out the concerns of the committee for employment and social affairs.	de
Why didn't the advice informed us of it?Why didn't the Commission informed us of this formal request from Macedonia?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, from a political point of view, the Balkans are not simply a dark Spelonca.Just look at the considerable positive developments that have been recorded in recent years - difficult - in the Republic of Macedonia.The frightening spiral of ethnic violence in the nearby Kosovo has not extended to the Macedonian territory.Paradoxically, even if it is true, the war in the field of Kosovo Polje has had the opposite effect: an evident reduction of the dangerous gap in terms of trust existing between the Macedonian majority and the Albanian minority.In the eyes of the Macedonian majority, the Albanians behaved with great loyalty against the common state during the international explosion of the conflict in Kosovo.In the eyes of the Albanian minority, the Macedonians and the Macedonian state generously acquitted their obligations of neighbors against the Albanian population of Kosovo tortured up to the extreme.This unusual result of the conflict in Kosovo can therefore reason the second internal political birth of the Republic of Macedonia is right.The balanced and commendable relationship of Honorable SwoBoda takes place very concretely to this surprising and happy outcome.In other words, the European Union knows which position to take on Macedonia.It must help this region recently become the place of refuge of numerous refugees to correctly play its role as promoter of the stability pact in the Balkans.Mr President, for eight years I have been dealing with Macedonia, and I allow myself to contradict the honorable Dupuis.What we do is not of hypocrisy: we have reached the right time, and I believe that the Macedonians rejoice.Please don't be so hostile and moderate his statements: I think we should face the question in a more positive perspective.Macedonia was not at war, but has affected the conflict in neighboring countries and sanctions and still continues to undergo the consequences of the sanctions imposed by the right to the adjacent countries.It has greatly affected the flow of refugees during the Kosovo war.Therefore it should also be said that Macedonia has shown a surprising continuity in democratic developments: it is a country that must face, within it, difficult problems of relationships between ethnic groups and solves them with ever better results.I would like to explicitly emphasize that we can congratulate Macedonia for the exemplary legislation on minorities and the way in which he faced the problem and that the involvement achieved of 30 percent of the Albanian population in life and in government and social policy constitutes the assumption of peaceful coexistence in the country.I am satisfied that at the beginning of March it is possible to follow the request formulated in the report of the honorable Swoboda, that is, that also in this country a European delegation is finally established, which we are finally considered as the European Union.I believe that the start of these negotiations on the stabilization and association process constitutes the logical consequence of a fruitful and positive development in the country.	it
"I think the report by colleague Swoboda is excellent and I can fully agree with him.President!I would also like to express my congratulations on his report.It is to be welcomed that so many support the approach he chose.It is about tackling the stability in the region structurally, and that is also the content of the agreement with the Republic of Macedonia, which we treat today.While the actual execution of the stability package still has to be launched, the Commission quickly worked on the development of the new instrument, the stabilization and association agreement.This begins with the contractual stabilization of the countries of the former Yugoslavia.It is about the countries that are not yet an option for a approach.This agreement is actually a kind of ""pre-advance agreement"", but with the perspective of future membership.This integration of countries via active contracts is a very good instrument, provided that the agreements specified in it are energetically implemented so that the hoped -for stabilization also occurs.Macedonia is still a potential powder barrel and, as such, has a story.But it has the ambition to get rid of this image.This requires internal stability.The new government will be addressed and the agreement can be an agenda for reforms, including the direct participation and equality of the Albanian minority.Above all, the country needs peace and quiet to create order inside and to find the way to more prosperity.We, the Social Democrats, appeal to the opposition to behave accordingly.She must support the Macedonia model here.The country also needs and, above all, stability to the outside.What use is inner stability if the environment is unstable?This stability is required in relationships with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.The region must take note that Macedonia exists and will continue to exist.External stability means open borders and regional cooperation.Minorities and majorities have to get space for human and cultural exchange.Macedonia's stability is closely interlinked by development in neighboring countries.The Kosovo problem is known, where the international community is massively present.Apparently the Albania factor is underestimated.According to the Union, the time for a stabilization and association agreement with this country is not yet ripe.But when?The arguments in particular to conclude an agreement with Macedonia and not yet with Albania fulfill us with so much concern that a waiting attitude of the Union towards Albania is really not acceptable.What position does the Commission draw on this question?Yugoslavia is also a weak point in stability and thus represents a threat to a stable Macedonia. We have to wait and see what is happening there.The mood in Belgrade is more difficult to assess every day.However, we support the decision of the council to shift the focus of the sanctions.At least this is finally trying to strengthen the opposition, which prepares for a new round of demonstrations, to strengthen his back.What will the Union continue to do in this direction, should the opposition request be given up for the opposition?"	de
"Secondly, it is clear that the reform will require some new investments in training and technology;Thirdly, it is evident that it will be necessary to start many preparations for the expansion, and these initiatives already affect the availability of resources.On the other hand, taking on new tasks - which certainly the Council and Parliament will ask us to do - we will have to identify the so -called ""negative priorities"" and eliminate them in order to create new spaces.A key feature of the reform will therefore be the introduction of a more rigorous procedure to connect the determination of priorities to the distribution of resources based on a management system based on activities.I would like to underline, however, that while the internal discipline on the determination of the priorities will certainly be introduced by the Commission, it can be truly effective only if the Parliament and the Council will support it and will take an equally rigorous attitude towards the requests submitted to the Commission.The Commission therefore welcomes paragraph 15 of the report Van Hulten.I conclude, Mr. President, thanking the Assembly for the attention given to this intervention, necessarily long, and still leaving the supervisors, to the commission for the budget control and the other commissions that have expressed their opinion.We hope to be able to start working side by side soon with the Parliament to develop the strategic package of reforms and, more important than all, to be able to collaborate with the parliament to develop the application measures that over the years will become necessary for such a complex reform.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12.00.(The session ends at 11.15 pm) Peace process in the Middle East (continuation) The agenda bears the following of the declarations of the Council and the Commission on the peace process in the Middle East.I am very grateful to the Prime Minister for the Declaration in the Middle East formulated this morning at the beginning of the discussion and for having been able to listen to some analyzes carried out by the Minister Gama, just returned from the Region.My only regret is that my commitment to open the European Agency for reconstruction on Monday meant that I could not take part in the trip to the Middle East, even if, as I said previously, but this is another story, the circumstances wanted me to stop me at Monaco airport and could not get to thessaloniki.This is life.I hope that the honorable deputies apologize if I cannot stay until the end of the discussion, as I would do in normal circumstances.The discussion had been set for this morning and on this basis I had decided to meet the visiting delegation from the Balkans tonight.So I hope to be able to count on understanding the classroom on this occasion.I assure you that I do not intend to make it a habit.Like Parliament, I too willingly welcome the efforts made by the United States who relaunched the negotiations between Syria and Israel, despite Syria's decision that said she needed more before resuming the talks, which should have started today.There is reasonable hope that the foundations for a peace agreement in the near future can be laid."	it
"Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, I brought you a gift.Here is a piece of NAFTA sent by an inhabitant of the island of Noirmoutier who writes to me: ""At every tide, the beach is covered with the crude oil from Erika. At every flood, volunteers, military, firefighters remove enormous masses of this black, viscous and dense tar. When we restore the clean beach and when will this accident be fine?""Yes, this Erika accident, like that of the Russian ship in Türkiye, is unacceptable and intolerable in times when high technology is brought to the stars.It is even more unacceptable because it occurred twenty years after the catastrophe of Amoco Cadiz, when instead we had said and repeated many times that it would never be more successful.It is undoubtedly responsibilities of politicians, and therefore ours, to guarantee the safety of maritime transport.We must really guarantee citizens that such a disaster will no longer be repeated.Listening to her, lady commissioner, you feel a little frustrated because those who had already dealt with these issues know that the Commission and Parliament had prepared, in 1992 I believe, a very interesting text that already contained all the proposals contained in the resolution developed today by the Commission for regional policy, transport and tourism.Because it is true that you have to say and repeat it: Erika is a catastrophe too much.For this reason, it is urgent that the European Union undertakes in a drastic review of its directives on maritime transport, to make them more restrictive and set a clear and precise regime of the responsibilities of the owners of the loads.For example, Shell and British Petroleum had refused to make their oil transported to Erika.Why in this case is not the responsibility of the rent that is the total?In your proposals it is also necessary to introduce the obligation of the double hull and the prohibition of degassification at sea.A European body of inspectors must be established so that they can actually and effectively control the state of the ships.Furthermore, it is equally urgent that the European Union is committed to reforming the OMI.In fact, to what purpose to elaborate restrictive directives if most ships then when you plow the oceans do what they want?Finally, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to address a thought moved to all the volunteers, to the friends of nature and the birds who spontaneously and generously respond present and rush to the rescue of the birds impregnated by Nafta by organizing their rescue with the available means.I am a direct witness of this exceptional work.You surely know that about 200,000 birds will die due to the black tide which is an ecological catastrophe of enormous and practically unprecedented ecological catastrophe.Certainly you also know how difficult it is today to keep the species and how difficult it is to keep the habitats.In this regard, Mrs. Commissioner, you have not said anything about the way in which the Commission intends to contribute to the restoration of nature and ecosystems.Once again, there will be no clearly identified managers.In the wait is always the nature that has the worst."	it
We are at the beginning of an era of creation of a new right, in which the right to exploit intellectual property will face the public interest for its dissemination and exploitation by the general public.Mr. President, thanks to the rapporteur for this excellent report that, however, it concludes that our adhesion, as a community, to those two WIPO treaties should not be limited to a simple institutional evolution, no matter how important it is: the possibility for the European Community and the WIPO Assembly of working together.This ratification is also necessary with respect to the expansion of Europe.But behind that community adhesion, an objective is emerging in my opinion still too virtual and yet too offensive for some member states.This is the affirmation of a European cultural policy for which I hope that we, Parliament, Commission and Council, agree.Who refers to cultural policy refers among other things to the defense of the role of creation, to the recognition of the authors and the production of a demanding culture.And even more today, when Europe must endow a new copyright and related policy, they have just underlined several times - define and re -define what an author is.We maintain too much inaccuracy in this regard and from now on new technologies impose that clarification effort.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the signing of the WIPO treaties meant a considerable positive step in the global development of the information society.These treaties crystallize a copyright tradition of decades, and constitute a balanced and very well thought out solution regarding the regulations on the copyright and related rights.However, the entry into force of the treaties and their definitive form will depend on both this recommendation, and on the execution made by the interested parties.The WIPO treaty has already entered into force in the United States with the help of the digital Millenium Corporate Act, a legislative measure that has contributed to conserve the delicate balance of the WIPO treaty.The European Union must also advance in the process of adapting its laws to what was agreed in the WIPO Treaty.It is also worrying that the positions adopted by the preceding Parliament do not support the balanced System of the WIPO Treaty.The opinion approved in the first reading of the directive on copyright was very distorted, and balance, in turn, is being modified in a pernicious direction for Europe.With the recommendations that have been proposed, the position of culture in Europe is not improved, quite the contrary.The modifications proposed by Parliament would be limited to improving the possibilities of communication companies based in the markets to transfer their old installments, exceeding 80 percent, to a new framework through rigid and sized copyright.I do not refer now to the recommendation of Mrs. Charlotte Cederschiöld, which in itself is a great proposal, but to copyright as addressed by the previous Parliament.	es
".(IT) On behalf of the Italian communists, I want to express great dissatisfaction with the contents of the document that, according to expectations, had to formulate the strategic objectives for Europe until 2005. Employment: for years, the link between economic growth and increase in employment does not respond to reality, however, it is proposed again as a recipe - which has been proven useless - to solve the very serious problem of unemployment.And that the president is a seasoned economist.Pensions: The document is said: ""The responsibility for the modernization of social protection systems will continue to correspond to the Member States"";However, precisely the Commission intervened in the case of Italy, repeatedly asking for a rapid modification of the pension regime, aimed at reducing rights and remuneration.And that Mr. President Prodi, for the important orientation he gave to the Italian government in those years, knows how many and what sacrifices our fellow citizens have been requested and made to enter the euro and knows the important role that Italy plays in European development.Therefore, we cannot accept invitations to make greater pension cuts.There is an agreement regarding this issue that provides for its review in 2001. It should not be reviewed a day before or a day later.On the other hand, the dynamics of costs in this regard is totally under control.Therefore, the commission must refrain from this unacceptable ideological approach and these statements that create instability and uncertainty in citizens.I have mentioned the case of Italy not only because the president knows him very well, but because of the community data (Eurostat), it follows that for Italy the welfare expense - currently 25.9% - it is not only since 1990 less than the community average (28.2%), but that it is much lower than the average of the countries considered copies such as Germany (29.9%) and France (30.8%).Role of Europe: First, we must reaffirm that Europe rejects war as an instrument to solve international conflicts;Then you can talk about the ""military"" role of the Union.Agriculture and Health: Our vision of the issue differs from the vision of the Commission: for us there are no consumers, there are citizens who want to nourish themselves with healthy foods, with products whose purpose is not competitiveness, but the health, quality and respect of the environment, elements that, on the other hand, create employment..(FR) The proposals for measures and the program presented by Mr. Prodi are extremely inaccurate, and social issues, once again, are absent.In addition, the word ""social"" seems to be banned from the vocabulary of the commission, while liberal and American references abound.Renano Prodi collects the highly controversial concept of ""good governance"";controversial because it favors leadership against the proper functioning of democracy, and because it refers to the notion defined by the IMF, whose ideological content is totally dominated by liberalism and monetarism."	es
Coherence and actions are needed.In the next Lomé agreement, investment in education and stimulate regional cooperation and participation of local entities must be specified.The participation of local entities is the greatest importance.And, in a much broader framework, I consider priority the conversion of the debt of poor countries into poverty eradication and sustainable development programs, as well as the control of fraud and corruption.We must advance with concrete and coherent actions.Populations from poor countries begin to despair.I request the Commission to undertake proceedings in the sense of an urgent adhesion of Eastern Timor to the Lomé Agreement, as a way of promoting, among other measures, the eradication of poverty and accelerating its economic, cultural and social development, to reinforce its internal democratization.Finally, I congratulate the presidency of the Council for the next Europe-Africa summit and call all participants to achieve contributions to the materialization of practical actions for the development of peace, democracy and the eradication of poverty in underdeveloped African countries.Thank you very much Lord Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.Stabilization and Association Agreement with the AryM in accordance with the agenda, the report of the report (A5-0031/2000) of Mr. Swoboda, in the name of the Foreign Affairs Commission, Human Rights, Common Security and Defense Policy, on the decision recommendation of the Council for which the Commission is authorized to negotiate a stabilization and association with the former Yugoslava Republic of Macedonia,(Sec (1999) 1279 - C5-0166/1999 - 1999/2121 (Cos)).Mr. President, dear Patten Commissioner, dear colleagues, today we are discussing a country that has gone through really difficult times, a country that thanks to its own effort, its will and, undoubtedly, to the support of the international community has experienced a very positive advance.If, consequently, the European Union, the Council and the Commission propose, I dare to use this concept without any doubt to celebrate a stabilization and association agreement in the Europe in southeast, in the Balkans the Parliament will be added tomorrow, I suppose, to this proposal, this will be thanks to, or in recognition of, that Arym/Macedonia has worked to enjoy a good position from the economic point of view, but also and above all the economic point of view.War in neighboring countries and in relation to its own ethnic minority.Well, having an ethnic minority of 33 or even 35% in the country itself is no minor if you take into account of the environment in which this country is found.The country and its politicians surely with differences between them have always done a very good job, and this deserves our recognition.The commission proposes to enter into an agreement together with the Council.I would like to formulate a few observations related to the areas in which different conceptions possibly exist, although I also want to highlight in a particular way and recognize in this context the work and interest shown by Commissioner Patten by AryM/Macedonia and throughout the region.First: the regional approach.In my opinion, the regional approach is, if I have understood it correctly, important and necessary.	es
Articles 6 and 7 of the treaty would be, in effect, insufficient arriving the worst case.In this sense, it is necessary - and I would like to confirm and ratify it now here - that the commission persevere in the effort to ensure that the new letter of fundamental rights that must be prepared is incorporated into the treaty and establish some rights of mandatory compliance, enforceable before the courts.The Commission must also persevere, in this sense, in the constant consolidation of the common space of freedom, security and justice, and therefore, in this aspect I maintain a position opposite to that of the two speakers that have preceded me.It is only possible to respond to the irrational, deceptive and demagogic statements of the right, of the extreme right, contrasting the principles of immigration and the right of asylum.However, I want to highlight it -this policy must also be accompanied by a coherent and convincing policy of employment and against social exclusion, since unemployment, marginalization and increasing inequalities constitute an optimal breeding ground for nationalist feelings and actions of an antieuropeo nature.Mr. President of the Commission, I also would like to review in this context to the problems that you have raised in relation to the issue of globalization and the perception that they have broad sectors of the population.The feeling of impotence, lack of influence and lack of support from the State lead to the best of cases to the distancing of politics and electoral abstention, as happened in European elections, and in the worst case, to extremist electoral behaviors.In this context, the union - which not everyone understands - must offer our EU citizens of the EU as a medium, as a protection against the negative effects of globalization.We are building a house, but too few of our own citizens really feel at home at it.Therefore, not only is a reform of the World Trade and Economic Architecture reform necessary -and it is significant that the President of the Commission has forgotten to mention the reform of financial institutions, of international financial architecture -but also necessary to take generating measures of confidence in favor of our citizens, who are authorized to wait with all the right help and support from the EU, and within the EU, and within the EU, and within the EU, and within the EU, and within the EU, and within the EU.painful processes of adaptation to new world circumstances.In this context, what the commission about the strengthening of the voice of Europe can say.Mr. President, you have talked about a model about which, unfortunately, I find too few references in the document.He said that we must offer our citizens a model of economic, social, cultural and ecological development, inside and outside the Union, which is clearly distinguished from other models, also including the American.The United States, in addition to being our partners, are also our competitors in this regard, not adversaries, but competitors, and we must compete to settle who can offer the best model to our citizens.I would like the statements that we pronounce today with such vehemence also find a greater place in the commission documents.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, the greatest legacy of her commission to the European Union could be her contribution to the restoration and a new distribution of the powers and powers of the Commission, which are increasingly intertwined and are more confused, and that may even be extended even to the Union.	es
The authors of this question do not offer any solution but call for a new tax, call for an additional bureaucracy, a measure against market mechanisms and seize the plenary of an intergroup design by short-circuiting the competent parliamentary committee, in contradiction with several decisions of the Parliament.In my opinion, and I clearly say, this question is motivated by ideology and is not oriented towards a solution.I repeat that I consider this as an erroneous path.Why do we refuse the Tobin tax and consider it so much questionable?First, as the commissioner also confirmed, because it represents a very heavy burden for the capital markets.A reduced tax would also have heavy repercussions on the capital markets because such a speculation tax would greatly reduce the profitability of investments.In addition, such a measure would also greatly hamper the development of financial markets.This would go against the principle of free movement of capital which is at the curriculum of the internal market.Second, speculative capital is difficult to identify.Third, tax measures can easily be bypassed if they are not simultaneously introduced in all countries because there are many shelters.Fourth, this measure is hardly applicable on the technical level, generates a large bureaucratic and administrative load and is difficult to control.The measure that we should take relates to part of the resolution presented to us.This is the strengthening of banking control.It is a question of clarifying the responsibility of the transactions.This is an international regulatory framework.It is a question of examining national laws in order to determine whether they correspond to the rules of the Basel Committee and if the latter can be disseminated more.I have a big problem with a crucial point of this resolution that we cannot accept as it is.This is point 9. If we have followed the commissioner, we know that the knowledge of the commission on this case will lead him to say no to the Tobin tax.If the said knowledge, the debate and the arguments are such as we expose them and as they seem justified, I believe that it is irresponsible to mobilize the commission six more months and to generate in this way doing uncertainty in the financial and capital markets.The capital market does not expect from us that we are bringing uncertainty, it needs clarity.This is why we reject point 9 and ask for a separate vote.The president, the debate on the taxation of short -term financial transactions is not new.We have been discussed for twenty years from the Tabin tax proposal and, yet this question is still topical because we really need concrete and sincere answers based on scrupulous studies.We must know to what extent a taxation of short -term financial transactions is truly desirable and achievable.Today, this question actually takes on another dimension since, every day, USD 1500 billion travel around the world 24 hours a day, looking for attractive investments, and that at most 3 % of this sum is linked to the real economy.	fr
The recent dioxin alarm in Belgium and even before the ESB crisis in Great Britain, as well as the persistent controversy on the safety of genetically modified foods have contributed to undermining consumer confidence in foods.If the commission manages to reconstruct trust in the food production chain, at the same time it will reconstruct trust in the European institutions themselves and demonstrate that they are able to protect the rights of European citizens.For this reason, I rejoice that the question of food security, public health and consumer trust have a prominent place in the commission's work program for 2000. However, the nature of the proposal relating to the creation of a European food authority in the recent White Paper has disappointed me.Currently the proposal concerns more than anything else a consultative agency for the executive, rather than an independent body with legislative and decision -making skills more similar to those of the American Food and Drug Administration, which has already affirmed its credibility in this field.In addition, the future legislation will face the modus operandi of relations between the European food authority and national authorities, for example the Irish authority for food safety.This organ, together with the cross -border body recently established in Ireland for food safety, is already carrying out a good job.It would be a tragedy if these efforts were threatened by community legislative deficiencies.My fear is that these deficiencies in community legislation could trigger wars of competence between national and community bodies that instead should work together and not one against the other.This is something we have to look at from.Mrs. President, today's presentation by President Prodi by force of things was only a brushstroke.We expect the details year by year, for example as regards the social action program that will have to be presented this year.We will also examine it in the perspective of social policy and employment and submit it to a series of tests.We will verify to what extent it is possible to create an equilateral triangle of policies, which combines economic policy, employment policy and social policy.At this moment social policy arranges behind economic and employment policy.In the framework of the strategy for employment, we will verify the deepening and expansion of the strategy following the revision carried out under the Portuguese presidency and in the context proposed by it.Regarding the social dimension, we will evaluate if an in -depth analysis of the internal market is proposed with a social component.The explosion of the mergers, the sales and the relevance of companies to which we assist as the market is strengthened mean that we must update the matrix of the directives on information and consultation of the workers adopted in the past, but we must also complete them with a new general framework of information and consultation provisions and with an update of the directive on European company committees.We also need a code of conduct for companies in order to ensure that they actually work in an atmosphere of partnership with employees to manage change.	it
On average, to manage $ 10 million aid, the Commission has a staff of 2.9 people, compared to 4.3 of the World Bank and between 4 and 9 in the major Member States.This is a serious problem: there are too many financial instruments, each with its own characteristics and, in particular, a series of different budget items.It is difficult to reconcile this situation with the needs of an effective management system.To deal with and solve these problems, the community must engage in a real dialogue with the Member States and Parliament.It is absolutely essential to face the question of consistency in a realistic and pragmatic way, which means starting discussions in the adequate institutional context, that is, with the Council and Parliament.The lack of concerted actions between the 15 Member States and the community must also be addressed.By focusing the community development policy on international strategies and objectives we will spend the way towards better complementarity with the Member States.This is almost the line illustrated a little, indeed by the president in office for the Amado Council.Today, when we talk about policies, we commit ourselves in a convergence process.This is part of the solution.We are engaged in the formulation of new programmatic guidelines and we must identify the priority sectors for community intervention.Everything has become increasingly complex, and this also applies to cooperation in the field of development.No donor is able to deal with the entire spectrum of issues alone, ranging from macroeconomic issues to the regulatory framework or from sectoral policies to a variety of new transversal issues, such as gender issues, the environment, good governance and institutional reforms.It is important to identify flexible mechanisms that allow a distribution of work based on the skills and skills of the different donors in each country developed.This should be done at the level of the Member States and should lead to the formulation of sectoral policies for community intervention.This is the goal we aim to achieve.In order to identify the priority sectors for Community support, the specific characteristics of the community must be taken into account with respect to Member States and international institutions.I quote only a few: our ability to associate development policy with commercial policy and to guarantee synergies between aid and economic cooperation;our neutrality and the protection of the general interests of the community;The fact that we represent a critical mass and that we are able to carry out relatively vast range of interventions compared to what the individual Member States can normally norm.Furthermore, our concrete presence: basically, I believe that our biggest value is precisely the fact that, since we represent ourselves a successful attempt at regional cooperation, we are seen as a neutral and welcome partner for this experiment worldwide, a role that no one else can boast.It is vital importance to make community policy more effective and develop a more operational strategic framework.The Commission must accept this double challenge, presenting a proposal for a general political declaration over the next few months.	it
Now the situation is so much pointed that the Pentagon banned the American armed forces to return to northern Mitroviæa.They have now been replaced by robust Danish, Finnish and Swedish troops.It is easy to despair in view of the violence and hatred, but for Kosovo, the Balkans and for Europe it is important that we do not fail here.The stability pact gives us great commitments.Thus, this matter becomes a test for the credibility of the union's common foreign and security policy.At the moment there is an immense lack of suitable staff in Kosovo.Bernard Kouchner already demanded a civilian police last autumn.I am therefore pleased to hear now that Mr. Javier Solana will gather the Interior Minister at the weekend to discuss the police question.I hope these conversations will primarily revolve around Kosovo, so that the desperate location can be ended there.As for the Balkans and Kosovo, I also hope that the Council also supports the claim of Parliament and, as I understood, the Commission also supports the Commission for a multi -year budget for missions in Kosovo.Mr. Solana!The situation in Kosovo has taught us a lot, e.g.B. the creation of military capacity for crisis management, which has already been put into practice.Another, at least as important experience is that preventing a crisis is more important than later fire brigade operations.For this reason, the EU also needs independent and credible funds for conflict prevention.As for the Commission, Commissioner Patten has already undertaken several commendable initiatives in this direction.I am thinking of the proposal for setting up a Rapid Reaction Facility and a Rapid Reaction Force for non -military missions as well as the creation of headline goals for non -military missions and a commission crisis center.My last question to Mr. Javier Solana is: What specific steps are planned for conflict prevention?How is this organized in Mr. Solana's office and coordinated with the work of the Commission?President, Mr. Solana, you enjoy the full support and trust of the liberals' parliamentary group, but we would like to remind you of the huge responsibility that is now on your shoulders.On the one hand, I think of the upcoming important humanitarian, peace -based and peace -creating tasks.However, I also think of their responsibility that the new European cooperation in the field of defense does not run a wedge between NATO and the EU or between the USA and Europe.Such a split would only use those rifles and despotic states that threaten freedom and human rights.I think you have taken note of the concerns that some members of the American congress have been expressed here in Parliament last week.You have to clear these concerns, Mr. Solana.You have put it yourself so that we can do something when we work across the Atlantic.Disability makes us weak and thereby extends the suffering of the oppressed.Therefore, dear Mr. Solana, keep in touch with our American Allies as close as possible and also take into account Norway, Turkey and Canada.	de
The respect and inviolability of human values, the rights of minority and those of all citizens who live in the territory of the European Union represent the foundations on which the principle of the EU law state is based.That's why the Convention on Fundamental Rights should also be binding from a legal point of view and not relegated to the role of simple declaration.Our support for Austrian democratic forces is also equally important;None of us intend to isolate this country.We know perfectly perfect that most of the Austrians respect these values ​​as they have shown, also publicly, through their protest that did not take place outside the borders of Austria.Certainly there are also many voters who with the vote wanted to give voice to their strong desire to attend a radical change of course in Austrian politics.In my opinion, Parliament should support these democratic forces.I also invite the Austrian president to commit himself to the maximum in trying to form a government based on these democratic forces.Madam president, deputies, simply I would like to underline the value of an attitude like what the president of our group, Francis Wurtz, recalled a little while ago.I appreciate the declarations of the Prime Minister and the position of the 14 countries that refused official contacts with the Austrian government if Jörg Haider's party was included.This underlining of ours is all the more important because we, as is known, are substantially disagreement with policies made by this Europe: from its economic and social policies, by its deficit of democracy, by the involvement of these same countries in the dramatic Balkan war.This dissent highlights today's appreciation even more: an exceptional element, because it is exceptional the danger of a rebirth, in Europe, of an irrational and neo -Nazi component.This danger does not concern Austria, it concerns Europe.Let's talk about us, not of Austria.We know the social causes that contribute, with unemployment and uncertainty, to feed propensities in that direction;We know the cultural causes - xenophobic, racist - but we cannot fail to indicate in the inability and non -will of these far -right forces to deal with Nazism, the possibility of building an explosive mixture in Europe.It speaks of the Alpine arc, it speaks of all our countries: conditions are being created for which a danger to European democracy and civilization can be reborn.The position taken of the presidency was aware of this drama of civilization.Europe shows that she has not forgotten Auschwitz;Europe meets a soul.Now, however, it should be consequent in its actions, and the first to be consequent should be the commission which, however, has shown here an opacity and a lability that make the value of the position of the presidency even more evident.This is the correction to be imposed on the action of the Commission.Mrs. President, colleagues, in the fundamental democratic principle of respect for human rights and the freedom and sovereignty of peoples, against every new or old fascism, Nazism or communism, and since all the previous speakers have spoken of sovereignty the Austrian people, we see, today, denied this sovereignty by this parliament.	it
It is true that the problem of the wood sector is terribly complex.You have indeed talked about unlocking funds for storage of wood because it should not be depreciated.On the other hand, the municipalities which have not been affected by storms will also undergo damage, since the National Forest Office has decided to freeze the forest cuts for four years.So these municipalities which have not suffered losses will still see their recipes decrease.All this to tell you that the problem is eminently complex and I thank the commission again to push the analysis of this situation as far as possible.I would also like to draw your attention to the fact that there is, of course, economic disaster, but that real ecological disasters are still to come.You have said it yourself, Mr. Commissioner, these disasters, these storms are not always natural and we believe that these are the first signs of climate change.So we have to review our policies to integrate this data.Mr. President, all those who arrived here by car, train or plane could see the extent of the damage caused particularly in France by the hurricanes of unprecedented violence that hit Europe at the end of last month.Faced with a disaster of such magnitude, what can elected officials of the European Parliament do?First of all, I want to salute all my mayors, local elected officials, who, on a daily basis, had to reassure the population, organize solidarity, cooperate with public services.They deserved the confidence of their fellow citizens.I then want to thank here the rescue services and the armed forces of the Member States of the Union which, as part of exemplary intergovernmental cooperation, came to support the efforts of their French colleagues.I would also like to wonder about the paradoxical situation in which we are in terms of emergency aid.If this disaster had taken place in Guatemala or Turkey, we could immediately involve the community budget for the benefit of the victims, but in our countries nothing is possible, for lack of adequate line of credit.We must also ask the Commission not to prevent local communities and states from helping businesses disaster -based by the disaster, in the name of an overly close application of community competition rules.I especially think of particularly struck fishing and conchyliculture companies.As you said, as you said, the Commissioner, that forced activity judgments can be compensated and that the investments which are entirely to be rebuilt can call on Ifop.Beyond that, I believe that the mechanical application of POPs is no longer put in the disaster regions.I therefore ask the Commission to give it up for, on the contrary, helping sea professionals to make new investments that are urgently imposed on them.Mr. President, dear colleagues, the storms that ravaged France in the night of December 26 and 27, as we said, 90 dead, 75 billion francs, or 11 billion euros, damage.	fr
The design of the council has serious defects, especially in relation to legal protection.According to the reports of the rapporteur di Pietro, the draft even contains very significant deficits.The agreement enables a chain of request for legal welfare, whereby every member authorities and criminal law systems can be assigned to other Member States.This chain is structured in such a way that it cannot be controlled by a single judge as a whole.Flanking measures, for example the obligation for investigators, need to appear as a witness to request in every criminal matter in which their documents are used.For my faction, it is also problematic that the council draft disregards the proportional principle.In any case, the area of ​​application is not restricted.This agreement is not only applicable to combating serious crimes and organized crime.There is even nowhere that it only refers to criminal law.It is therefore quite conceivable that the European Union will soon shoot at sparrows with cannons and to dissolve the rights of citizens in smoke.Mr. President, which deals with us today with legal assistance in criminal matters, contains minimum regulations that are essential for effective and quick cooperation between the various judicial and investigative organs.It concerns the deliveries, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of imprisoned persons, the return of objects, the questioning of witness by video conference, the investigation, including the so -called hidden investigations, telephone monitoring, etc.m. This is the minimum that could be agreed, whereby it must be said that if there are some change requests such as No. 32 or No. 81 or 71 in their revised version, the overall agreement would result in the mere exchange of messages or information and could really be thrown into the trash, which is why we would be correct.I hope that the colleagues of the various political groups can be guided by their common sense and reject these amendments.The fact that it was not enough for a framework agreement, but only to an agreement, is a defeat for the European Parliament.Commissioner Vitorino will surely have taken out all the different articles, how necessary it is to create a framework for common rules, instead of continuing to continue with this incoherent regulation, these small conventions for individual areas such as the investigation or the .. It is rather absolutely necessary to create a minimum of more secure, more than the guarantees - also to ensure that it is possible to extend it as far as possibleneed to be increased.I only imagine what should become of this community, these agreements or the legal relationships if, for example, a fascist country like Turkey would join the European Union: I would be really at a loss.As everyone emphasized, we need a corpus juris and, especially in procedural law, common rules that ensure a common constitutional state throughout the community.It is obvious that this is a matter of which the government conference must mainly deal with and that the parliament can only make a limited contribution to this objective, since everything depends on the council and on the commission.In my opinion, this first half of the year, in which the responsible commissioner is Portuguese and Portugal, has the Presidency of Council, an excellent opportunity to give this joint objective a first impulse.	de
However, I took note of your comments and I will examine them more in -depth.Ms. Roth-Behrendt asked me a question about the establishment of a positive list.This is one of the questions we tackle in the appendix to the legislation and we intend to establish a positive list for substances intended for animal food.For the time being, the list is, I would say, negative and completes itself in the required manner.The establishment of a positive list constitutes one of the questions raised in the appendix and accompanied by a date, namely 2002. We have identified the fast alert system intended for animal feed as a gap in legislation.Quick alert exists for food and not for animal feed.It is unfortunate and incorrect and we think it is important to highlight it, to establish legislation in order to fill this gap and this will be done.Work in relation to ESB within Member States and the establishment of tests carried out at random in order to assess the levels of infectivity in the Member States are underway.I know that Mrs. Roth-Behrendt already asked me this question and I replied that I thought it was progressing quickly.However, I think I know that the question is at the stage of the consultation between the services within the Commission and that the work is currently underway.I hope that the next time you ask me, I will be able to provide you with more detailed information.Ms. Jackson stressed the fact that there are 24 new legislative acts and 20 modifying legislative acts.She also asks if this aggravates excess regulation.I would say that the legislative acts that we have identified are intended to fill the gaps in current legislation.This concerns less the establishment of new regimes or additional regulations, although it is part of it, than to identify where the gaps and weaknesses are located in the chain ranging from the stable to the table and to fill them.It has been referred to the candidate countries, something we keep in mind.The standards in food security and of course other areas of security are of obviously crucial importance with regard to enlargement and this is a question to which I drew the attention of Mr. Verheugen.The Commissioner, the ignorance of certain Member States has plunged Europe into a large -scale food crisis and I am once again irritated, unfortunately, to note the total and renewed absence of the Council when you present this interesting report.I would really like you to tell me how you intend to guarantee that this new authority, whatever its detailed name, will have the influence on the advice, which will have its say within this authority, which will give the orders.It goes without saying that we cannot impose anything in terms of content but I still insist that after Maastricht and Amsterdam, the parliament retains its right, and even that it develops it.	fr
"In today's debate, many words have been pronounced that correspond to essential concepts of today: globalization, knowledge society, relations between the old economy and the new economy.All those words and the concepts that are behind them can correspond simultaneously to opportunities and problems.And the imperative that arises is to transform problems into opportunities and above all to avoid at all costs transform opportunities into problems.It is evident that, for us to get it, there are two essential issues in all spheres.First, a very strong investment in people and a decisive concept mentioned here by so many of their lordships: training and education throughout life are an investment in people, a decisive issue for all these matters to become an opportunity for all.But, in addition to investment in people, it is also necessary that there are regulatory capacity of public authorities, whether they are national states, the European Union or world authorities, in the sense of making the indispensable business and personal initiative compatible with the conditions of social justice and equity.That is true in the sphere of globalization.The globalization is something that allows a greater increase in wealth, international trade, productivity.But deregulation globalization, as it exists today, or the globalization in which large sectors of the world population do not have a strong investment in people is also a factor of exclusion, division, expansion of the pit between rich and poor.That is true in the Knowledge Society, which can provide a new equal opportunities, but it can also be an increasingly clear separation factor between those who have access to it and those who do not have it, as occurs in relations between old and new economy.For the rest, it is not the first time that there is a technological transition that modifies the paradigm of society and the organization of the economy.And what has always happened in those moments of deep transition is that the problems of the old economy, in particular those of employment, are always resolved to the new economy and its instruments.I give an example: in Europe we have a textile industry and we must continue to have it, but we will only have it, if we can apply the technologies of the Information Society and the Knowledge Society.And it is still extraordinary that at this time, in the sectors of the so -called ""New Economy"", there is a lack of almost 80,000 people suitable for jobs that exist, just like there are millions of unemployed.Which means that we have not yet been able to use the instruments of the new economy to solve the problems of the old economy, which will never have a solution with the logic of that same old economy.Finally, I want to answer a question that has been asked: if I speak here in the name of fifteen or fourteen countries.The answer is simple: I speak on behalf of fifteen countries.And one of the things that the Portuguese presidency has guaranteed is the full participation of Austria in the functioning of all the institutions of the Union."	es
"Mr Andersson will surely know the phenomenon known under the name of prohibition and also know what were the consequences for the activities of the US mafia.So much so that in the end it was decided to abolish prohibition.It is obvious that we must protect the health of citizens, but not by forbidding alcoholic beverages, since it is obvious that it is useless.Mr. President, in reality these are the revenue deriving from the monopoly on the alcohol of the Swedish state.When the Swedish government claims to have it to cover the health costs, it shows that we are in the presence of a distortion of competition since other countries must independently finance their health costs without being able to have a monopoly on alcohol.My question is as follows: she is also aware of studies that say that moderate consumption of high quality alcohol products such as French wine or Bavarian beer can even be healthy and that therefore even a relief of the Swedish budget could derive from it.I seem to have understood that the honorable MEMT referred to the tax of the matter.And if I am not mistaken, the high excise duties on alcohol in Sweden date back to 1638 and since then much of the state fiscal revenue comes from the sale of alcohol.It is also known that currently in Sweden there is a state monopoly, which in itself already represents a violation of the union legislation.Therefore, as far as the healing power of alcohol is concerned, it was to this that the honorable S meeting referred if I did not get badly - I agree with him one hundred percent.In my opinion, a good bottle of wine can do very well to health and at the level of social contacts it can be extremely pleasant.Perhaps the honorable S Melt, the honorable Andersson and the undersigned one of these days we could meet at the Parliament bar to drink a glass of Aquavit together.Mr President, I followed with interest the commission's response regarding the need to apply the legislation on the single market.I wonder if the commissioner can tell me if he considers his response compatible with the fact that the Commission has not brought the French government before the Court of Justice due to the application of the French law ""Loi et Vin"" which in fact prevents the application of legislation on the single market for the sale of alcohol in France.Can we expect that the European Commission present an appeal against France to the Court of Justice?I would like to answer very briefly to the question of the honorable parliamentary, since the question is currently being examined by the Commission.The Commission must decide whether the question is to be considered closed or if it should be brought to the attention of the Court of Justice.Perhaps my answer will not be satisfactory at the moment, but I want to reassure the honorable parliamentary that the commission will adopt a decision within a few weeks.I appeal to the understanding of the honorable parliamentary for this small delay in the Commission's decision.Mr. Commissioner exist, there are public health reasons that justify different tax rates, for example for the Scottish whiskey rather than French burgundy wine or even colleague's Bavarian beer?"	it
"The truly substantial difference concerns the charge of costs for waste disposal.Colleague Bouwman has already focused on this aspect.There are two experiences on the subject.That of the Baltic Sea, and therefore an experience not only national, but of the whole Baltic basin, according to which, including the costs for disposal in general port rights in the wide part, the elimination of the waste of the ships no longer encourages.Once paid, it is worth providing for the disposal of waste in the port.The second system is based on the pure principle of ""polluting pays"": the ships that land waste are required to pay an additional amount.This second system proved to be ineffective, otherwise why would the Mediterranean be so dirty?Why is the North Sea equally dirty?Because the principle of ""who pollutes pays"", without adequate checks, does not work!Here is the reason why a large majority during the commission - not a great majority and now the representatives of the minority opinion will intervene - reiterated the thesis approved at first reading by Parliament without any clash, namely that the best system is the system of the No Special Fee, since, in a certain sense, it offers ships an economic incentive not to throw in sea waste to to deposit them in the affixed port collection systems.The decisive point is this.We are willing to an agreement with the Council, but to date the Council has rejected any serious agreement with us.Therefore, launch an appeal to this classroom to recommend the adoption of our amendment in which we ask for coverage up to 90 percent of costs through port rights.In this way we would have the opportunity to grant us with the Council in the conciliation, you want on 75 percent, you want on another percentage.I also turn to the Commission: Madam Vice President, pay attention to which part he intends to take sides!I believe, in the interest of the protection of the environment, of a durable and flourishing tourism industry in many community countries that is better an effective system.I support, please, our no special fee system, perhaps so we will reach a reasonable compromise with the Council in the conciliation.Mr. President, I am pleased that she is the one who presides over the discussion, because I know, that being Bavarian, she always pays close attention to the issues relating to ports and seas.I want to thank the speaker, honorable Theo Bouwman, for his work and for his collaboration during the preparation of tomorrow's vote.Tomorrow it will be about to decide on a couple of points.First, we know that the transport of people and goods via ship is the most ecological than other ways of transport.At the same time, however, we also know that the ships contribute widely to marine pollution, through waste, load residues and flashes.The fuel for ships is heavy oil and we know that the 1-3 percent of this heavy oil remains in the form of mampery which is usually downloaded into the sea."	it
I would like to ask the president in the exercise of the Council, who has spent a few hours in this hemicycle working with the deputies of the European Parliament, if he has come to get an idea of ​​what they are worth in terms of remuneration of honor, such as this debate on the fees of the European Parliament is not exclusive to his country and even extends to my country, I have an exact idea of ​​how much the fees of the deputies ascend to the European Parliament.Therefore, I am perfectly aware of that problem.Mr. President, I appreciate the answer.I want to ask a complementary question that has some similarity with that of Mr. Sjöstedt.We are both Swedes.In our country the largest tax is the municipal, since the services are local and abundant.There are problems related to politicians and, in no less proportion, in European politicians in Parliament.How do you think that confidence in us, politicians, if we are granted the right to use services at the places where we live - schools, assistance, etc. - but, at the same time, we not pay taxes, we do not contribute?How do you think that a system of this nature would influence us?It is a question, Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, that I do not know if he is obliged to answer because he is really philosophical.But if you want to enter the field of philosophy, go ahead!No, Mr. President, I don't feel tempted to enter the field of philosophy.These are underground issues and related to the matrix of the deputy statute itself and its role, within the framework of political society.I do not want to enter that type of debate, because it seems to me that it could - to use a French expression - préjuger the interpretation that the Portuguese presidency does within the framework of the negotiations, in which it is immersed, on the statute of the deputies.I would like to ask that in this regard allow me not to advance any comment.Having exhausted the time assigned to the question shift to the Council, questions 11 to 35 will be answered in writing.The question shift to the Council is closed.(The session, interrupted at 19.05, resumes at 9:00 p.m.) address of Mr. Vaclav Havel, President of the Czech Republic Mr. President, Ladies, in the name of the European Parliament, I have the great honor of giving an effusive welcome to Mr. Václav Havel, President of the Czech Republic.I would also like to express the welcome to Mrs. Havel, who has held a position in the gallery.Lady, welcome.(Applause) It is not the first time we welcome him in our Parliament, Mr. President.You already talked to the Plenary, in Strasbourg, in March 1994, almost six years ago, and many of us retain a very intense memory of it, that is, those of our colleagues who were already deputies at that time.Indeed, just after the entry into force of the Maastricht Treaty, you pronounced in favor of strengthening European values, the creation of a European ethical dimension, of the opening of the Union to the countries of central and eastern Europe.	es
"I do not say that the degree of specialization of workers in the sector should not be increased - it is obvious that it is necessary to do it -, but first it is necessary to allow jobs to be created.The availability of non -specialized, temporary and seasonal work is very important in some economic sectors of the community.Tourism contributes to regional development in rural areas that are trying to diversify and to that of urban areas that try to highlight the importance of their cultural heritage.Considering together all these aspects we can truly do something in Europe and perhaps we will be able to stretch the tourist season by throwing the holidays on our continent.We must not forget that with the expansion we will have the opportunity to increase the number of tourists who land in Europe to visit those monuments of our cultural heritage that for many years - about forty - have not been open to the public.We are losing market shares, and I think something should be done to make us more competitive.So I hope you want to help us.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, today we deal with a very important sector, which gives work directly to more than 10 million people in the EU and which helps the more or less disadvantaged regions, as well as the insular and more remote areas, to bring forward.Tourism creates an additional number of jobs, contributing to the consolidation of employment especially for the most vulnerable bands of society, that is, women and young people.In light of such data, I think that the lack of a European tourism policy constitutes a serious contradiction.The absence of a legal basis makes the adoption of measures in the sector in question impossible.The occasional use of article 308 (ex 235), which provides for unanimity, prevented a five -year program from 8 million ECU for all the Member States.The measures adopted sporadically in the past have been fragmented and ineffective, and their provisions have been dictated by parallel policies in the sectors, for example, of consumer protection, the environment, transport, taxes, etc.;These were policies that not only did not help tourism but rather hindered it, given that their application often presupposed a cost for the tourism sector, without ever in depth the way to help or encourage the latter.I emphasize with regret that today tourism, within the framework of the renovation of the commission services, is only a sector - and not a direction - in the context of the ""Enterprise"" General Management.In my opinion, our tourism must instead be supported and the pillars for this support can be the following: addition of a chapter dedicated to tourism in the revision that will give a legal basis to the sector;processing of a common tourist policy that will support the sector without upsetting the functioning of the relative market;coordination between tourism policy and other parallel common policies that influence it directly or indirectly;Sector study and adoption of medium and long -term measures to help the competitiveness of the tourist product."	it
The history of the Joint Assembly attests in this regard, in a resounding way, of a positive evolution.If before the ACP countries were represented in the meetings by members of the governments, senior officials or ambassadors, today more than three quarters of our interlocutors and interlocutors are chosen parliamentarians.We must celebrate a great party when we soon reach 100%, as you want with the new agreement.Advances in democratization processes, which, unlike the various crisis outbreaks, are produced discreetly, unfortunately go unnoticed.A specific element of multilateral ACP collaboration is regional cooperation and integration.This will fulfill a desire for the long list of desires of Parliament.The Joint Assembly will soon hold meetings at the regional level.We have already been able to listen.Strengthening regional cooperation may contribute to preventing conflicts for ethnic, economic, social or religious reasons, that is, it can have a preventive effect.For the same reason, the European Parliament has promoted from the beginning the participation of civil society in the decision -making processes and in cooperation management and has revealed the meaning of decentralized collaboration.The intensification of the contacts between the Joint Assembly and the social agents, provided for in the new agreement, is one more step in the right direction.There is only a slope of sadness due to the fact that the European Development Aid Fund is not yet integrated into EU Budgets.I hope we do not have to wait another 25 years until in this regard we reach our goal.Mr. President, let me congratulate Mr. Corrie for his report.The Lomé Convention has attest to an authentic partenariat between the EU and the ACP countries for more than 25 years, and the fact that it has continued in despite the overwhelming pressure against which it has received from many organizations, including the WTO, represents a whole triumph.However, it is obvious that the new agreement must not be evaluated for its mere existence, but because of the way in which it can contribute to the EU's commitment to eradicate poverty and achieve international development objectives.If we apply this criterion, we will realize that the new agreements present a series of deficiencies: for example, the agreement is quite disappointing for ACP countries that suffer short -term fluctuations in their export income.In December, during a marathon negotiations round, the agreement was reached to provide aid to island states, to those who have no way out of the sea and the least developed when they suffer losses of at least 2% in their export income, while the other ACP countries would continue to be applied the scale of 10%.However, at the end of the negotiations, the EU alleged that she had never given her approval to include the islands and countries without the sea among the candidates deserving of aid based on the limit of 2%.This change has had devastating consequences, especially for the Windward Islands, which is possibly the only ACP country that will actually be harmed with the new agreements.	es
And all this must be realized thinking about the European citizen.It is necessary to do it by keeping in mind the men and women who work and who live their daily lives in our countries.The extraordinary summit of Lisbon will have to basically reconfirm the idea that the European Union remains faithful to a society aimed at promoting integration and social cohesion in the European citizen.Mr. President, the Portuguese presidency has the merit of focusing the debate on issues which, although not new, are set in a new way with courageous objectives, starting with the urgency to deal with the issue of competitive ability based on innovation and permanent technological democratization, given that the technological development of the United States arises from a very dynamic private initiative but also from the military sectorprotectionism.It is also to evaluate the case of Japan, from which Europe could draw lessons in the organization of work, the responsibility of the State and the companies - and also of the same worker - against the objectives of business.To these two models we must inspire us for useful aspects such as entrepreneurial ability and work organization, maintaining the best of Europe, its adequate social model to a post -industrial economy.The fact is that Europe takes 32 million jobs to achieve the levels of the United States, there are an increase in female employment, the integration of marginalized groups, the strengthening of social cohesion (a problem that structural funds have not yet resolved), the insertion of five million unemployed of very long duration, largely due to industrial reconversions, we need new specializations since access to technologyIt is not a silent guarantee of quality of employment and entrepreneurial initiative.We need greater participation and responsibility of the social partners, new actors, as they say in the Pintassilgo report, to create pacts for the employment and competitiveness of businesses.We must solve the problems of poverty and we need a social model suitable for new conditions.Mr. President in office for the Council, his proposal is courageous although it does not depend directly on her but on fifteen.As for the question of Austria, I would really like this country to be part of the group of states that will make this proposal concrete.If he did, however, Austria would deceive and lie to the voters of a part of his government.I hope it still does it!Mr. President in office for the Council, Mr. President of the Commission, the statement we live in a globalized world is a statement that our fellow citizens, regardless of their level of preparation or their ideology, have heard many times.However, the more rarely we hear what the role of Europe must be in this context of the company of information, globalization and technology.I happen to think, Mr. President, that this probably happens because perhaps we Europeans have a perception of Europe sometimes a little far from our closest concerns and interests.The first concern of European citizens, after health, is probably the job.	it
"I hope that what we have affirmed today with such vehemence will also find greater response in the documents of the Commission.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, the greatest inheritance that the Commission could leave to the European Union would be to reorganize and redistribute the increasingly chaotic and confused powers and skills of the executive and perhaps of the same union.You took a first brave step, rightly underlining the need to focus on the so -called ""fundamental activities"".As you have said this today, this means that it is necessary to identify the tasks, policies and programs that are marginal or irrelevant compared to the primary vocation of the Commission.Many policies and many current programs of the European Union have probably already passed their expiry date, or have proved to be difficult to manage or ineffective at European level.Today's challenge is to find the courage to delegate as much as possible not fundamental activities to a lower, national, regional or local level of government.If we want to convince the European public opinion of the merits of further European integration, we must be able to demonstrate that we are so busy on the front of the lower delegation of European skills not justified as on the front of the attribution to the European Union of new powers.We must not allow the detractors of the European integration to support, as they currently do with some reason - we have heard of it by the honorable bonde - that the proliferation of community responsibilities is a one -way road.We must demonstrate that it is a process in two directions, in the context of which the policies and programs of the union not fully justified on the basis of subsidiarity and proportionality, are delegated and abandoned.If we manage in the coming years to make these concrete events correspond to these aspirations, we will make an unprecedented contribution to the future of the European Union as a whole, and as we have heard today, you will be able to benefit from a broad consensus within this parliament.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, I fully associate myself with the logic of the proposals of colleague Heidi Hautala about the strategic objectives of the Commission for the next five years.For my part, I will intervene on a topic that has not been addressed, despite being expected, that is, the work program of the Commission for the year 2000 in progress.They are aware of the limits of the operation: working as part of the treaty in force, we must stick to its rules.I think in particular of an important topic, that is, the tax problem, but I really don't want to talk about tax aspects.I instead start by welcoming some proposals of the program for the year 2000. I think of all the ambitious and important proposals on food safety and also the safety of navigation, after the two black tides that hit the coasts of Brittany and Turkey.It is good that the Commission quickly reacts.Conversely, in other areas I believe that one could be more ambitious and proceed more quickly.I would like to advance a series of positive proposals regarding, for example, the social, the environment and the sequel to be given to Seattle."	it
Among the most unprotected, it is important that I intervene on this point, are immigrants and refugees.Thus, almost systematic detention conditions, the criminalization of the asylum applicant are no longer acceptable.Any asylum applicant must be entitled to equitable hearing and a resource with suspensive effect.Last week I attended, a little by chance, at Roissy airport, to a scene of unusual violence in which two young women, clandestine without a doubt, they were returned to Conakry.They were treated as the worst criminals.They were naked, they were dragged by land from the hair and escorted by a horde of CRS.The Portuguese presidency must end this type of barbarian acts.Our role is, on the contrary, to accompany, reassure, help those fleeing dictatorships.The Commission proposed the creation of a European Fund for Refugees.Parliament was very favorable to it.Instead of hesitation on the budget granted to this fund, I think you can adopt the decision to apply it.The Presidency and the Council can realize what was rejected incomprehensibly in Tampere, although Tampere has constituted an important basis.In the same way, we cannot settle for verifying the increase in xenophobic currents in Europe, the trivialization of discriminations, without adopting size measures.The harmonization of laws against racism is imposed.What is the point of giving article 13 of the treaty? What do you plan to do to promote equal salaries between men and women? How do you expect to work for the eradication of homophobia, racism and sexism?It is necessary to take the best of what is already being done in each of the countries of the Union.When six European countries grant the right to vote, its president can afford to expand that right of vote and eligibility in the municipal and European elections to all extra -community citizens who have residing for more than five years in the European territory.Thus, the regularization of roles without some countries, including your, must become an example for others, since those without papers are currently a mass of fragilized people in the hands of dream merchants and a workforce subject to personal benefit and an economic exploitation that makes them modern slaves.More generally, this presidency must begin a principle of change in the behaviors and relations of our fellow citizens with minorities and immigrants.Immigration is too often synonymous with insecurity and violence and responses are purely repressive.How do you plan to make our fellow citizens understand that today, as always, immigration is a source of social and cultural wealth, whose function is and will be indispensable in the demographic context we know? What action does it tell to carry out to value the place of immigrants in our society and guarantee true protection to asylum seekers?Mr. President, there is a great lack of transparency in the field of security, freedom and justice.The European Union is an economic portent, but we are not in a position to pontify when it is time to talk about the treatment of refugees.The level of racism in our society is terrifying.	es
"However, we would like to emphasize that it is essential to accept the strategy for the new millennium as soon as possible, which is intended to give the work performed as part of the previous action plan.In the area of ​​Justitial Cooperation, important progress in the protection of criminal law of the euro has also been made, and in the European Parliament, a framework decision of fundamental and strategic importance is currently being advised.In our opinion, the EU's criminal law requires to be credible to be credible that we have to avoid multiplication of the instruments and therefore have to make joint efforts in order to be able to assume a single instrument in March that covers the entirety of the topics that are to be treated, both those that consist of France's initiatives, as well as those whose acceptance has expressly described the Commission itself.In this area, it is important that measures to mutual recognition of court decisions are put into practice, and thanks to the work already done, we consider it possible that, at least in the area of ​​confiscation of goods, steps will soon be initiated to mutual recognition of the decisions.After all, in relation to Europol, which has taken up its effective work in 1999 and caused the council to accept a number of instruments known to Parliament in order to enable his work, there is finally a fundamental question that is related to democratic control and the judicial control of Europol, which of course receive a new dimension from the political option adopted in Tampere, the area of ​​responsibility ofTo expand Europe and, above all, to give it an operational dimension.The French presidency has given us an important work document that presents different scenarios to discuss and solve the questions of the democratic and the judicial control of Europol.The Portuguese presidency will take the initiative to present a work document about the ""Euro Just"" network shortly, because although it is apparently not necessary that the judicial control of Europol via Euro was not ruled out that this is an alternative in the future.That is why it is now important that the pronunciation of the Council on the development of Europol and EuroJust takes place at the same time so that you can get the corresponding conclusions at the same time.I think in this area and in the area of ​​dialogue that the council and parliament inevitably have to lead to the development of Europol and Euro Just, we have the opportunity to find an institutionally acceptable solution for relationships between council and parliament in connection with Europol.We know the points of view of parliament and know that Parliament knows the positions of the legal services of the council.By solving the question of democratic control of Europol, this problem, I think, will find a final solution and a solution that mobilizes and strengthens the interinstitutional cooperation between everyone.President, ladies and men, men, men council members!First of all, I have to say that I am not moved - without wanting to go into an emotional competition with the gentlemen - but confused because I have two personal friends in the presidency for the first time, and I wish that this fact that is essential for the work of our Union is not affected."	de
The road has been very long, especially because of the legal problem that survived by the extent that it could be considered that the community had full competences in intellectual property issues.The problem has been overcome.Today we must give our opinion as essentially on two treaties: the Treaty to Intellectual Property and the Treaty on Interpretations or Executions and Phonograms.As for the first, it seems that it resolves effectively the demands of the authors of artistic and literary works, while creating the framework for protection in issues of distribution, rent and presentation of their works to the public.As for the second treaty on executions and phonograms, we must underline that for the first time they are recognized by an international treaty, which also signs the community, the exclusive rights of interpreters and artists for the production, distribution and rental of the public, as well as the right to a fair remuneration for broadcasting.In this framework, the great advance of the treaty in the issue of the right of reproduction must be pointed out.Although, as the commission mentions, in the texts of the treaties there are no special provisions that regulate all the additional issues that arise with technological development, it can be affirmed, however, that in this legislative framework that is being created, the interpreters enjoy a broader protection than that which derived from the Treaty of Rome or even the community directives.The interpretation of article 7 of the treaty leads us to the conclusion that the application of protection against reproduction does not mean only protection against the reproduction of the interpretations or the executions of them that are incorporated into phonograms, but also, protection against the copy, partial or total, permanent or ephemeral, as well as protection of all types of production.However, it would be convenient to refer to some points that must be the epicenter of the future works of the WMO or other diplomatic conferences.This is the right of distribution as refers to article 8, first section.The possibility given to the States, from the following section of the same article, to regulate the exercise of the right mentioned above, is dangerous and constitutes one of the most negative points of the treaty, since there is nothing that prevents member states from approveing ​​special conditions to exercise this right, something that will have negative consequences for artists.On the rental right, the interpretation of article 9 leads us to the conclusion that of the exclusive rental right enjoy only artists or interpreters, as long as it is provided for in national legislation, and I believe that here there is a difference in relation to article 13. To end I want to say that the ratification of these treaties opens horizons to the property right.For the 21st century, the century of knowledge and intangible economy, intellectual property will be a primary form of property and, in many cases, more important than traditional property.	es
"Mr. President, the place that women occupy in politics is an important issue that would deserve something better than the politically correct overpuja we attended.Without a doubt, there are not many women who participate in politics.It is not true that the predominance of men in the party devices is the only reason to be invoked.In France, 95% of the elected are councilors.Most of them are not affiliated with any party.In the departmental organs, the first party of France is that of the elected without label, which represent several left or right parties.To be elected local councilor, just love it, and on the implementation offered by these mandates often depends on the possibility of assuming national responsibilities.Our group wishes to promote a fair representation of men and women in the organs of the European Union.That is why we reject the quota policy and positive discrimination, it is already expressed in favor of women or even the alleged social minorities.The minority policy, by subtracting importance from the deep unity of the human family, in order to establish superficial divisions, dangerously threatens the cohesion of the social body and the balance of our democratic model.On the one hand, if we set fees for women, why we would not establish quotas attending age or ethnicity, Catholics, workers, people who wear glasses.The application of social quotas in favor of the most modest categories would not be more crazy than the creation of fees for women.With this philosophy, it would no longer be necessary to organize either elections or administrative competitions.It would be enough to determine the composition of the ministries and the chambers through a statistical calculation.The quota policy can only increase the little interest of the voters with respect to politics, and would give them the impression that everything happens behind them.On the other hand, this policy demonstrates a deep contempt for women.It is not because of the mechanical game of a certain quota that women must access the performance of political or administrative functions, but through the recognition of their own merit and skills.Ladies, would they be so little pride to be willing to carry a ministerial portfolio or a girdle of deputy for the mathematical contingency of a quota?Women are worth much more than a quota.It is restoring the principle of ""meritocracy"" as we will improve in quantity and quality the presence of women in the decision -making process.I want to thank Mrs. Minister and Mrs. Commissioner her interventions and the important statements they have made before the European Parliament on a crucial issue as the one we discussed today.The presence of women in decision -making positions is first and foremost a matter of democracy.It is necessary that all citizens, men and women be recognized, feel really represented by their chosen ones and their rulers."	es
For this reason, we give a cordial welcome to these programs.I would like to refer to the positions of the Employment and Social Affairs Commission in regards to the greatest of community initiatives, that is, Interreg III.It is necessary that in the framework of Interreg III a considerable number of social measures can also be promoted given the fact that 50% of the unemployment in the Union is structurally conditioned and in view of the especially sensitive situation that is recorded in the border territories - I want to refer only to possible unwanted migratory movements - this is not only reasonable, but also imperative.However, the measures susceptible to promotion mentioned in Annex II of the orientation A seem to promise a lot in this regard.However, in the communication of the Commission, instructions are completely missing to the Member States containing these integrated approaches of aspects of social policy and employment policy.For this reason I would like to refer in a special way to the progressive adoption of professional training measures, especially in areas that are affected by a high degree of long -term unemployment and youth unemployment.The B orientation should also be open to employment policy promotion measures, especially in connection with the introductory strategy for adhesion candidates.In relation to employment policy measures, it seems necessary to compose the mixed cooperation committee at the regional level because only at the regional level the experience and familiarity that are precisely necessary for these measures are given so that they do not fade into something abstract.We can criticize always that in Interreg it is still excessive - as I think too - the administrative trajín, but we must always criticize it, although this almost seems inevitable in the case of the commission's promotion programs.However, I would like to indicate that this is fatal precisely here.Precisely for the employment policy we should tend to measures as simple as possible so that the social dimension acquires again in this EU the importance that corresponds to it.Mr. President, the Regional Policy Commission, Transport and Tourism considered, among other things, the Report on Leader+ and, in this sense, agreed to support the decentralization process in the management of the actions, considering that such a process may be effective if two conditions are respected: that the local action groups are representative of the general interests of the local community and that the control mechanisms of the commission are used to prevent the territorial and local political powers from using the resourcesLeader+ to maintain organizations and civil groups related to power.It is requested that in the decision -making bodies of the projects, an equal representation of three components is guaranteed: political representatives and public administrations, companies and economic operators, and social actors, including unions and non -governmental organizations.And it is especially underlined that, in all these organs, there must be a balanced representation of men and women.	es
It is for this reason that the Commission presented in November 1998 a proposal for a directive on the information-consultation of workers.We thank the Parliament for the support he has given to this proposal since that time.Unfortunately, more than a year after the presentation of the proposal, the other branch of the legislative power, the Council, has still not started working on this proposal.I hope that this debate will help remind Member States the importance and urgency of this initiative.We recently heard the Portuguese presidency declare that a serious debate would soon be launched on this proposal.The next presidency, which will be exercised by France, also seems willing to grant this file the priority it deserves.The Commission sincerely hopes that the Parliament and the Council will quickly finalize this important file which constitutes, in its eyes, the most effective response to the concerns raised by cases such as that which brings us here today.Regarding the involvement of employees at the transnational level, there are certain indications of at least one case of infringement of transnational agreements in terms of consultation and information concluded between companies and European work.The companies concerned may have taken part of certain ambiguities of the legal and contractual framework in force.The commission will contact the relevant national authorities to see what it is.In any case, I would like to make anyone who believes they have been flouted in their rights that they have the appropriate means of enforcing the law and obtaining compensation, in particular through relevant national jurisdictional bodies.The Commission heard the request of the Parliament to carry out an immediate revision of the European Business Committees Directive.As indicated by the report it will adopt in the coming weeks, the Commission admits that the directive presents certain shortcomings.Nevertheless, as my colleague has already pointed out, Commissioner Diamantopoulou, on various other occasions, the decision to immediately revise a directive is not easily taken.It depends on various considerations.First, a revision of the directive would have little immediate effect on existing agreements, unless the fundamental principle of respecting the autonomy of the parties continues to be applied.Then, an immediate revision would risk delaying the progress of other pending files in this area, such as that of the European Anonymous Company and the proposal on national information-consultation.The success of these other files could greatly facilitate the subsequent revision of the CEE directive and even bring some possibilities of solution to the problems identified above.This is why the Commission thinks rather that it would be better, in this context, to revise the directive on European corporate committees after having completed these two other files and after having evaluated the application of the directive.The revision does not stop at legislation alone.To encourage and support dialogue, as a cornerstone of a successful change, the Commission is putting into practice the recommendations of the Lillehammer report by preparing the creation of a European industrial change observatory.	fr
The districts in which these people live should benefit from these projects.If we succeed in three priorities with our determination, then I think that these families, these people, these European citizens will believe more in Europe, and this is ultimately crucial, because the cities play an increasing role in European life.Mr President, before my colleagues Franz Fischler and Anna Diamantopoulou have their say - after all, we had all three that we are responsible for these four community initiatives, the opportunity to pursue the debate with the same attention - I would like to devote myself to Urban and Interreg.Many of them spoke to this topic and commented on it.First of all, I would like to express the rapporteurs of the committees, all committees, but also to the speakers of the political groups and each and each of them for the quality of their contributions and the interest in these two initiatives.This applies in particular to the explanations of Ms. Arlene McCarthy to Urban, and I would like to express my thanks not only for her work and the report she presented, but also, and why should I not mention this too, for what we owe to her, as well as for what we are generally owe to her parliament.I will not forget that the European Parliament will maintain this initiative to renew the crisis -related districts and to promote permanent urban development, which at the same time comprises and desired the integrated approach to cope with the economic, social and ecological problems.There is also agreement, as Ms. Arlene McCarthy explained in her report, with regard to the effectiveness of this instrument, which results from the financial concentration and the critical mass for the interventions, with regard to the horizontal mechanism, which in our opinion is particularly suitable for the spread of the results and the intensification of the exchange of experiences and proven procedures, and finally the growing importance of local authoritiesthe program development and implementation based on a solid partnership.After I remember the matches between the commission's proposals and their parliament and pointed out the interest with which I have followed the contributions, I would like to go into some expressed reviews and suggestions and apologize in advance not to be able to mention any speaker personally.I am still convinced that everyone recognizes each other.First of all, I would like to go into the Urban program and its upper limit of 50 cities, which some of them described as arbitrary.I can understand your concerns.Therefore, I have instructed my departments to adapt to a reasonable increase in the number of cities that are eligible in the context of urban.This requires certain guarantees regarding the concentration - I think especially of 10,000 inhabitants - and the critical financial mass in exceptional areas: We have to remain at 500 euros per inhabitant so that the intervention of the European Union is also effective and visible and is not perceived as a distribution according to the watering can principle that citizens and communities can no longer be able to understand.	de
Asking such conditions in these conditions for this element, as does paragraph 20, contributes to the excesses of irresponsible and ideological budget to which the assembly is used to.Finally, we note the will manifested both in the document of the Commission and in the report of the honorable Decourrière to use Interreg for peace and reconstruction in the Balkans: I do not believe that the structural funds must serve to repair the damage inflicted by the Americans to Serbia during the criminal and ineffective bombings.It would be up to Washington, and not to us, take responsibility for a conflict unleashed to serve his only interests.For these reasons, the French delegation of our group has not been able to support the Decourrière report, choosing to refrain at the time of the final vote.Procacci Report (A5-0025/2000) Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Procaccio report on rural development, not only because I share the leading program in its most important lines but also because it is the other side of the Urban program, of which we spoke earlier.As the elderly in the cities are very alone, the elderly in rural areas are becoming the only population, because young people go to the city: the lights fascinate them, also the breweries, and the countryside and rural areas remain empty.I therefore believe that it is very important that this project of the European Union finds everyone's support and is further enhanced.The Leader +Community initiative, while giving continuity to the previous ones, presents some particularities.First, the reduction of about half of the funds available, although the period is longer.In the meantime, new objectives have been included, in particular the financing of the Natura 2000 network and all rural regions become eligible.Although this community initiative is aimed at rural development, it is unacceptable that it does not coherently deal with agriculture and agricultural production.Without agriculture, the rural world does not exist and consequently any rural development strategy must be based on the endogenous potential of agriculture while increasing other activities, upstream and downstream, to avoid the desertification of the rural world.For this reason, we considered it essential to improve the relationship with the proposals that we have presented to expressly include agricultural activity and farmers in the rural development strategy, to urge an increase in funds in order not to compromise the continuation of the program in the rural regions previously contemplated as well as to argue that the new program must continue to privilege the most disadvantaged regions.Our position towards leader is the result of our general evaluation of the overall agricultural policy conducted by the Union.Both leader 1, and leader 2, applied in the nineties, represented an essential component of the new PAC resulting from the 1992 reform and, jointly with other individual measures, constituted the so -called second pillar of the rural development policy implemented by the Union.Their real objective was to alleviate and conceal the ruinous consequences of the new PAC, as well as disoriently disorientate small and medium -sized farmers, and certainly not to develop rural areas and to maintain the agricultural population, as instead it was proclaimed, with hypocrisy, among the objectives of these programs.	it
However, I would like to prevent them from the illusion that incoherence is the product of some kind of mechanical deficiency of the system.It can be, but that incoherence is nothing more than a small part of what we are discussing now.Most of these inconsistencies have to do with known and well established differences of interests between men and women, etc., and there is the problem.Mr. Mulder has said that no farmer will begin to produce anything whose price is too low.That is true as regards the part of the world in which we live, but our associates and beneficiaries of Africa have a slightly different perspective.In those countries it is cultivated, not only to make a living, but to live, and that is the difference.Subsistence agriculture is not based on any price calculation, it is based on the hope that it rains during the next station.That does not apply to all agriculture of developing countries but to agriculture aimed at reducing poverty for which we have to intervene more and better than until now.From that point of view what I am saying is very pertinent.Other issues have been mentioned: livestock in Namibia, tomatoes and powdered milk in the Caribbean.Let's not small due to excess masochism.There is a limit to the usefulness of everything.All cases mentioned are characterized by the fact that we have dealt with them.Intervention prices have been regulated, and the problems we had with cattle in Western Africa and Namibia resolved reducing support for intervention.They were real problems, but we have all solved them.As for the question of cocoa, or chocolate, I repeat that in 5% it has to do with the creation of a basis of life in neighboring countries.What we are talking about is from the local cocoa nuts that are so important to the people that harvest them to make a living with them in Burkina Faso as the coconuts for Ghana farmers.This is not a clear case of incoherence, it is rather a case of competition between suppliers.What has been said about sugar in the Caribbean is more complicated.Within the framework of overseas countries and territories, the accumulation of some of these commercial aspects represents a complicated problem, but it may very well happen that what we are mentioning here has more to do with the promotion of the interests of some European companies than with the generation of income in the Caribbean.Be that as it may, it is a matter that we are occupying.I have promised to try to create due balance in all these issues and I will allow myself to mention the achievement of the Cooperation and Commercial Development Agreement with South Africa.I will say with any modesty that this example is something that indicates that the Commission is willing to make a supplementary effort to achieve coherence between the perspective of cooperation for the development and perspective of commercial interests.There is no doubt that we have done everything that corresponded to solve this problem, and I sincerely hope that we now have a period of peace of mind and peaceful application in the coming years of that agreement.	es
"And this requires generating a growth dynamic that guarantees, for the whole European Union, an average annual growth rate maintained at least 3%.I think that it is therefore necessary to stimulate a culture of dynamism and business initiative and a culture of reinforcement of social cohesion.All this is absolutely necessary: ​​technological change and institutional reforms.If it is necessary to learn more quickly from good practices, it is also to create new adequate practices and innovate in political methodology.And Europe, of course, today has the institutional processes organized to develop these policies, achieve an economy and above all a society based on innovation and knowledge, through the design of a European policy for the Information and Knowledge Society, the construction of an educational society at European scale and the development of a European space of science and technology open to the world.Concluding, Mr. President, a combination of policies that promote growth and employment must be guaranteed, ensure macroeconomic stability and euro consolidation;that promote growth and transition to a society and an economy of innovation and knowledge.Through the role of structural policies and reforms, at the service of citizens, we will have a closer Europe and, of course, also a stronger Europe.Mr. President, I would like to join all the congratulations on the ambitions of the Portuguese presidency at this extraordinary summit.I am above all the intention of reaching a real coordination of socioeconomic policy throughout its size.However, I would like to ask that attention be paid to three specific points.The first point is the theme of ""Corporate Government"".The Portuguese presidency has explicitly put on the agenda the social dimension of innovation, but it seems to me that this dimension is too far from intentions regarding the promotion of new companies.In my opinion, that social dimension must be integrated into that new European company, be it a large multinational or one of these small emerging ICT companies.Therefore, I would like to reopen the debate about the ""Corporate Government"" on the broader concept of the company as ""Stakeholders Society"" including the role of social interlocutors and all those involved.On the last page of the Presidency document I find the proposition of launching a ""Observatory for Industrial Change"".I predict a great role for this ""observatory"" and I would like this to be addressed with energy and I would like to ask UNICE, the organization of European businessmen, to show a little more of ""commitment"" and greater enthusiasm.It has bothered that in their documents for this summit they have presented mainly requests for requests to the administrations but that they have not highlighted their own ""commitment"" and their role throughout the process.It seems to me that you have to give one of lime and another of sand: they should collaborate with these activities.Another point that I would like to mention briefly is fiscal coordination, because I think it does not give me time to address the three points."	es
However, before the opening of the debates or when suspending the session, nothing prevents the tent for the tent to admire, free of charge, the magnificent show that apparently hides behind her.I am pleased that the assembly is illuminated by the richness of the debates, however, in my opinion, it would be even better if, from so much so, the sun could shine directly on the classroom. It would therefore be a welcome thing if she could check with the shop assistants the opportunity to open this tent occasionally.Thanks, honorable colleague.I am grateful to every suggestion that aims to make our meeting room more livable.I would like to make you the following proposal: for the moment we continue the work in the room as it is.In the meantime, we will check if this is technically feasible.If this were the case, we will do a half hour test to see what effect the president has the backlight.Oicvm Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, I trust that Parliament is ready to make a decision that will strengthen the European financial market today.As a new deputy to the European Parliament, I found extremely interesting and instructive to take care of the responsibility of such an important issue.I want to thank in particular my colleagues in the Commission for their availability for compromise, for the attention shown by the President and by the Presidency Office towards the complexity of the subject, for the good contacts established with the Commission, not least with the Commission, and with the Council, as well as for the work done with dedication by the secretariat of the parliamentary commission.In commission the degree of Concordia was remarkable, except on a point for which I trust that a solution can be found.The issue of OICVMs can be considered technically complex and politically risky.I think some do not even know the meaning of this abbreviation.However, allow me to clarify in no uncertain terms that is a question such as to really involve the European citizen, because it concerns the way in which their savings are administered, the possibilities of choice existing, the methods of competition between the various countries on the different forms of savings, the needs of the saver on safety and the optional savings opportunities offered to European citizens in anticipation of old age.These are all themes that require a skilful balance between liberalization needs for a better market and greater returns, on the one hand, and of protection and safety of investors, on the other.During the 1980s, most European markets experienced a drastic deregulation process.This had as a result of an impetuous development, which lasted a few years, of the monetary and bonds at national level.Collective investment funds have become an alternative to bank saving.In my country, over 60 percent of the Swedes, he placed his savings in funds of various kinds.The managed savings guarantees a certain security thanks to the entity of the investments made by the funds.The capital and investment securities market has not ceased to expand and the OICVM directive currently the vigor has now become overcome and no longer in step with the times.	it
In my opinion, this evaluation is opposed to a framework of economic stagnation and poor growth - equal, for the 90s, only at 1.9 percent annual, despite some peaks that we have not been able to consolidate.Consequently, if we do not want to relive the failures of the past, we must exploit the current situation to improve economic performance and promote a new transition policy towards higher growth levels of our economy.Here is the challenge that awaits us.In this regard, the Commission has essentially suggested that we maintain us on our positions passed in relation to economic policy, limiting ourselves to establishing the fundamental tax and monetary principles for our economy by watching with confidence in the markets and hoping in a miracle on their part without predicting further interventions by conscious social actors.In Europe, according to the rapporteur, this is precisely the attitude that made us fail in the past - and not only once, but repeatedly - and involves the risks of downsizing that the Ecofin Council is currently discussing.Among these risks there is the correction of the US economy and the future trend of oil prices and long -term interest rates of the Union.If one of these risks materialize how will we reply?With greater liberalism or better preparation than when the last drop has occurred?My proposal asked Parliament to suggest an active economic policy in two ways.On the one hand he recommended to adopt the excellent econometric analyzes of the Commission and to ask the Council to transform them into an action plan that provided for some objectives quantifiable and connected to each other in relation to the levels of employment and economic growth, objectives that transformed our commitment into an operational and credible policy of full employment.One of the main axes of this plan was to be the increase in the level of investment in the creation of capital from 19 percent - share reached during the last decade - at least 23-24 percent of GDP, both in the public and private sector.In order to allow the public sector to take the initiative in investment policy, the Council should have sacrificed some of its most sacred cows.He should have reviewed his negative attitude towards the large infrastructure programs of transeur European networks, who remained to take dust in the drawers for too long, allow these programs to be adequately financed through the EU bonds, and to accept an interpretation of the concept of budget deficit that would allow governments to contract for investments without remaining victims of the restrictions on the stability pact.This was the first fundamental aspect of my proposal.The second aspect consisted in embracing a large number of structural reform proposals, privatization and deregulation and facilitating the transition to an economy based on knowledge that, as we know, constitutes the foundation of the proposals of the presidency for the Lisbon summit.The experts said several times that the structural reform plan in conjunction with an investment expansion program and growth could awaken the European economy from its state of inertia, while unilateral policies are destined to fail.	it
"It is also about very specific things like transport capacities.These things must be coordinated faster in the European Union.Another example: the big cattle death in Mongolia.We know that Tacis and Echo Gelder are present in the European Union.But why don't we help?Because there are too many bureaucratic obstacles.The foreign representation of the European Union must better take our needs in a stronger future European foreign policy.In short, the focus is on the operational implementation.Relationships with Russia are very important.We must not be behind the criticism of the Chechnya policy of Russia.To our extraordinary regret, we have to find out that the freedom of the press in Russia has not yet been guaranteed.We had invited the journalist Babitzki to us for next Thursday, but the Russian authorities did not leave him out.I hope that the European Commission, on the other hand, has energetic protest from the Russian authorities.President, Mr. President of the Commission, if a parliament debates priorities in the legislative process, everything becomes priority.For me there are the most important priorities in employment and thus in economic growth, as well as in quality of life and thus in environmental protection, in food safety and consumer rights.I would now like to make some explanations about the economic and social area.One of the initiatives of the Commission, which is a high priority, is the E-Europe initiative.We debated Europe's economic and social renewal yesterday about the summit in Lisbon.In doing so, I asked for common growth goals so that we can achieve full employment.Full employment does not mean the complete end of all forms of unemployment, because economic unemployment, employees who want to change the position, young people who are looking for an initial will always exist.However, full employment has been achieved if there is no longer a long -term unemployed if each young person is at least offered a training opportunity six months after entering the labor market.This is possible if we invest more in what Mr. Guterres described yesterday as ""human capital"", i.h.in basic training and then above all in the lifelong training.In this context, the E-Europe initiative is just right.In the future, the jobs will have an increasing computer science component.But in this area we lack experts, as in the USA.Therefore, the American Senate has approved a total of 500,000 visas within a period of four years for highly qualified foreign workers.We have to train our own experts and ensure that they stay in Europe.In a commission document it has been found that half of the young academics who complete a postgraduate degree in the USA will stay there.In order to keep our experts here to attract the best experts to train more, we have to invest massively in research and development.The only two countries that invest a larger part of their GDP in research and development than the USA, i.e.h.Finland and Sweden are also the only two European countries that can compete with the Americans in the area of ​​communication technologies.That would be an example to which the other European countries could follow!"	de
How to explain to the workers victims of the rationalizations of the world monopoly that must be willing to change several times ex officio in their working life, when the great company captains, after having lost the blow of a fate of an Over Take, leave with compensation of 30 million euros?For years we have been repeated that the economy must be liberalized.In the liberalized sectors, we attend an avalanche of mergers and acquisitions that inevitably leads to monopolistic situations.All these stock market battles are only built on advances of growth of the benefits of 15%, 20%, 25%, that is, unreal levels in its duration.The uncontrolled increase in financial and real estate assets means that the risks are also rising.The main risk that lurks us in the medium term is not inflation, but the deflation caused by a sinking of speculative bubbles in international financial markets.I finish, Madam President, saying that the next five years will be crucial.New rules for globalization are needed, investments in the real economy are needed in man;It is necessary that the visible hand of the states, the visible hand of the commission guarantee the social dimension of the market economy.Mrs. President, Mr. President of the Commission, Commissioners, Dear and Dear colleagues, the strategic program presents, in my view, two obvious weak points.It is useless to write a new economic and social program without having exhausted the old one.Specifically, I mean transport policy or regional policy.In both areas you have excellent commissioners in the people of the colleague Palacio and Colega Barnier, but still grants them too little importance in their strategic document.Why do I say it?In the case of transport policy, it is decisive that it is defined at the scale of the European Union with a rational approach from the economic point of view and environmental policy, and this must be done before the adhesion of new states.If the president of the commission would like to listen to me, I would be very grateful, but I see that I will have to resign myself.I will cite three examples.First, we need a reasonable liberalization of the railway sector, since we want to move the transport of goods from the railroad roads.This is reasonable from the economic point of view and environmental policy.Without a liberalization it will not be possible to advance in the development of a reasonable transport policy.The same can be said in relation to the field of air security in Europe.Citizens cannot understand that we liberalize air transport, but instead we have divided the airspace into 15 different sectors, controlled at national level, with the consequent economic disadvantages for airlines and environmental pollution.In this aspect he still has pending tasks.Mr. Commissioner, regional policy is too little present in your document.The EU social and economic cohesion is a decisive task of the community.If we do not comply, the citizens of the disadvantaged regions will fear the extension.We must clearly tell them that for the next five years we will promote their approximation to the richest regions, dedicating reasonable resources to support for disadvantaged regions.	es
The fixed point remains.The fixed point is the means.Well, you stand here in front of a parliament, of which some members still live in the memory of what I would like to describe it, that is, white book syndrome, that is, the great initiative of Jacques Delors that failed on the bookholders of the Ecofin Council.We do not want them to move the same misfortune today, because the project they propose is so promising that he can do a thrust and that Europe can offer those from our colleague Goebbel's future perspective.However, they need the necessary funds that, as I fear, will be missing a little today.So your task is to get the necessary funds, but this will not be possible within the narrow framework of the Agenda 2000.So you will have to make your colleagues take care of the financing of the suggestions that you will submit to us.An example among many - and this is one of the important measures you have proposed - concerns the information and knowledge society.Without a doubt - and you have explained this clearly - the social gap is an essential problem that we have to fight.Digital gap must not be added as I would like to describe them.Who do you want to offer this information and knowledge society?An increasingly older or older population, a population that is still poor despite everything, and an unfortunately less and less well -trained population?So you have to start at the base if this knowledge society is not to be limited to the profit striving for some successful start-ups that are absolutely necessary.But that is probably not the goal they pursue.Unfortunately, an area is missing in your program, namely the public services.Public services have played an important role in the history of our European social model.Today we no longer live in the time of the monopolis, and the commission has initiated a process of liberalization in a number of public sectors to open to the competition in order to modernize them and make them more efficient.However, we must not stop.Now it has to be determined more precisely what the most important public service tasks will exist in this context of the competition and the information society, which are to be fulfilled by the state and private companies of this sector.In this regard, more sustainable measures are required, which are not yet included in the commission's work program, which they could give an impetus: In my opinion, an extremely important signal would be set.This knowledge society is finally based on research and development, and at this point I would like to welcome the initiative taken by the Commission to create a European research area.However, the Commission and Parliament need the advice so that this European research area can be equipped with the necessary means.The supporting program is not enough, it must be further equipped and changed in its most important objectives.This is an extensive work, but we rely on you.President, Mr. Council President, Mr President, Dear colleagues!President of the Council, they spoke of a political deficit.	de
"The renovation of companies belongs to the principle of free determination of investments, and must therefore be defended.However, events in clear contrast with these principles occur more and more often.Among these, today there is a case that, apparently, may seem sectoral and not significant but which, if made to pass without any authoritative intervention by the European Union, will become an unwritten rule that will put in difficulty many Member States and the Union as a whole.An American industry - the Goodyear - with productive locations in Italy, Germany, England, is, from its point of view legitimately, reviewing its production and dislocation.However, he is doing it, however, not respecting the community rules on the matter: certainly, not giving reasonable preparation and not taking care of the obligation to realize the use of public, Italian and European funding.In Italy, Goodyear is not proceeding, commissioner Liikanen, renovated, but the closure of a factory that, with its production, covers 14 percent of the market and that Goodyear itself defined ""higher qualification of its workers"", a factory that has been opened by investing European money for a total of 85 million euros.Closing without notice, therefore, and without any will to discuss the fate of the factory and its workers, despite the fact that with the public funds used in that factory there is little private and a lot of public.It would be serious if every non -European company learned, in fact, to use Europe as a bus, where you do not pay the ticket, you do not pay the collaboration, you collect for using the vehicle and goes away without realizing anyone.Europe must guarantee freedom in every form, including that of using their money for its own purposes of freedom, not to make it use to others at will, others who claim to collect and refuse the comparison, at the time of divorce, also on the same way as divorce, it being understood that here it is a divorce declared unilaterally.Commissioner Liikanen spoke a few indeed of renovation that must not be made ignorant.In this case, unfortunately, he ignores those who suffer it and appears that whoever implements it ignore.The commissioner Liikanen want to further specify that it is not easy to come to the national courts.Of course, it is always possible to do it, but when the jobs have been lost, when the industries have been closed, to go the courts, with slow justice such as the Italian one, leads to a result that is certainly not comforting.Commissioner Liikanen, we expect authoritative intervention.Of course we expect, as Parliament, to be able to collaborate in that resolution to which you have mentioned - we are very ready - but we expect authoritative intervention on this story, which certainly cannot end and pass as it is now almost passed.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, for the second time in four months we discuss the renovation of companies in Europe.Today as then the starting point for the debate is offered by the reorganization of large companies, combined with the loss of jobs."	it
"For this, Bergen arises important community initiatives - which our commission has always supported - tending to reconstitute the biomass of the breeders, reduce and adapt fishing efforts to resources, protect youth, species and their habitats and the adoption of technical measures aimed at selective and responsible fishing.These aspects are key to the future of fishing, along with effective control systems.But we must not get carried away by maximalisms in this field, as Mr. Katiforis had initially raised in his report.I refer to it now because I will not have time to intervene later.I want to point out in that sense that the numerous amendments presented and approved in our commission and the flexibility shown by Mr. Katiforis allowed the approval of their report in our commission.Chance, destiny, they wanted precisely that in this same plenary they coincide my report and that of Mr. Katiforis about fishing and the environment and, at the same time, the oral question of our commission - which we will examine tomorrow - about the very serious consequences for the fishing of an oil company, the Erika.Maritime transport and industrial and urban pollution, waste, negatively affect fishing.Their problems do not come only from overfishing.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Fischler.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11.00.Fishing and conservation management of nature in the marine environment In accordance with the agenda, the report on the report (A5-0017/2000) of Mr. Katiforis, on behalf of the Fisheries Commission, on the communication of the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament ""Management of Fishing and Conservation of Nature in the Marine environment"" (Com (1999) 363 -C5-01761999/2155 (cos))..(En) In the past this assembly has discussed the problems of resource management and environmental protection in the fishing sector.This particular communication communication is part of the general strategy of the Commission to improve the integration of environmental considerations in other community policies.The general strategy of the commission is to direct fishing activities towards sustainable levels both economically and environmentally through the management of scarce resources, so that the exhaustion produced by overexploitation and/or environmental degradation is prevented.The alternative for successful management lies in the reduction of the fishing industry as resources decrease and the demand for fishing products is increasingly covered by imports.I know that in a Spanish newspaper I have been described as an enemy of the fishing industry because I have said such things.Of course, I am only an enemy of the fishing industry to the extent that someone who recommends not to cut the branch on which it is sitting is.This is an advisable policy.In particular, communication appeals to the control of fishing pressure to benefit commercial reserves and marine systems, to the improvement of measures for the conservation of nature in the marine environment, to a gradual management of coastal areas, a better training, to informative transparency and to a greater contribution of scientific research to fishing management.All these priorities will be persecuted on community scale and in several international forums in which the community participates."	es
We need common, interregional and transnational organs in which all local and regional bodies as well as all economic and social actors are actively involved.Parallel projects that are developed on both sides of the border must no longer exist.We have to create a cross -border culture, and in the area of ​​administrative cooperation, innovative concepts are necessary with which the existing limits and the difficulties can be overcome due to the different regulations of responsibilities in the individual member states, regions and municipalities.It must not happen that a project cannot be carried out due to communication problems.In the discussion in the committee, we also found that there are problems to coordinate Interreg with other financing instruments such as Meda, Tacis or Phares that run over a year or two.In his draft decision, the parliament attaches great importance to the fact that these problems are solved, it submits solutions to the Commission and sets reasonable deadlines to carry out the necessary changes.Mr. President, the reason for my speech in this pronunciation can be seen in the fact that the urban initiative is quite successful, especially in Ireland.Therefore, I am very vehemently advocated that the European Union continues its contribution in this area.It is a sad fact that hundreds, if not thousands of communities in the European Union, have to suffer from extreme poverty and disadvantage.Even in very wealthy Member States and large cities, a variety of people in ghettos live under inadequate living conditions, the level of education is low, the physical infrastructure is underdeveloped, and drug addiction and everything that is related.I believe that the European Union must support the Member States to prove that it can be helpful in the support of European citizens, and also that the Union is doing something for these citizens and their families.The program was extremely successful in Ireland, and of course I also know about his success in other countries.In the beginning you only progressed with small steps, and this slowness moved that it was necessary to have the local population developed these programs yourself.It is very important that you incorporate your own initiative and your own expertise on the local conditions into the development of this initiative.It would be very easy to have these programs worked out quickly and on time by external specialists, but this approach would question the whole meaning of the urban program.Before I come to the end, I would like to address another point: We should insist that where the funds flow and where this program is worked out, everything is done in the context of a serious development policy under Urban.Unfortunately, this is not the case in Ireland.I welcome the innovative approach of the Equal program and the aim of integrating discriminated population groups into the labor market.I think the development partnerships are a very clever concept, even if they have experimental character.However, I have two important concerns about the development partnerships.They should also be made accessible to smaller groups so that they can develop, implement and monitor the programs.We need a high degree of flexibility for this program.In the past, I have repeatedly pointed out that a simple language must be used instead of technical jargon so that intelligibility is guaranteed for everyone.	de
The Brok report is an excellent tool in this sense;In fact, it is deplorable that, since it is a public debate, it is influenced by the political position assumed by the Council and Commission and cannot be said more than this excellent report.In any case, future developments depend not only on you, but also on us to the extent that we supply you with decisions and opportunities.Returning to the Brok, Cyprus and Malta report are the latest islands in the Mediterranean and, if I am not mistaken, of the whole of Europe that has not yet entered the union.This has a symbolic value since the Mediterranean and its islands - I am also an island - constitute the region where those who live there and those who come from northern Europe to spend their holidays meet them.From this point of view, the island of Aphrodite, as is called Cyprus, and the pirate island, as we call Malta benevolently, are two pearls and must soon be integrated into the union.They boast high incomes and excellent commercial relations and, ultimately, will be the test bench to judge the political will of the Union.In conclusion, I have no reason to further dilute the unanimity that reigns in the classroom, but I just want to make a note to the president in office for the Council.I think his intervention was not impeccable, but I hope it was a translation error and I await his reply to get an answer.Mr President, honorable parliamentarians, I listened very carefully to your interventions and especially some rather emphatic statements on the Cypriot question, in defense of what is today the legality in Cyprus and that the European Union obviously recognizes, given that it recognizes the resolutions of the United Nations Security Council in this regard.In this regard, honorable Wurtz, there are no ambiguous silences from the Council: it assumes the full responsibility for the interpretation that gives the existing situation in Cyprus.Moreover, this situation and this interpretation were pushing him to adopt in Luxembourg at the end of 1997 the decision we know, and to take the first steps in the process of adhesion of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union.Regardless of a more or less emotional position of nature on this kind of issues, I would like you to realize that the routine of international negotiations usually force governments - and when I say governments I mean all governments - to give a slightly more flexible interpretation.It is true that we need more emotional position to project the issues we deal with human level, but we must also realize that it is thanks to the rationality of political positions and the negotiating flexibility that you can find solutions that allow to overcome the great disputes that have given rise to the tragedies of the past.Leaving aside the culprits - we are in fact not here to make an inventory of the culprits, the resolutions of the United Nations are clear in this regard -, I think we must exploit, without emotion and with greater rationality, the opportunities that the new situation offers us.	it
The sixth report of the European Commission draws very precious conclusions.I will summarize two, which have already been recalled by the rapporteur, one positive, the other negative.The first is that significant progress has been made in terms of territorial and social cohesion throughout the territory of the Union and that the community funds have played an important, although not decisive role, in the reduction of regional inequalities.The negative is that the considerable effort that has been made has proven more effective with regard to bringing together the GDP and productivity of European regions than in terms of its employment levels.It is therefore necessary to better coordinate structural financing and the creation of workstations.It is, Mr. Commissioner, the first mandate for the next period.I therefore ask, Mr. President, to my illustrious colleagues to approve this report and I ask the Commission, as did other colleagues, that it does not lose sight of the conclusions of its sixth periodic report with regard to the programming of the period 2000-2006.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his excellent work and also for the way in which the amendments' proposals were taken into consideration during the committee exam.The sixth periodic report provides a basis on which to assess the achievement of the European Union regional policy.The report shows that, despite all the efforts, the growth is uneven.Extremely rapid growth continues in central Europe.Likewise, the most dynamic centers are constantly growing faster than the European average, while many regions in the north and southern Europe experience significantly slower growth.An in -depth analysis of the reasons which make regional policy not give the expected results in all regions is now necessary.Is the reason for bureaucracy?Or the regional disparities - distances, too hot or too cold climate, dispersed habitat, rigorous conditions - have not taken enough taken into account?How can the European Union face the challenges of evolution on the planetary scale so that the less well developed regions can keep pace?It would also be important to analyze the effects of expansion on structural funds and the development of the most remote regions.Member States also have their share of responsibility in this area and they must not forget it.Some Member States have contravened the principle of subsidiarity and reduced regional resources to the national level, while the regional aid provided by the European Union was increasing.This had a harmful effect on the results of regional policy.It will also be necessary to think in the future of setting up indicators to target the measures at the right time and in the right place.For example, the uncontrolled migratory flow was not sufficiently taken into account.In this regard too, there is reason to emphasize the decisive role of SMEs as suppliers of jobs and engines of regional development.It is particularly important to put new technologies and know-how available to companies in developing regions.Our group is favorable to the adoption of this report.Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, the territorial policy of the European Community has so far made it possible to significantly translate the residents of income of the inhabitants.	fr
So, Mrs. President, I repeat that for our part we have discussed the action program for the next five years and that we are ready to present it when Parliament wants - even this week, if it decides this sense - while next month it will be up to the program for 2000, exactly as it had been established.President President, I hear some laughs in the socialists.I was told that even a conspicuous part of the socialist group would like this point to be withdrawn from the agenda, as in the vote during the conference of the presidents, the vote of the working group of the competent colleagues of the socialist group was missing.I don't know if this information is correct, but we of the ppe-de would still be grateful if the aforementioned point was eliminated since the parliament has already dealt with repeatedly the matter.There are also some decisions against this tax.For this reason, the Ppe-de group asks that the point in question be withdrawn from the agenda.Thank you, Honorable Poettering.The honorable Wurtz who intervenes against the request has the right.Mrs. President, I would first like to underline the lack of logic by the Honorable Poettering who has just made the morality to the socialist group for returning to a decision approved by the conference of presidents with a clear majority.Well, he did the same thing.It had been discussed and everyone had said they agree, except the Ppe-de group and the Eldr group.In this circumstance - the honorable colleagues will remember him - I had also underlined that the point was not so much to know if we are in favor or against the Tobin tax, but if we have the courage to listen to what the Commission and the Council think.It is not asking much.Therefore, the proposal to keep the oral question to the Council and the Commission, to learn, once and for all, the position of the two institutions on a relatively modest proposal, but which would launch an important signal to public opinion, especially on the wave of the emotion aroused by the failure of the Seattle conference, to the age of day.I now put the request of the PPE-De group to vote intended to withdraw the oral question on the property tax from the agenda.(Parliament rejects the request with 164 votes in favor, 166 against and 7 abstentions) Lady president, I thank the honorable poetter for the unexpected publicity that has just given this discussion.Thank you!Lady President, my vote was counted, who has not been electronically deposited, why don't I have the card?My vote was favorable.In fact, if we add the votes of the two colleagues who intervened, the result ... Lady president, the presidency has already announced the outcome of the vote.Changes are not allowed.Lady President, I state that I will respect his decision, but during the previous vote on the question of the commission's strategic plan I had expressed the intention to intervene on behalf of my group before the vote, but I did not have the opportunity.I would be very grateful to you if before closing this point on the agenda it allowed me to release a declaration of vote on behalf of my group.	it
Mr President, I am not a friend of Milosevic and his government.Nevertheless, I have great doubts about the legitimization of NATO's mission against Yugoslavia in the Kosovo conflict, on the one hand because of the lack of a decision by the UN Security Council, on the other hand, because I think that this effort could have been avoided if you had not made any unfulfilled demands with regard to the sovereignty of Serbia.Cleaning of Serbs and Roma speaks for itself. Should NATO not at least admit its mistake and take responsibility for the intentional bombing of the Belgrader television station and the death of over 20 civilian journalists, because this is still a difficult moral flaw and may now become a shameful charges against our westernLead state and government heads?Mr. MP!As far as the point of view of the European Union is concerned, there is no selective assessment, interpretation and analysis of what military goals are, in particular the measures against a certain type of infrastructures that served as a support for Mr. Milosevic's political and propaganda system.Therefore, I cannot tell you whether we agreed with a specific NATO campaign or not.They belong to an overall plan that we agree with.Some of these actions may be questionable, and some were even described by NATO as unfortunate.Others can be justified with tactical reasons, i.e.h.You should prevent Mr. Milosevic from continuing his domestic propaganda campaign.In any case, on behalf of the Council, I would not like to hand over any value judgment about a certain NATO act in military areas.Herring Council President, since I am familiar with the history of the Balkans, I would like to remind them that the peoples of Yugoslavia have lived together peacefully for decades.Destabilization began about ten years ago with the dissolution of Yugoslavia, in which the European Union played a crucial role.The crime of Yugoslavia was the only Balkanland that neither of NATO nor the European Union want to belong.What still stood after the air strikes is now destroyed by the supposedly disarmed, under the eyes of the KFOR, which is becoming increasingly clear as a crew.Every day, new crimes against people who are not Kosovoalbans come to light against the cultural heritage of Kosovo and hundreds of violations of UN Resolution 1244.In my opinion, it would be best to finish the advice of this part of Yugoslavia and looked for a solution that is acceptable for all sides, which respects the ethnic peculiarities of the region, but above all the principle of non -interference in the internal affairs of an independent country.I respect the opinion and knowledge of the MP about the Balkans region, although, to be honest, it is difficult for me to understand the extent to which the special features of the region in terms of political stability can be a solution to the problem.If we look at the democratic stability of the region, one could say that the cause of the current situation in the decay of Yugoslavia can be found.But we do not want to deal with international development here.	de
This is how a small European reform can hide another median and a median can hide a large one.Without counting that the big one can, in turn, hide another giant, because we will soon attend the proposal of a European criminal law and, why not, then a European justice minister, controlled by an extension of the powers of the European Parliament.I believe, therefore, that we must reflect carefully on the balance of powers that runs the risk of being disrupted with the presentation of this type of reforms, apparently punctual.It seems to us, finally, that proposals such as that of the European prosecutor express the inability to imagine Europe in another way that is not pyramidal and centralized, organized around a super-state.The union group for the Europe of the Nations wants, on the contrary, a Europe in which there are multiple centers around which nations are associated.And the network could be translated, for example, in a better coordination between national judicial authorities, with the possible creation of national formations specialized in infractions against community finances.The legal framework, Mr. President, already exists.Its principle is good.You just have to improve it.Mr. President, Mrs. Theato proposes an institutional revolution for a double reason.Public opinion, which remained indifferent to twenty million unemployed and the thousands of crazy cows, apparently worries the fraud that could endanger financial interests, and these two reasons would justify a double device: a European penal code that collects the anti -communal crimes and a European attorney general.Mrs. Theato has probably forgotten a European prison, given that the FBI, the European Police, already exists following the creation of the Olaf.All this would be instituted through two regulations, one for the prosecutor and one for the Criminal Code, regulations that would be based on article 280 of the Treaty, that is, from the derived law, since the same thing of the derived law is to allow all types of drifts.Indeed, there is a double drift.First, the classical, Eurofederalist ideological drift, a unique market, a unique VAT, a unique diplomacy, a unique army and now a unique criminal law and a unique prosecutor.All this to fight against a fraud that does not reach one billion euros, while the loss of tens of billions of euros is allowed because of the SPG, the free trade areas, the customs gifts to Chiquita and the billions lost in the fourth resource, the GDP, resulting from the budgetary ration pact.Next comes Puritan Drift: Northern German Europe, Lutheran, Calvinist and Quaker Europe wants to impose its moral order.In the background, the more the customs relax, the more we cling to the wallet.Mr. President, Ladies, at the moment it is more essential than ever an effective criminal protection of the financial interests of the European Union.	es
Mr President, we will vote for the application for a resolution of the GUE/NGL fraction because he denounces the responsibility of Total-Fina for this ecological disaster, and I advocate the proposal to prohibit female flags and the use of outdated ships or to pretend a double-walled outer skin for oil tankers.Let me add that it would be the least that is totally fully to make up for the reimbursement of the immediate and indirect damage as a result of the oil spill.How do you want to prevent similar disasters in the future if you do not impose draconian measures against the large oil companies, as well as against others who take the risk of making our planet uninhabitable?How should you not outrage if a bank refuses to reveal the name of the owners of the Erika, citing banking secrecy, without the governments being reacted?Basically, the problem lies in the fact that all governments, as well as all European institutions, grant large corporations such as Total Fina and their kind, the right to maximize their profits at the expense of their employees as well as at the expense of the environment.They admit business secret to the companies and the banks, even if this really covers criminal acts.Under these circumstances, even the best resolutions remain only fundamental petitions that are unable to prevent the large corporations from causing damage.President, dear colleagues!I am in favor of tightening the regulations on port state control and the regulations on classification companies.But we also have to stay with the facts.Erika ship has been examined four times in the past two years.It cannot be due to the number of examinations;Rather, it depends on ensuring the intensity of the controls.I have heard in the discussions of the past few weeks: The Member States do not have enough money to carry out the controls!I can't accept that.If the Member States decide together with us, 25 % of the ships are checked on the basis of the port state control, then you must also provide the staff!Then the checks must also be carried out in such a way that the inspector not only goes on board and looks at whether a fire extinguisher is missing somewhere, but then material tests must be carried out, because this ship has obviously broken apart due to material obveting.This can only be determined if the controls are carried out with a large intensity.It should be our goal to ensure that the port states controls are not superficial, but involve the material.Second, I also share the commissioner's hints and would like to encourage her to continue on this way.If it turns out that one or more classification societies have given compliance report, then they should be deleted by the list of permissible classification companies!This is the only deterrent to prevent other classification societies from also submitting a complacence report.Dear colleague Roth-Behrendt, we have the TÜV for ships.The classification companies are the TÜV for the ships!There are also good companies.You know some good companies, our French colleagues know some good companies, but we have to take a close look at which companies do not meet the requirements, and these must be deleted from the list.	de
The freedom of discretion of the state that you address in point e) of your amendment 10 does not seem to me to be consistent with the entire text of your otherwise awarded report.I therefore ask the colleagues to examine my amendment and hope that we can come to a result tomorrow.To the outside world, these two proposals seem to introduce certain procedures to promote freedom of movement in Europe and to implement the recent judgments that Ms. Berger spoke in their introductory comments.In the event of the United Kingdom, however, we believe that they also go beyond and are therefore unacceptable.This applies partly to the content, but sometimes also to the legal basis in relation to the special position of the United Kingdom.According to the agreements included in the contract, the United Kingdom retains its border controls.The system proposed in these legal texts stipulates that citizens from third countries who want to come to the United Kingdom in accordance with the procedures described present the service ID issued by another Member State and thereby bypass the border controls of the United Kingdom.If there are changes to the current border control regulations of the United Kingdom, then these changes should be brought about by the government and the parliament of the United Kingdom and not a passerby about the European legal law.For this reason, we will vote against these two proposals.President, Lord, ladies and gentlemen!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur and the colleague Wieland for the trouble to summarize the various amendments and the various interests in this report.These two proposals significantly contribute to the implementation of one of the four core principles of the internal market for freedom of service.The new regulation for cross-border services will undoubtedly improve both the functioning of the internal market as well as the company's ability to compete and act.The strict framework for the creation of the - and here I am with colleague Wieland - EU service ID card are unavoidable because they serve to prevent abuse such as illegal immigration and apparent contracts.Why do I think the guideline is so necessary?Three reasons: because of the economic importance of the third -country workers in the EU, because of the competitiveness of the companies and because of the smooth functioning of the internal market.On the one hand, I therefore welcome the strict frame and on the other hand, that the appropriate controls carried out by the Member States are as effective and simple as possible.My question at the end, because I am repeatedly asked about it, goes to the Commission: Will the directive be prejudiced to the accession negotiations?How is Article 1 interpreted and interpreted from your point of view because this plays an important role for our country at the border on the border and in the accession negotiations?President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues!So far, business people had to find that two important freedoms, namely freedom of movement and free service transactions, did not apply to them.They actually had to endure endless bureaucratic immigration procedures by Member States in which a service was to be provided.Around 13 million third -country nationals live in Europe.The number of business people among them is not well known, but it should certainly not be low.	de
"I take as proof an excellent report that our colleague Mario Soares established in international bodies on the state of the seas and the oceans.Rightly, when we talked about climate change, we refer to the greenhouse effect and the state of the atmosphere.But we also know that the deterioration of the oceans will considerably destabilize the entire parts of our land.It is therefore advisable that Europe, both because it must promote a certain model of development, and because it is itself confronted with serious problems of pollution and deterioration of its waters, whether it is its groundwater, its surface waters or its seas, must be, in a way, exemplary in its practice.Besides, our Europe has signed international conventions.I am thinking in particular of the OSPAR Convention where it has made commitments.She said: ""In a few years we will have to have stopped spills with pollution, we will have to have ceased to increase pollution and even we will have to get closer to an almost zero level, with regard to toxic substances or dangerous substances"".Europe therefore affixes its signature to international agreements, and then the directive arrives, as well as concrete policies on the ground, and there it announces that it will not be able to achieve the objectives set or it differs them on dates such as the very credibility of the signing of these international conventions is laid.This is why, engaging in the debate relating to the framework directive on water, from the first reading, the European Parliament had set out to request a coherence between the framework directive and the international objectives, and in particular, concerning the respect of OSPAR, a convergence which is effective, concrete and which engages us in action.The European Union water policy does not start from anything.Many guidelines have been adopted, and it is also the will of the Commission to make them more readable, more compatible with each other, with clearer objectives.It is therefore a concern for rationality that led to the realization of this framework directive.But our Parliament, at first reading, insisted that the current directive, not only was compatible with the commitments we made, - OSPAR type - but allows us to reverse the course of things.Because despite these numerous directives, despite frequent statements on the effort that must be made in terms of water protection, when we look at the state of the environment in Europe, we note that the objectives have not been achieved.In many cases the situation has deteriorated and therefore, we cannot be satisfied with an effort to rationalize the texts.We must set objectives that meet the challenges that are before us and we do not have much time, because if we do, as the commission had proposed, with too long deadlines, while it and the advice have further lengthened the deadlines, we will not only have a problem of credibility with opinion, but we know it well, the efforts will be put back tomorrow, and tomorrow they will not know thattarget objectives.I insist on this point, because it would not be necessary to wait for the umpteenth time, that disasters are reported every day in our newspapers to say: ""Ah! Europe did not do, ah! Europe should have"", and then, in the precipitation, to do as if we were going to solve the problems that we did not want to take the body in use in use."	fr
"We are, in principle, opposed to this type of programs as well as to structural funds, but since the vote concerns only the way in which these resources will be used - and not their volume - we voted for the report.We believe, in fact, that it is important to guarantee equal opportunities for the groups mentioned in the report.We have not voted against this report insofar as he announces some fair general principles: for example, the need to combat racism in the workplace and reduce gender inequalities on the labor market.But we did not vote for either because all of this remains most vague, if not in terms of vux piles.On the other hand, in terms of assistance and training projects for refugees, the report marks a decline compared to the initial text, since it wishes to specify that refugees are no longer concerned as such, but ""only refugees in the sense of the Geneva Convention"".This restriction is unacceptable while, throughout Europe, many refugees are in a dramatic situation, without protection, forced to work in illegality and to hide, while the governments and police of states that are said to be democratic hunt them.The first measure which is essential in this field is to give these undocumented legal means to lead a decent existence and to be able to work without being relegated to a status of parias, victims of unscrupulous employers and multiple administrative and police bully, the main one of which is to have to live permanently in the fear of expulsion..(En) I voted in favor of Ms. Stenzel's report on the Equal initiative because I think it is essential to continue the work that was started with the previous components Now, Horizon, Youthstart and Integra of Adapt and Employment Initiatives.We have to base ourselves on the lessons we have drawn from these actions.Equal means ""equality"".He must produce results.I am delighted with the concentration proposed on the promotion of new means of combating discrimination and any other form of inequality within the job market.I also support the desire to leave a outdated format and bring together partners in the search for innovative means to stem unemployment.Flexibility is needed.I strongly regret that only limited funds are available for this initiative.During the last programming period, 9 % of the structural funds were allocated to community initiatives.This figure is now 5.3 %.This means that funds must be used in order to obtain a maximum effect and information on partnerships must be widely and quickly disseminated.The Committee on Employment and Social Affairs has adopted several of the amendments that I had presented concerning, for example, the emphasis on access to priming capital, the way of exploiting new commercial opportunities in cities and rural areas, and criticism that companies were insufficient during previous initiatives.This has often had the consequence that good projects have not led to real opportunities in terms of employment.The positive experience of innovative actions on the part of small promoters was weakened by the distance between them from the decision -making process."	fr
"Only they can invent policies capable of modifying structures that have been created by men and men.Because it is the structural discriminations that women have to face the most, either in politics or in the labor market.It is then the European political parties to open up to women.On the other hand, article 191 of the Treaty (Ex 138 a) indicates that they - textually - ""constitute an important factor for integration into the union.""The article continues to say that ""these parties contribute to the formation of European conscience and to express the political will of the citizens of the Union.""While this provision has no legal value, it does not cease to be highly symbolic.It gives political parties an important role in the construction of a democratic Europe.It can be done, for example, introducing positive discrimination measures and promoting parity within our political parties.Some of them presented, on the occasion of the 1999 European elections, joint lists.It is a good practice, which must be generalized.I do not know if there will be a cause-effect relationship, but the case is that the proportion of deputies to the European Parliament went from 25.7% in 1994 to 29.9% in 1999. On the other hand, a woman has the presidency from the 1999 elections. I will end up repeating the conclusions extracted from the April 1999 conference organized by the commission, entitled ""Women and men in power.""Equality between men and women is not a problem that only interests women, it is a challenge that affects our entire society!It has recently been made with the increase in the number of women present in the decision -making bodies of the Union.In our own institution, currently 30% of elected representatives are women, including the president of the European Parliament.Finland has just chosen a woman like president.On average, a quarter of the governments of the Member States and just over a fifth of their parliaments are composed of women.This situation is still far from being fully satisfactory, especially since the figures vary greatly between the Member States, where the Nordic countries have a much greater feminine representation in positions of responsibility and decision making.This situation has more to do with the attitude and respect for the quality and ability of women's contribution to society than with fixed quotas.My group is not in favor of quotas in general because, in the long term, they can be counterproductive and even mining the cause for which they were created.However, we recognize that the experience in all member states is not the same, and a certain resource to this type of measures can even be justified as a temporary remedy to rebalance female representation where they are enormously infrared.We support the resolution on women in decision -making, adopted with a view to commemorating on March 8, International Women's Day, which has incorporated ten amendments of the liberal group and softly the reference to the quotas in tune with the approach outlined above."	es
"There have been large public investments at the federal level, at the state level and locally.They were enormous, and they were investments in modern infrastructures.Attention, here our direct commitment - I repeat, directed - on a public level and at the various levels is to build the electronic highways, that is, the routes on which these new vehicles run.The market, private individuals, companies will build vehicles to run, but it is we who have the obligation to make the new highways.So, what Minister Guterres said about the computer in each school, regarding the network that must take all peripheral areas, this is not an obligation that can only be left to the market because, simply, this does not do this, and on the other hand without this we do not achieve those new objectives of productivity development that are necessary.Our problem is therefore to avoid the crisis of peripheral economies, which does not mean centralization, does not mean centralized programming, but means giving peripheral economies the same chances that we give to centralized economies.This is then why the program must be directed to schools, that's why we have to take an entire age class and insist on it, make sure that in that age class there is no longer anyone who remains out of the new literacy.Lisbon therefore has a precise strategy.In Lisbon the real problem, in my opinion, is to inject a new courage for employment, for growth, knowing that we can do it, and therefore we must go towards this model that is based on certain balances.To summarize today's debate, I would like to take an expression that was used by one of you parliamentarians, if I remember correctly the honorable Goebbels, who said: ""We have a deficit of future in Europe"".It is simply this.We cried on us a long time, while the seeds of what we had put with so much sacrifice to the roots of Europe with so much they matured.Now, please also try to close the future deficit and make sense of the new generations, thinking that we are working together with modesty but seriously for something that lasts.It is clear then that it becomes indispensable to put the three processes together.Unfortunately, our terminology is horrendous, but the problems of macroeconomics, work and structural problems we really put together, now, and then we have the ability and the possibility of obtaining the results we wanted, with very simple, even specific actions.We remember European society: we have not yet found unanimity for European society, but there are hundreds of thousands of companies that ask us.At any cost this must be done, because simply the idea of ​​operating in fifteen countries - which are now becoming only one - with different rules in the elementary principles of the company is an unsustainable idea: we cannot sell it, because it makes no sense.The same goes for the European patent: this too cannot sell it;and the rules on contracts, the capital market;Even the seeds of the coordination of social security, because it is useless for us to think of great opportunities for mobility, that we make programs of such success such as Erasmus, Socrates to make people more mobile, if we then have social security rules that do not help us in this mobility."	it
It is right that the Lisbon summit, which will take place at the end of this month, focuses on the analysis of the situation.Despite their complexity, these processes all have a common denominator: improve the quality of life of citizens of the European Union.In order to achieve this, we do not need new formulas, new working groups or new discussion offices.We know what the tools at our disposal are.Often the opinions of citizens and, sometimes, ideological opposition cause these tools to be used.Now it is extremely important to quickly break down all those obstacles that prevent the creation of a real European internal market;Only in this way will it be possible to avoid having to continue moving in fifteen different national markets, as still happens in many sectors.When, in the 80s, the idea of ​​the internal market began to be carried out, it was possible to maintain a similar pace, to use a metaphor, to that of a steam accelerated train.Today - with the rapid development of the electronic commerce and the speed of transmission and processing of data, the situation is completely different - it would take place at least the speed of Mika Häkkinen's fireball.Nonetheless, we must be sure that, on a decision -making level, the strength does not fail and that the engine does not start losing blows before reaching the finish line.How can we think of creating the most competitive economic area in the world if we don't have the courage to liberalize competition inside it?The already approved liberalization of the telecommunications and energy sector will help to create new jobs and reduce prices for both industry and consumers.In the same way, the demolition of obstacles for small and medium -sized enterprises - regardless of whether they are complex methods imposed by the authorities, access to risk capital or tax issues - is fundamental for the purpose of greater competitiveness and greater well -being.As part of the improvement of global competitiveness, adequate tax harmonization and modernization of our social security systems are also included in order to at least those members of the European Union which have a particularly high tax burden, can reduce the rates that brake the employment process.The foundations are however built through training and research.It is right to try to quickly create infrastructures of knowledge to be made available to businesses, schools and private individuals at reasonable prices or free of charge.In particular, it is important to engage in creating and maintaining sufficient resources to encourage the development of promising employment sectors.Among them, the technological sector, electronic commerce, tourism and, for example, assistance to the elderly, given the undeniable continuous aging of the population are naturally included.Parliament, Commission and Council must remember two important things: regardless of whether it is training and research, development of competitiveness or reduction of obstacles for entrepreneurship, these are tasks in any case of competence of the member countries.	it
With the determination of a sector reserved for the public postal operators based on weight and price limits, the mail directive enabled a gradual and controlled liberalization.The sudden reduction in these limit values ​​questions the balance between the common good obligation and the economic viability of the postal services.In view of a globalization process, in which profit and profit thinking is more and more opposed to the effort for regional balance and the goal of social cohesion, it is reaffirmed at this point that we are taking on the service in the European Union subject to the common good, whether it is now about the railway or the day after tomorrow.President!Like other Scottish members of this high house, i.e. representatives of Scotland, I also raise my voice to protest against everything that leads to a decline of quality rural life in remote areas.The postal service and the post office are a characteristic of life in rural communities all over Europe and not least in Scotland.It would be a disaster if they were taken intentionally or even unintentionally measures that would be destroyed.I don't think anyone wants that.I don't think the Commission wants to explain the war to the Scottish or Greek islands.But I think she could accidentally do great damage.It is about determining the speed and which methods the gradual liberalization of postal services should take.If the goals are set too low for the continued existence of the postal service monopoly, it would be uneconomical to maintain the universality of the service in remote areas at an affordable price.The balance between universality and affordability is crucial.The very clear message, which is now going to the Commission from all sides of the house, is that the commission should act carefully.For example, the commission should not suddenly do a jump of 350 grams, as some MPs suggested, only do 50 grams.On the contrary, it should be careful.I can imagine that everything under 150 grams would be extremely unclear under these circumstances.The solidarity and cohesion of people across Europe depends on the idea that you can send a letter anywhere and that this letter is delivered everywhere to an affordable stamp fee.Stay with universality and affordability!President!In order to guarantee a high -quality postal universal service, it must definitely be preserved as a public service.The universal service, which includes an offer of high -quality postal services at affordable prices that are provided at every place in the area, forms the basis of the way of working in the entire postal system and must lead to a unit tariff throughout the national territory.But he must be preserved as a public service.This is the only way to guarantee that the network is all -encompassing from collecting to delivery, which is not fragmented or only partially and as used as the postal service operator fits.However, as is well known, the Commission has commissioned studies to be informed of the Community of the Community of the Community of the Community of the Community, of which it did not inform the European Parliament, and that's why there is no know about the consequences of their application, be it in the service for the citizens, be it for today's European postal operators, whether under economic aspects or in terms of employment.	de
"That is why the importance of the proposals we present for that purpose is due.In the communication of the Commission, a series of objectives and proposals that take into account the need to continue the efforts deployed in control and surveillance are listed, to adopt new technical measures in the chapter of the selective capacity of fishing methods, the monitoring of the application of the legislation in force, etc.But in its communication, the Commission mentions while it has no capacity to impose respect for this legislation.However, the existing measures and the appropriate means are not lacking: the Commission has an entire arsenal of mandatory provisions, measures and decisions (of international and community origin) already in force in the sectors of fishing and the protection of the marine environment.Effectiveness and hyperglamentation are not couples.The sea professionals must be remembered, they are willing to apply community legislation on condition that it is equitable in all Member States, which is technically acceptable and applicable, and has a real scientific basis.It seems inadmissible that, in the Fisheries Commission, one of the officials of the European Commission has dared to publicly affirm that the financial means provided by the commission to some scientific agencies allow to control their conclusions.This is a very serious deviation: the commission, obviously, should not arrive any kind of right to guide the conclusions of scientists in order to apply the policy that it deems appropriate taking into account only their interests.Regarding reducing the pressure exerted by fishing activity on resources, it is important to emphasize the international nature of this obligation.What would be to reduce our European fishing fleet if parallel to third countries maintained their pressure on fishery resources?On the other hand, it should be noted that the progressive globalization of commercial exchanges has considerably reduce the effectiveness of controls and monitoring of fishing activities.Transhipment have become very common practices and it is not uncommon for fishing products from a Member State that cannot be sold in the Union due to the exception of CTAs are marketed as imported products or as coming from another Member State.This last case is very frequent in companies whose capital comes from a member state other than the fishing boat pavilion (it is in fact in a covert form of ""quota-hoping"").Food security related to sea products also plays a capital function.It is necessary to preserve the positive image of these products and prevent non -salubres food products from being marketed in the European Union.Therefore, the deputies of the European Group will vote against this report in which it is not required what are the deficiencies of the commission's communication and that increases the obligations of Natura 2000 on the fishing sector.The vote has concluded.Interruption of the session period The session period is interrupted.Resumption of the session period"	es
The priority objective of this reflection is to see the instruments that the international community can arrange to stabilize the international monetary and financial system.From this point of view, Mr. Bolkestein, the resolution proposal does not isolate the question of the Tobin Tax.If you read it carefully, this capital flow tax proposal is an instrument among others to try to force international investors to maintain responsible behaviors in financial markets.Secondly, it is not said in the resolution that we want an initiative on a only European basis.This is the reason why we explicitly refer to the autumn sessions of the International Monetary Fund for the European Union, that is, the Commission, but also the Council, take a position on how to defend the opportunity to stabilize the international financial and monetary system and introduce international taxation.I don't want there to be confusion in this debate.We do not want we, an environmentalists, a resolution that is only a alibi.It is not about adding a study to the tens that have already been done - that of the commission would undoubtedly be interesting - but to achieve the commission and the Council, that is, of each of the governments that make up the Union, a clear, positive or negative political attitude, to know if they are willing to defend in the competent public forums, the International Monetary Fund in the first place, the opportunity of such a tax of the other instruments necessary for the stability of the international monetary system.As for the argument according to which this initiative will increase uncertainty, which I know, very short -term capital movements have precisely as a function to play with uncertainty and bet on evolutions between currencies or between different short -term financial assets.This argument does not seem to me therefore relevant.I will not enter the background debate.I think everyone has their arguments.I attract your attention, however, not only on paragraph 9 of the resolution but on paragraph 10. It is clearly a political position what we expect, within a very clear period, the preparation of the autumn session of the International Monetary Fund, and we ask, if this resolution is voted tomorrow in the Plenary, that the commission and the council are presented before the Parliament to tell us what positions would defend on this occasion.Mrs. President, lordships, my group congratulates itself that takes place today a debate like this, even more so that we have not saved efforts with colleagues from different groups to achieve it.Naturally, we do not all have the same approach and I believe that our debate and the resolution proposals that we have presented at the beginning demonstrate it.That said, we are not, in what concerns us, indifferent to the step forward that constitutes the commitment resolution, which invites the commission to submit a report in six months.We think that the European Parliament can thus play its role by taking the initiative, even if it is timidly, on this issue, although of course -and I agree with the preceding speaker -if paragraph 9 will be questioned, this resolution would evidently lose its essence.Our debate touches, indeed, a vital issue that more and more citizens are pose legitimately: what place to attribute respectively to man and the financial sphere in today's economy?	es
In general we can say that the first is left and manifests social worries, in addition to examining economic problems, while this document, that colleague Katifortis did not consider it appropriate to support - and I think it has done well -, is a hybrid relationship in which, starting from a structure with social concerns, the main conclusions have been taken.What did Mr Katifortis propose and that was removed from the relationship?He offered us an ambitious relationship, in an optimistic Europe, which intended to quantify the objectives for the results they wanted to achieve.In fact, Europe has advanced thanks to programs with quantified objectives.For example, why did the proposal based on which the population active in Europe has to reach 75 percent of the population, while currently 60 percent is to reach in Europe?A rate of 60 percent is very low compared to that of Japan or the United States and with such a modest employment rate we certainly cannot produce as much as the aforementioned countries.We must therefore increase the employment rate with competitive jobs.As supported in view of the Lisbon summit, we must prepare manpower in possession of a scientific training to manage new technologies;In addition, investments must grow at a more tight rhythm.We know very well the idea advocated by colleague Von Wogau, according to which what is needed is the flexibility of the workforce.I wanted to contrast with this argument the Portuguese example, where the laws on work are not flexible and where the unemployment rate is less than 5 percent - and in recent years it has continued to decrease - because investments increase (obviously with community help) at a much higher pace than the average of the European Union.Therefore we want a Europe with economic growth, but attentive to social problems.Mr. President, like many other deputies, I would like to thank the honorable Katforis for the interesting relationship.Reading the text and focusing on the panorama of the European economy that emerges, I derive a very worrying impression of this.The investment rate is too low, unemployment remains at excessively high levels and growth remains insufficient.This is why, probably, it must not be surprised that the euro continues to lose ground compared to other currencies, despite the fact that the ECB is to do in great secret to the purchase of euros to support the course.The signer ascertained that stability does not represent an objective aim;I agree.There is too much talk of stability, convergence and coordination, and too little of the factors capable of inducing innovation and development.In my eyes, cooperation within the UEM is like a clumsy giant that struggles to keep up with such a mobile economy.However, the conclusions I draw are completely different from those of the speaker who preceded me.I believe that it is necessary to focus on human resources, in part through a macropolysis that generates demand and new job opportunities, in part - but perhaps above all - through field measures, in terms of training, democratization of businesses and improvement of social conditions.	it
"If we continue to bother in the proposals that have so far given mediocre results, I do not see how we will advance, or what the Commission can do.The same remark applies to the enlargement which represents its own end without a much more effective reform of the European Union and its structures, and proposals that the Commission could also have made during the CIG.Mr. President, I would like to end with a positive note, perhaps contrary to the advice of certain colleagues, with regard to the telegram you have sent to the Austrian government.Your position has convinced us, you were right not to isolate this country even more.However, we will see in practice what will be the concrete gestures.I repeat, Mr. President, it is a vision in our opinion a little myopic.He especially lacks an impulse in the sectors I have cited, for example the Balkans.Can we continue to exclude the Balkans from enlargement, without thinking that Croatia, Macedonia and other countries also have the right to be part of our Europe?Madam President, Mr. Prodi, I applaud your proposal to make a radical decentralization of Union activities, but I ask you: Why do you then present a collection of centralizing laws?I remember the speech held five years ago by your predecessor.Mr. Santer had made the same promises as you - ""less and better"" but what we had in the end was ""much more and much worse"".I don't think you are able to keep your commitments.You talk about decentralization, but you act in centralizing.This collection of laws is only a monotonous list of questions about which citizens will lose all influence;It is yourself, Mr. Prodi, who remove this influence from citizens, even for social issues.You talk about increasing transparency, but you present proposals to hide documents that are today accessible.Your committee is made up of 20 people who are the only ones, within the EU, to be able to propose a reduction in the legislative volume.No local politician has this power from the moment a law was adopted in Brussels.This is why the collection of laws published by the Commission should at least be accompanied by an equally large collection of skills which are returned to the Member States and to the democratic power of citizens, failing which the volume of the legislation adopted in Brussels will not cease to grow.We have adopted 10,000 laws and as many legislative changes;The candidate countries have received 26,000 documents, which represent, for the Polish parliament, for example, 140,000 pages to examine.Already today, this figure is a lot, much too high.Brussels must make fewer decisions and grant more powers in this area to citizens, regions and member states;Only decisions concerning cross -border problems about which national parliaments can no longer legislate effectively must be the responsibility of Brussels."	fr
Secondly, it would be necessary for the Human Rights doctrine to cease to be instrumentalized as it is today, an ideological warfacching in the hands of a caste that throws the right to unilaterally decree who represents human rights and who is located outside its sphere, which allows us to deny all legitimacy and, if necessary, all freedom to those that the unique thought has designated as politically incorrect.There is no freedom for the enemies of freedom, they said, two centuries ago, the promoters of revolutionary terror, of that revolution that was unfortunately, the matrix of all modern totalitarianism.There are no human rights for human rights enemies, they say today the Turifters of the new world order, who reign almost exclusively in financial centrals, in international institutions, in the media and cultural networks, in educational institutions, and I am short.What remains, for example, of the human right of Austrian to freely choose his destiny, if that election is dictated by those who decide instead what is convenient or not, and if their leaders, who come from a legal and legitimate process, are insultingly received, as recently they were received in their country, Mr. President in the exercise of the Council, Mistr of Portugal?I don't know if it's here to listen to me.What will remain of the human rights of those who sympathize with the flamenco block, one of the most important in the flamenco region, if the Belgian Parliament adopts tomorrow the incredible, the indecent, the ignominious proposal of law that emanates from its main political competitor, the popular union, which pretends smoothly and plainly the dissolution of its rival?What remains of the right to the critical study of our history, when the authors and editors are persecuted, as it was still yesterday, before the Court of Appeal of my city of Lyon, the young historian Jean Plantin, object of absurd, arrogant and injurious requirements by the prosecutor of the Supreme Court Jean-Lolivier Viout, satisfied expression of the unique thought and intellectual conformism?What strange conception of human rights which consists in fraudulently assimilating patriotism peaceful to warm nationalism, the legitimate protest against immigration policy to me I do not know what xenophobia and the necessary defense of identities to racism!What are the human rights of the millions of French voters of the National Front, deprived of any political representation, vilified daily, as it still happened on Monday, on state television that must pay with their taxes, when the simple expression legitimately exasperated of one of our colleagues, Mr. Le Pen, serves as a pretext to ínic condemnations, violating the right, violating justice, equity and morality and moralclearer texts, deprive that representative of our millions of fellow citizens of the mandate that owes their votes and not to the favors of power.In summary, lordships, I will believe in your speech on human rights in Europe when you recognize your political adversaries the same rights as those granted.	es
"I do not expect waving or giving away all of this with which they will be confronted in the next few years.I rather count that the European Parliament is not only a critical observer, as it was in this case, but also actively participates in the fact that the Union in the fight against crime.Voting Mr. Goebbels, I apologize, I have the impression that there is a bit of a change, since there was an oral change to change, in which it was suggested that the words ""with a high credit check on the basis of a recognized creditworthiness scale"" and they had wished for such a change.Mrs. President!I apologize, I first had a change of change 36 in the eye, which logically comes before the application for change 37.We are now talking about amendment 37, and here we have a similar problem.A high credit check is not required for the facilities, but for the instruments.So the text reads: ""Instruments with a high rating base on a recogified scale are subject to reliable and verifiable valuation"".I ask you to excuse this error again.Are there any objections to this oral amendment?(The parliament agrees to the oral application application.) (In successive votes, the parliament accepts the two designs of the legislative resolution.) Mrs. President!I asked for the word right before the start of the session to say something solely for you as President of this plenary, a plenary of everyone present here.For the second time in two weeks, visits to this parliament, which served to charges conditions - what I respect and with which I completely agree, since I am for the freedom of expression of all - attacks against people, parties, such as those I represent and institutions.I keep such a procedure, especially if you are present, Ms. President, to be dishonest, and I decide to decide it, all the more than we are about to make an election campaign.Therefore, especially because of the respect you deserve, I cannot accept such procedures and emphatically reject them.That was a personal remark, as I am told.We will note this in the protocol.Mrs. President!Above all out of respect for you, a respect that I think is worthy of, and out of respect for this plenary, I did not explicitly go into the specific topic that I spoke about, but now I do it as a member of this parliament, as a general secretary of a party of the Basque Country and as a normal citizen of this country, due to the particularly difficult allegations against people and parties like that, with a long democratic tradition and withConscientious respect and defense of human rights for many years.Mrs. President!I would like to express my concern that this louder defense of human rights, which was just presented by Mr. Gorka Knörr, apparently does not prevent his government from counting on the parliamentary cooperation of a faction that not only does not condemn violence against citizens and real assets, but also supports them and encourages them to do so.As I see, Mr. Gorostiaga Atxalandabaso on the same topic is asking for the word.We will not open any pronunciation now."	de
"In its presentation for the summit, the Commission has set quantitative objectives for development in employment, unemployment and female employment.The Commission has also set a goal for the reduction of poverty problems within Europe in the next ten years.It seems good to emphasize common objectives, since the policies of the countries in this field will be different -they must be.In some community countries - not mentioning any, I do not forget any - fight against great youth strike, in other countries such as my own country, Denmark, unemployment among young people is very low, yes, there is even a struggle between entrepreneurs and educational institutions to attract young people to themselves.There are differences between countries, as regards problems, systems, cultures and traditions and therefore there must be differences in the choice of the media with which to achieve the common objectives of greater employment and less social isolation.The design of the employment policy guarantees this through the exchange of experiences and ideas of the Luxembourg process and although there are enough common features in the problems that we will face in the coming years, both with respect to the employment policy and social policy, I must say that there are some common challenges and others that each one has to solve separatesocial problems, but collaborate and serve as mutual inspiration.I want to highlight both the importance that we pursue common objectives and that each country maintains its sovereignty and responsibilities when setting its social and employment policies and that we maintain a certain competence between the systems that ensure dynamism and development in the design of social and employment policies.Mr. President, as a representative of Flanders and in the name - of what I would call - the nationalist regions, represented in the European Free Alliance, his defense in favor of a strong European approach in which each of the fifteen Member States does not attempt does not attempt does not attempt does not try to gain power, but in which cooperation charges more strength.You pointed out the existence of fifteen different public opinions, but in practice there are many more since in the same Member States there are large internal differences.Is it necessary that I, that I am from Belgium, indicate the difference in existing opinions between Flanders and Valonia?Is it necessary to tell you that there is a difference between ancient Eastern Germany and Western Germany?In addition, there is a danger of a duality in our public opinion due to globalization.Instead of the differences of before between the ""Havenots and The Haves"", today we have differences between those who can follow the rhythm of this society and those who cannot follow it or directly abandon it."	es
I would therefore like to reiterate my congratulations to the Langen rapporteur for the work accomplished, to thank all the speakers and, of course, to greet the action of the Provan vice-president during the conciliation procedure, which has effectively contributed to obtaining a positive result.I also salute the reasonable and flexible action of the council.Save The agenda calls for the report (A5-0010/2000) of Ms. Ahern, on behalf of the delegation of the Parliament to the Conciliation Committee, on the Common Decision Project, approved by the Conciliation Committee, the European Parliament and the Council arresting a multi -year program for the encouragement of energy efficiency -Save (C5-0334/1999 -1997/0371 (COD)).Madam President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for this useful and in -depth conciliation procedure which has completely gone in a good climate, which is not always the case.I am delighted to say that I can consider the final result of this conciliation as satisfactory for the Parliament since the common project has integrated all its amendments, whether it is entirely or after reformulation.The sum finally allocated to the program also constitutes a considerable improvement in the council proposal at second reading, a proposal that we had estimated completely unacceptable and we have made great progress in this regard.I therefore propose that this assembly accepts to adopt the proposals relating to Save and the conclusions drawn during the third reading conciliation.I would like to remind the Assembly that Parliament adopted, at the second reading, this report which contains 8 amendments, including a restoration of the original budget of the Commission.The Commission accepted 5 of the proposed amendments, including the budgetary allowance, and I thank the Commission for its constant support for the budget during the conciliation procedure, since the council proposal was unacceptable.During the procedure, we reached an agreement on studies and actions to be carried out to design, implement, supplement and assess community measures.Compromise formulations have been agreed for 5 other amendments, including legislative and non -legislative measures, and the inclusion of local energy centers, and, very important, audit systems in terms of energy in examining the progress made in terms of energy efficiency.I hope you all agree that this is significant progress.Parliament firmly defended the question of the financial envelope in the face of the very thin opening offer made by the Council.Finally, we had to come together several times before the council increased the sum and made a substantial offer.We have obtained an increase of 2 million compared to the sum proposed at the start, which constituted a decisive increase that I recommend to you and which will be able to allow, the Commission confirmed, the implementation of the program.This was important to us.However, I want to say that this budget is and has always been modest and that, therefore, the financing of this program is more symbolic than real.It is mainly Member States that finance energy savings.We have to keep this in mind when we will approve this program.It would be regrettable that our community achievements be more symbolism than reality because enthusiasm exists, at the local level, in favor of actions, including community actions, intended to promote energy savings.	fr
I am satisfied with the rapporteur's approach to state aid and I congratulate it.There is too often tendency to castigate state aid as measures distorting competition.Certainly an effective competition policy is a prerequisite for the proper functioning of the internal market and the economic and monetary union.However, as the rapporteur points out, such aid is sometimes essential and can allow, beyond the survival of such or such a company, to contribute to sustainable development (article 6 of the treaty), services of general interest (article 16) and economic and social cohesion (article 158).However, it is obvious that they must be controlled, a mission that returns to the European Commission.Aid devoted each year by the Union's member states to the sectors considered reached a total of 95 billion euros during the period 1995-1997, 40 % of which are for the manufacturing sector.These aids decreased considerably compared to the previous period, 1993-1995 (drop by 13 % in the total amount and 3.8 % to 2.6 % of the amount of aid in the manufacturing sector).This decline in aid is mainly explained by the decrease in aid granted to the new German Länder.I deplore, like the rapporteur, that the figures presented in the report do not cover all state aid.The European Commission must compensate for these deficiencies as quickly as possible.It must also cooperate with the Member States to improve the quality of the data in good time, that is to say, for the ninth report.It would be good for the Commission to publish a register which makes the amount of state aid by Member State.I also regret that the European Parliament is completely excluded from the advisory committee on state aid.To compensate for this situation, the European Commission must make, to make us, regular reports.I will finish on one aspect of the use of state aid which seems particularly dangerous to me: these are aid that leads to the relocation of companies from one Member State to another, with the risk of a grant hunt that brings nothing to the common objectives of the EU.This is why I hope that the next report on state aid includes an assessment of the effect of these employment aids, as well as on the industry and craft sectors in beneficiary countries.Langen report (A5-0073/1999) In the important debate on competition, I expressed myself this morning on the text of Mr. Langen, relating to the application in 1998 of the 6th code of aid to the steel industry.As the Court of Justice recognized it in its order of May 3, 1996, the steel sector is particularly sensitive to competitive disturbances.This is why it was legitimate to establish an aid regime in this sector aimed at guaranteeing the survival of efficient companies, although article 4, point C, of ​​the CECA treaty for all state aid to the steel industry.This is, in fact, the object of the 6th code of aid to the steel industry.	fr
I do not want to introduce changes in the text of the common position.The manufacturer is responsible, must be responsible and the last user must be able to deliver the car without costs.In my opinion there are many unjustified fears.The automobile industry pressure group has created confusion on many occasions.I want to reiterate once again to your lordships who, as the experience dictates, the treatment costs must have an impact.They are not such high costs.In my country they are calculated in about 150 florines per car.This begins from day one and at the same time you can carry out the treatment of old cars.Likewise, a great industry can be created now that it is occupied that car cemeteries, which were previously normal in our Member States, no longer exist.Therefore, I do not want to introduce changes in that regard in the commitment achieved.I think it is positive that we approve as soon as possible the legislation that has been presented to us.This is good because the nine million cars that are manufactured every year in Europe can also be properly recycled and this will result in the benefit of all.Mr. President, the current proposal is important in the commitment to prevent the production of hazardous waste from vehicles at the end of its useful life and is important in order to promote recycling and recovery of materials from targeting vehicles.Hence, it seems fundamental from the environmental point of view that the prohibition of the use of toxic heavy metals is fully implemented and that we do not weaken the responsibility of the manufacturers.To make the latter, we eliminate the incentives for manufacturers to build and manufacture cars that produce less residues.The common position achieved with great work in the Council, to which the Commission was added and was also ratified by the Parliament Environment Commission, fully meets the demands in environmental matters and therefore the amendments presented by members of the Environment Commission that have the object of the demands in environmental matters and fundamentally moderate the responsibility of the manufacturers of car are very strange and incomprehensible.If these amendments are approved, I really believe that we will have thrown out the credibility of the Parliament in environmental issues.Until now, this Parliament has acted positively as a catalyst in the defense of the environment, and if the amendments presented by Messrs. Florenz and Lange are approved, in this case we will now be a negative environmental factor.To this we must add that if we soften the responsibility of the manufacturers in this case, this will seriously have an impact on the future in other areas such as, for example, the next directive on electronic scrap and computer science.Therefore, I would like to recommend to the members of this Parliament that despite their political affiliation vote against the amendments presented to the common position that will weaken the environmental standard and soften the responsibility of the manufacturers.	es
In our quality of deputies to Parliament, we must underline with special emphasis that the work initiated in favor of the consolidation of fundamental rights becomes even more importance.It is increasingly important than the respect and integrity of human dignity and the rights of minorities, including the rights of all persons residing in the territory of the European Union, become an essential part of the principles of the rule of law of the European Union and, therefore, it must be achieved that the Charter of Fundamental Rights is legally binding.This letter should not stay in mere statement.It is also important that Austrian democratic forces are supported, since there is no intention on our part of isolating Austria.We know that most Austrians respect these values.Austrians have also organized manifestations;Not all manifestations have taken place outside Austria.Surely, many citizens have also mobilized of those who actively refrain in elections by voting for non -existent candidates and who have been looking forward to a change in Austrian policy.In my opinion, Parliament must support these democratic forces.I also call on the president of Austria to examine all the possibilities of forming a government composed of democratic forces.Mrs. President, lordships, I just want to underline the value of a position like the one that the president of our group, Mr. Francis Wurtz, has just remembered.I value the statements of the presidency of the Council and the position of the 14 states that have rejected official contacts with the Austrian government in the event that the Jörg Haider party was included.Our comment is even more important because, as they know, we substantially disagree with the policies practiced by this Europe: of its economic and social policies, its democratic deficit, of the implication of these same states in the dramatic war of the Balkans.This disagreement highlights even more, if possible, today's appreciation: an exceptional element, because exceptional is the danger of a rebirth of an irrational and neo -Nazi component in Europe.This danger does not affect Austria, it affects Europe.We are talking about us, not Austria.We know the social causes that together with unemployment and uncertainty contribute to fostering trends towards that direction.We know the cultural causes -xenophobes, racist- but we cannot fail to recognize in the disability and non -will of these forces of extreme right to adjust accounts to Nazism, the possibility of creating an explosive mixture in Europe.He talks about the alpine arch, talks about all our states: conditions are being created by which a danger to European democracy and civilization can be reborn.The position of the presidency has been aware of this drama of civilization.Europe shows that Auschwitz has not forgotten, Europe finds a soul.Now, however, it should be consistent with its actions and the first to be consistent should be the commission that, on the contrary, has demonstrated in this issue a lack of transparency and a weakness that makes the value of the position of the presidency even more evident.	es
However, the point was withdrawn from the agenda of the budget commission last night without a debate or a vote took place.Therefore, it must be removed from today's agenda.It's logical, Mr. Wynn.The report is therefore removed from the agenda.Mr. President, I presume that the comments that Ms. Lynne made yesterday on health and security in this building concerned the pipes because he reigns on the fifth floor of the tower a pestilential odor.It is advisable to take care of this problem because it clearly indicates a serious failure.I do not constantly want to put the problems of this building on the carpet but that is a serious concern.Madame Ahern, we took note.I would ask you to submit this specific case, which concerns the fans of a precise floor, to the quaestors, who are in fact responsible for this type of problem.However, we will also share with our services.Thank you so much.(The minutes are adopted) Reform of European Competition Policy The agenda calls in common the following reports: A5-0069/1999 of Mr. Von Wogau, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the White Paper of the Commission on the modernization of rules for applying articles 85 and 86 of the CE Treaty (COM (1999) 101-C5-0105/1999-1999/2108 (COS));A5-0078/1999 by Mr. Rapkay, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the XXVIIIth Commission Report on Competition Policy (1998) (Sec (1999) 743 - C5-0121/1999 - 1999/2124 (COS) (COS);A5-0087/1999 by Mr. Jonckheer, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the seventh report on state aid in the manufactured products sector and certain other sectors of the European Union (COM (1999) 148 - C5-0107/1999 - 1999/2110 (COS));A5-0073/1999 by Mr. Langen, on behalf of the Economic and Monetary Commission, on the Commission report on the application in 1998 of its decision No 2496/96/CECA of December 18, 1996 establishing community rules for the steel aid (Code of Aids to the steel) (COM (1999) 094 - C5-0104/1999 - 1999/2107 (COSS)).Mr. President, the Commissioner, dear colleagues, today, we are carrying out an important debate on the competition policy of the European Union.We debate a very controversial modernization project of European law in terms of understanding, namely the Von Wogau report, a subject much more controversial than the vote within the Economic Commission seems to show.From the outset, I mean that, for my part, and in this concrete case, I believe that the commission's proposal is wrong and that we still have to determine whether the concept of modernization is really justified with regard to the content of the white paper on articles 81 and 82 or if, in this case, a step back would not rather be the appropriate concept.However, today we are discussing the report on state aid and the general report on competition policy for 1998, my contribution to this common discussion affecting the last report.	fr
"The legal obligation to reach a situation characterized by zero emissions levels and the termination of discharges within 20 years would in fact mean a ban on the use of all the substances identified.These provisions risk putting enormous problems regarding transfrontier basins and candidate countries and, consequently, to complicate the expansion.I would like to talk about a sector in particular that I follow very closely, that of agriculture, the main consumer of water: it must, as has already started to do, take their part according to the principle according to which those who pollute pays, but must also take into account particularity and constraints, in particular in the arid regions.As for the amendments relating to radioactive substances, I am in favor of the controls, but the question of the legal base arises that falls within the sphere of the Euratom Treaty.Andersson Report (A5-0033/2000) The EDD group was unable to vote in favor of the Andersson report.It certainly contains valid observations;Among other things, it is admitted, on page 15, in the motivation that ""the different level of development and the different traditions of the Member States in the social protection sector make uniform harmonization impossible"".The concept of ""uniform harmonization"" is one of those raffazzonate expressions, which obscure the integration process we are talking about.It is also true, as stated in the motivation, that a harmonization would be harmful, in that ""it would impose the weakest states of the weakest efforts and, like competition, would push the socially more developed states to proceed with cuts in social protection regimes. Such a harmonization would not benefit anyone"".Still, things are like this: a social model is created, which actually involves harmonization, and moreover a uniform harmonization.At point D. It is underlined that ""the union can bring a surplus value by defining truly binding and effective convergence criteria"", and further on in the report it should be noted that the development of this process of convergence is promoted by discussions between the Ecofin Council and the Council of Social Affairs and employment ministers, and finally in point 7 it is underlined that ""the process aimed at creating the social convergence must be accompanied by an effective convergenceambitious "".And here we approach the core of the issue: this social harmonization project does not concern social policy, but it is a continuation of the EUEM project of the European Union which has a very particular interest for the three countries that is outside, and that can be rescued by this Titanic, that is Great Britain, Sweden and Denmark, for this reason it is important for us to emphasize that we cannot support a proposal whose fundamental basis is to expand the UEM project.Mr. President, I voted in favor of the Commission's provision on the modernization of social protection because, in my opinion, it goes in the direction - while not coming completely - to finally offer European legislation in the social and pensioner fields."	it
Now, we consider - and I believe that this is the interpretation made by the commission - that the entire approximation process, at the level of the evaluation of the collection aimed at the global integration process of the island in the field of the European Union in a future adhesion, requires the participation, as soon as possible, of the communities of the north of the island and the possibility that also the European Union, in the effort that makes evaluation of the conditions of adhesion,allow the adhesion project itself to be substantiated.On the other hand, that means that, by the Council, we must encourage - and I consider that this Parliament could also do it - the participation of the commission in that effort.I think we cannot stop sending a message of trust to the commission regarding its role in that regard.Finally, I think we must continue actively collaborating - and that is also the intention of the presidency - with the United Nations, given the ability, intelligence and the ability with which the Secretary General and the United Nations structure itself have managed to direct that debate and, in particular, they have tried to contribute to the harmonization of the positions between the parties.As I said at the beginning, it is observed that the conclusions of the Helsinki European Summit last year had obvious repercussions on the evolution of the positions of the various parts in the process.The Nicosia government expressed its satisfaction with the conclusions of Helsinki, which provide the possibility of accession to the European Union without the previous solution of the island's division.Now, I cannot stop observing that these same authorities manifest are concerned about the pressures they may suffer to resolve the issues raised by that division and that, as it is evident, some concessions involve.That is related to the evolution that has been in terms of transferring populations and the possibility of reorganization in this regard in the case of a different solution for the island.On the other hand, the Turkish chipriots fear - it is worth hiding it - that Türkiye's candidacy to the European Union induces Ankara to more flexible their position in this regard.I consider that, regardless of whether they can be some of the misgivings warm by the two communities in that approach, those aspects, which can configure a negative interpretation of the situation by the authorities of both parties, may also be the background reason to shelter some hope regarding a final solution.For this final solution, one of the most important elements that characterize relations in that area and in this period will be clearly essential: the extraordinarily positive evolution of those between Athens and Ankara and the very important role that the Minister of Foreign Affairs, George Papandreu, and the Minister of Turkish Foreign Affairs, Ismail CEM have played in them.We consider that in that framework the conditions for a positive evolution have been created.For our part, by the Presidency of the Council, we will not stop following with all this evolution, we will not stop collaborating with the Secretary General and with his personal representative in that regard.	es
Mr. Swoboda's balanced and praise -worthy report joins this surprising and pleasing conclusion very concretely.The European Union knows what it has to do in Macedonia.Help this recent regional haven for thousands of war refugees to correctly play its role as stimulator of the desired stability pact for the Balkans.Mr. President, I have been concerning myself for eight years with the fate of Macedonia and I would like to contradict Mr. Dupuis.What we do here is in no way a masterpiece of hypocrisy.We intervened at the right time and I think the Macedonians are very happy.So stop being so detestable and pour a little water into your wine.I think we should approach the thing more positively.Macedonia did not participate in the war.On the other hand, she greatly suffered from the war that her neighbors were engaged and the sanctions which were precisely inflicted on them.She still suffers from it.She also suffered from the influx of refugees during the Kosovo War.This is why it should also be said that the development of Macedonia has, in a rather surprising way, continued to evolve on a democratic basis.It is a country which must overcome in the interior level of serious interethnic problems and which achieves it more and more conclusive.I would clearly like to specify that we can congratulate Macedonia for having designed and applying exemplary legislation today on respect for minorities.Taking into account the 30 % of Albanophones in government action, in government policy and in society represents the essential condition for peaceful coexistence in Macedonia.I am happy that the wish expressed by Mr. Swoboda in his report can be realized at the beginning of March, namely that a delegation of the EU ends up seeing the light of day and that we can finally restore the coat of arms of the European Union.The launch of negotiations relating to the stability and association process is in my opinion the logical conclusion of favorable development which has been carried out in this country.As part of our political commitment, Macedonia must finally be able to observe concretely that its own very meritorious regional cooperation is rewarded by the effective start of regional projects.I will quote just two of the low magnitude: the rapid resolution of the border post problem towards Kosovo in Blace and the development of corridor 8, which goes from Albania to Bulgaria via Macedonia.I find the report of my colleague Swoboda remarkable and I can only join it entirely.Mr. President, I too want to congratulate our Swoboda colleague for his report.I think it is good that many of us support the approach he chooses.This is a structural approach to stability in the region and it is also the content of the agreement provided for with the Republic of Macedonia which we debate today.If the concrete execution of the stability pact must still be set up, the commission has quickly taken care of developing the new instrument called stabilization and association agreement.	fr
The European Union must exercise its entire power over all of its instances so that these and other disputes are included.President!At the beginning of the week, President President announced that full employment will be one of the strategic goals of the Commission for the next five years.He admitted that there are currently 15 million job seeking Europeans and that unemployment is the main source of poverty and social exclusion.Even more, the Portuguese presidency sees the fight against unemployment as a top priority.But all too often, these political priorities are not visible in everyday politics.A typical case is the decision of the Commission to approve the association of ABB-Alstom.The new company has explained its intention to develop a restructuring plan with the aim of savings.This global restructuring plan could lead to loss of up to 12,000 jobs.Especially in my region of the United Kingdom, the consequences of the merger for employment as a result of the announcement of ABB-Alstom to save 270 jobs in Great Britain, of which 95 in Stafford and 112 in Rugby are lost.The company's failure to inform the works council about the merger proposals is particularly worrying.This is particularly important in the case of large international companies, where decisions are made far from the employee.Point 17 of the community's community chart of the social rights of the employees emphasizes the need for consultations, and it is added that this is particularly true in two or more member states.In my opinion, this is not just a community chart.EU law could not be more clear on this question.In such a situation, the Commission would really be good not to simply make its decision based on whether a merger will distort the competition, but also taking into account the social and economic consequences.We need a better coordinated policy in these questions.What we also urgently need is a study to evaluate the impact of mergers in every situation.This is the only way to respected Article 127 of the contract.I welcome the explanation of Commissioner Liikanians, but I also expect the support of this parliament to ensure that the laws we have adopted are strictly implemented on employee rights and that assessments on the effects of intended merger are a matter of course.I have received seven decision -making applications that were earned in accordance with Article 37 paragraph 2 of the rules of procedure.The vote takes place this evening.The pronunciation is closed.(The session is interrupted at 3:50 p.m. and re -accepted at 4:05 p.m.Racist and xenophobic riots in El Ejido (Spain) According to the agenda, the common pronunciation follows the following proposals: B5-0149/201 2000 by Mr. Galeote Quecedo and others on behalf of the Group of the European People's Party (Christian Democrats) and the European Democrats on the racist and xenophobic outbreaks in the area of ​​El Ejido (Spain);B5-0159/2000 of Messrs, Gasòliba I Böhm and Sánchez García on behalf of the faction of the liberal and democratic party of Europe about the racist and xenophobic riots in El Ejido (Spain);B5-0162/2000 by Ms. Díez González and others on behalf of the Group of the Social Democratic Party of Europe about the outbreak of racism and xenophobia in El Ejido (Almería);	de
"Unfortunately, the European Commission has already advanced in its orientations and the position of the Parliament does not weigh heavily in the programs of the period 2000-2006.However, it is necessary to emphasize the need for these funds to aim for priority to the development of countries and regions that encounter the most difficulties and ultraperipheral regions, such as the regions of Azores and Madeira in Portugal, with a view to reaching economic and social cohesion.The truth is that the orientations of the Commission do not fully fulfill these objectives.Furthermore, it is important that there are specific indications and sufficient funds in the fields of quality job creation and with rights, as well as the effective promotion of equal rights and opportunities, in support for the social and solidarity economy, rural development, small and medium -sized enterprises, improving the quality of the life of the urban populations of disadvantaged areas, especially in the social housing sector,sustainable urban development.If the contents of article 158 of the treaty are intended to promote the harmonious development of all communities, it must be said that the total deletion of disparities is still distant.In some cases, as for the Italian regions entering the objective 1, these disparities even increase paradoxically, especially because of the still low approach to community procedures on the part of the structural apparatus and because of the persistent endangered of procedures.Despite normative interventions, the relaxation of community structures must still be carried out.If we do not first carry out an administrative simplification, it is difficult to achieve the community objectives of reforms characterized by efficiency and concentration.In this sense, the Commission's document is incomplete, devoid of any recommendation to the Member States in order to simplify national procedures and legislation in matters of presentation and instruction of projects on the part of the national authorities, as well as in matters of financing, application and control.SMEs, micro-enterprises and craftsmen in particular are still ""weak subjects"", because for them, the legislative and administrative constraints imposed by certain Member States, including Italy, constitute large obstacles to access to structural funds.A large handicap lies in the inability and impossibility of regions and other subjects to program in time.This is why, the Commission, which should have consulted in time the Parliament, under the decision on guidelines 97/99 (Howitt report), in fact found a sort of easy alibi in the constitution of the reduced programming phase within the Member States and published the guidelines in July 1999, long before the newly elected parliament ends its legislative activities, thus preventing it from acting on the current fansDirectors.The intermediate assessment of article 42 of regulation 1260/99 will therefore take on significant importance.Current guidelines generally do not have the merit of being clear and transparent.They only touch up an important question, however: the possibility of measuring the progress made according to verifiable objectives and in total harmony with the strategies of community policies, and do not properly attach to the implications of enlargement, especially since they do not contain specific provisions or clarification in the matter, nor for the regional and national authorities, or for candidate countries."	fr
"We all agree on the conviction of intolerance, but also in the fact that one has to look ahead, and the guilty ones do not have to be sought here, in this parliament or in many other parliaments: the culprits of the events in El Ejido are this minority who wanted to satisfy their vengeance against some immigrants.But one has to take into account that solutions never arise from revenge.The solutions must arise from a functional, social integration and respect for all working there between all authorities and from a determined fight against illegal immigration and a comprehensive respect for the rights of foreign workers who work legally in El Ejido and throughout Europe.President!The present resolution is about solidarity with democratic forces in Spain that fight for the respect of human rights.All Spanish Democrats who feel violated by the events in their country will find our full, unrestricted support.Not only the immigrants were victims of worse riots, but also the democratic system in Spain has been kicked with feet, despite the enormous ability to develop that it has demonstrated in the past 20 years.Immigrants are essential for employers.Their working conditions are so hard and so inhumane that they are not accepted by any Spaniard.Extremely low wages, housing shortages - some live in cardboard huts - lack of opportunities for access to the social institutions, an effective existing apartheid situation - all of this is shameful, unacceptable and incompatible with the necessary respect for every human being.The events in El Ejido are nothing more than racist and xenophobic practices that are no longer permitted in today's Europe.The hunt for immigrants took four days.Women and children were beaten.Hundreds of immigrants who had fled from everywhere have fled to a hill on the edge of the city.It is correct that we put Haider's Austria on the index, but we can not tolerate that small, local ""Haiders"" pursue a policy of racist exclusion and the merciless economic dominance.What has happened in Spain can occur in all of our Union countries if we are not vigilant.We all have the duty to sweep on our own doorstep.I support the present request for resolution, in particular the digits relating to Article 13 of the Amsterdam Treaty, as well as Section 11 of this resolution, in which a connection between the structural funds and the fight against exclusion is established.The European Parliament would be honored to judge these events and to support all proposals for respect for hiking workers in Spain and the entire Union.President, dear colleagues!In the heart of Europe, the flame of racist and xenophobic violence blows up today.This violence is fueled everywhere by extremist movements that gain in influence.We now have to take concrete measures in order to put an end to such violations of physical integrity.None of our societies in Europe can develop fully if it exists in the risk of hatred of hatred of a part of its population against the other part."	de
I can only call the Conference of Presidents to achieve an agreement as quickly as possible as to the right comitological procedure in terms of quotation.This would considerably facilitate the future work of the rapporteurs of this assembly.An amendment proposal was also advanced to the two reports of our colleague from Palacio.Unfortunately, I must say that I will not be able to support this proposal because it affects the substance of the result to which we have unanimously reached in legal committee and the internal market and that I would like to stick to this result from long discussions.To conclude, I thank all the colleagues who supported me, within the Legal Commission, during the development of these reports which were not really easy.I would particularly like to evoke Mr. Wieland, who assumed the ungrateful role of a ghost rapporteur and who took a much more important part than we used to do so to the development of this report by bringing excellent and constructive ideas, without being able to style the rapporteur's laurels.This is why I wanted to focus on this point in this enclosure.Mr. President, I am happy to have the possibility, after the rapporteur's intervention, Ms. Berger, to issue some preliminary remarks before listening, with all the attention required, the following speakers and, if you allow me, Mr. President, to lean more detailed on the various amendments at the end of the debate.Do you allow me to say that the Commission is delighted with the support manifested by the European Parliament with regard to the two proposals in the area of ​​free service for workers from third-party countries, a subject of which we are currently debating?I particularly thank Ms. Berger for the work which she devoted to the treatment of these two proposals which are politically sensitive and constitute a legal challenge.I also sincerely want to thank Ms. Palacio for the important contribution that she made as president of the Legal Commission and the internal market.The Commission is particularly delighted with the suggestions of the Parliament with a view to a more effective procedure for the delivery of the service provision.If the possibility is offered to request this card for one, several or all the Member States, the procedure becomes only more flexible.The Commission also agrees with the proposal to relax the validity duration of the card.However, I believe that a period of three months of work is insufficient to prove that a worker is established in a Member State.The Commission may also approve the determination of cases in which an employment contract concluded between a service provider and its employee is suddenly terminated.The effectiveness of the procedure for issuing this card implies that companies carrying out cross -border services can truly exercise their rights in the domestic territory.It seems exaggerated to give to other Member States, for reasons of public order, the systematic possibility of carrying out checks for the issuance of a card.	fr
"In order to enable further strengthening the role of the European Union as part of international development policy, we consider it necessary to develop three types of measures.The first thing is to increase the efficiency of your development policy.As is known, a overall assessment of development policy took place in 1995, and a conclusion of this overall assessment could be presented during the German Council Presidency.In the most important conclusions, the need for a more closed policy of the European Union and a general strategic perspective of the European Union is emphasized on developmental problems.A special accent is the need for closer coordination and stronger complementarity of the measures, a harmonization and simplification of the organizational framework, in which the Union's cooperation policy takes place today, an effective design of the management for the help and review of its intervention mechanisms, as well as the need to explain the evaluation system and explain it more openly, like this as a helpbecomes.A second aspect would be the need for a greater complementarity between the European Union and the politics of the individual Member States.As is well known, a significant part of the help of the measures of the Member States is used today, which do not always take place and coordinated.And it is precisely this inability to coordinate and complementarity between the projects of the Member States and the planned and carried out measures of the organs of the European Union is largely responsible for the fact that help from the space of the European Union is wasted or not effectively used.In our view, it is also imperative that we are able to do everything in the near future in order to expand mechanisms of complementarity and coordination of the politics and the politics of the European Union pursued by the Member States.A third -party aspect: strengthening and coherence in your policy, the central topic of the pronunciation provided today.First of all, it is clear to all of us that it is not sufficient to create cheaper conditions for the help, and that it is important to better link them with other measures of the European Union, so that the development goals can be achieved not only through help and support, but above all by an integrated view of the individual measures to be contributed to them.As is well known, a council decision was accepted in June 1997, the commission gave the promise to submit evaluation reports.The first report was sent to the Council in May 1999, and some aspects of the coordination of measures have already been determined, especially in the areas of peace insurance, food safety, fishing and migrations.However, as is also known, a communication from the Commission about the coherence together with the notification of ""development policy"" is expected.Of course, in the coming months, even during the Portuguese council chair, the contributions that the Commission on on this topic will also be presented with in the coming months can also be included.It is clear that the coherence of the policies will always remain limited, and of course a certain contradiction between the policies also represents an element of balance and weighing contradictory and contradictory interests that are only possible in the area of ​​the Union, and that it is only possible in this way to also affect a certain contradiction between the policies."	de
"This was never our intention.The fact that we take the negotiations first and before all others with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia shows that we can differentiate and do so.With regard to the regional aid mentioned in the report, we also believe that our technical and financial support should also benefit projects with cross -border or regional dimension.We advocate that an evolutionary clause for the access perspective should be included in the stabilization and association agreement.Such a clause reflects the position of the European Union defined in the conclusions of the European Council of Cologne with regard to its relationships with the countries of the western Balkans.We also consider the greatest possible decentralization of our aid programs to be necessary.As the MPs are known, we are currently developing a new regulation in relation to the support of the European Union for the countries of the western Balkans in order to simplify and rationalize the management of the programs and to summarize all measures in a regulation.I know that in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and elsewhere, you are concerned about the end of the Phare program in these countries, in particular also about the task of the name Phare.I take note of the statements of the members on this topic with considerable concern.I will take a look at this problem again, although I would like to point out that there can really be a confusion with two Phare programs.However, I would like to emphasize that our support for the integration of the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and its neighboring countries to the European family, regardless of the name of the program, is greater than ever.The members of this house certainly share my joy that Macedonia has reached this stage in a relatively short time.I hope that the other countries in the region will strengthen their efforts in order to be able to achieve similar progress.I am looking forward to the other debates that we will lead to this topic in the next few years, and I hope that the focus will be on the success of our efforts in the Balkans, because for me the Balkans is a test stone for what Europe can do in front of its own door.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Patten.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Agreement on the committee proceedings according to the agenda follows the report (A5-0021/2000) by Ms. Frassoni on behalf of the committee for constitutional questions about the agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the modalities of the application of the new decision of the Council of June 28, 1999 - ""Comitology"" (1999/468/EG).Mr President, with the assumption of this agreement between the European Parliament and the Commission on the modalities of the application of the decision regarding the Council, we bring a matter of under roof and subject, which have been scattered by the various institutions of the European Union and are referred to by some of them as a masochist.Since 1993, the modalities for the exercise of the implementation powers transferred to the Commission and in particular the unfathomable and even dubious committee system have sown discord and suspect between the institutions, which threatened to have a serious impact on the legislative process."	de
As is known, the Commission would have already had to present, by 1998, the new proposals on the revision of Directive 97/67 on postal services, aimed at guaranteeing the maintenance of the universal service to ensure its economic sustainability, normalize the gradual liberalization of the postal services market and take into account the repercussions on the categories concerned, workers and users included.To this end, the Commission made studies concerning the cost of the universality of the service, the consequences of the liberalization of cross -border and advertising postal services, the repercussions of the reduction of weight and value limits of the exclusive sector, the impact of the liberalization of the remaining phases - beyond the distribution - of the postal service, as well as the overall evaluation of the results of the studies.Mr. President, therefore, wonders - and, missing Commissioner Bolkestein, I ask the expert Commissioner Monti, who I believe will want to express his opinion -: why not examine, in these studies, the socio -economic impact of the various scenarios foresee for liberalization in each of the Member States?In fact, the postal services are very different in Greece, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands or Belgium.Following liberalization, how can you finance and make the universal postal service of a country like mine, Greece, which has a particular morphology of the territory, taking into account the numerous islands, often inhabited?How can the body in my country be able to survive the universal postal service once liberalized the transfrontier service, which in Greece corresponds to 25 percent and elsewhere less than 5 percent?How will the transfer of the national sector to a foreign country be managed, whose honorable McCartin also spoke?Since this is a very probable event since technological progress makes it increasingly simple and profitable, one should think of a further liberalization, gradual and controlled, with relative fixation of weight and value limits.But what will these limits be?Will it be granted to companies - always skilled in selective exploitation - the right to easily circumvent weight limits, since it is not possible to control the content of the letters?In any case, Mr. President and Mr. Commissioner, we ask the Commission to reveal their cards and present his proposals, analyzing foreseeable developments from every point of view and for all Member States.It goes without saying that liberalization is not an end in itself, but only a means of improving services.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, the proposed liberalization of classical national postal services inevitably leads to ask what the activities that the posts will consider their core business in the future.In other words: what services will the post office want to continue offering?Which activities can carry out internationally internationally?What areas do they intend to dispose?To respond, it must be taken into account that the old monopoly is no longer such de facto following the appearance of numerous couriers and the introduction of technological developments such as fax and e -mail.On the other hand, employment is of fundamental importance in the case of the liberalization of postal services.	it
I would like to know what Europe and you, Mr. Solana, are currently doing it or commemorating in the near future to ban this danger of war: today you can still prevent her - tomorrow it could be too late for it.I would also like to know whether something could not be done in this context to move the Iraqi government into a humanitarian gesture, i.h.that she gives up the whereabouts of the 615 people missing from Kuwait or expenses them if they are in their violence.As we are sitting here, hundreds of thousands of people are in great danger because of the floods in Mozambique.This has not suddenly happened.The floods have been ongoing for weeks, and only now seems to have emerged.The practical support from the community and the Member States has so far been more than modest.For a long time, many have warned that the European Union spends too much time with its potentially dangerous and essentially political project of creating military decision -making structures instead of concentrating their efforts to improve their civilian instruments, especially for humanitarian aid.I recognize the efforts of Mr. Patten in this direction, but it is very unfortunate that the governments of the Member States have not invested as much time to analyze their capacities for disaster relief and humanitarian aid, as they did in the dangerous business of creating military capacity, with which ultimately only parallel structures are created and thus undermined.Of course, there is a connection between the availability of the device and teams and humanitarian aid, but in the armed forces of many European countries there are serious defects in the military area, and for a long time.In NATO, they have started to fix them.So far I have not heard a convincing declaration on security policy, which is why the European Union has to set up autonomous, decision-making capacities for the use of armed forces outside the NATO structures if it does not want to create committees that NATO should compete with.After all, the EU member states are either full-fledged members of NATO, or they are sitting at the table of the Euro-Atlantic Partnership Council.NATO mostly bears European character.At the end, I would like to ask you, Mr. Solana, the question of what the sense is to have the frequently announced strategy planning and early warning unit in the Council Secretariat, if we still react completely surprised when another humanitarian disaster breaks out?President, Mr. Hoher representative, Mr. Commissioner, we have taken note of the particularly reserved and almost compliant attitude of the international community in general and the European Union in particular about the war in Chechnya.What happened in Chechnya and is still happening, but is comparable to genocide.How different should one denote the complete annihilation of a regional capital with 400,000 inhabitants, the incessant and excessive shelling of towns, villages, where - perhaps mixed with some Chechen fighters - the entire civilian population was called?How should one describe the shameful cz -like filtration camps in which the population is exposed to worst humiliations and from which healthy men between the ages of 15 and 65 rarely come out alive?	de
I share its impatience with regard to guaranteeing the total implementation of reform mechanisms and change practices.I would like to be able to honestly tell him that we will write and that we will present communication proposals before 2001 and that we will certainly implement them before 2002, but he must know that consultation procedures and deadlines are legally required and that we must respect them.I don't use it as an excuse.The very positive and constructive answer resulting from the consultation, last month, strongly encourages us, and I believe, therefore, that although the compilation and application of reforms are a slight delay, these reforms will nevertheless be reinforced by the extent of the understanding and commitment which will result from this consultation, consultation that we will assiduously lead.I would like everything to take place much faster.It is better to do it absolutely adequately.Madam President, we admire the vision and realism of Mr. Kinnock because, if he makes us mirroy an efficient and working administration, he does not fail to emphasize the difficulties that will arise and which we must already expect.Mr. Prodi noted that he wanted to disengage from certain tasks.Policy priorities must therefore be defined.I think it is more important to determine what you want to do before you disengage, to avoid putting a large number of people on the back.This is my opinion.In addition, the enlargement of the Union is one of the major challenges.I would also like to point out that peacekeeping will require greater efforts so that a number of people are committed to this ground.The fairly bureaucratic approach that we currently know, in particular in terms of all of our development cooperation, will have to resolutely give way to peacekeeping for peace.Can Kinnock explain what he expects from the Council and the Parliament about the timing of such priorities?I thank Ms. Maes not only for the declaration she has just made, but also for the continuous commitment to which she has shown in favor of the change, since she was part of this assembly.I would like to assure him that our behavior is not guided by any desire to get rid of certain tasks.We focus on essential tasks, on priorities, not in order to elude any obligation, but to guarantee absolutely that we can fully fulfill the central obligations that we have.One of these obligations is very clear - and I agree with Ms. Maes here - it is the preparation for an effective, serene and gentle enlargement, a widening which will serve mutual interests both of the peoples of the adherent countries and the citizens of the current union.Being able to guarantee that we are able to fulfill this absolutely critical role of agents responsible for the widest enlargement which is one of the reasons why we must ensure that we focus very strongly and very intensely on our priorities.	fr
There is no equivocal silence from the council on this subject, Mr. Wurtz.The Council assumes on this subject all the responsibility for the reading he makes of the situation in Cyprus.It was this situation and this reading that decided it, in Luxembourg at the end of 1997, to start the membership process of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union.I would like you to understand that, regardless of decision -making of a more or less emotional nature on this type of question, the daily life of international negotiations normally obliges governments when I say governments I mean all governments to have a slightly more flexible reading.We indeed need positions of a more emotional nature to maintain the scenario in which all these questions projection on the human level.But we must also keep in mind that it is thanks to the rational character of political positions and the flexibility of negotiation that we can find solutions to overcome the big disputes, ultimately originally from certain great tragedies of history.Regardless of the culprits - we are not here to list the culprits, the relevant United Nations resolutions in this area are clear - I believe that we must enjoy, without emotions and with more rationality, opportunities offered by the new situation.The Helsinki European Council has had the courage to make certain decisions and I believe that different parts of these decisions already take up these opportunities duly in that they can, as I said at the start of my introductory intervention, constitute a window of ooportity.It is not by exploiting the tensions, in this negotiation phase, which is a delicate phase, a sensitive phase, that we can obtain concrete results.It is precisely through discreet work, support work of the mission of the special representative of the United Nations Secretary General that we must continue.The position of the European Union in the matter is unequivocal, ladies and gentlemen, and I believe that it is not worth engaging in second readings on possible sentences which could be in the discourse of the council or in another position.We do not play, within this parliament, in politically correct, we play for international level and for what the concrete positions are, defined by the Council, for a long time and consistently, and which the European Commission has also followed with prudence, attention and pragmatism.When we are currently talking about the need to involve the community of the northern part of Cyprus in an exchange of information, in particular on the way to a future membership of the Republic of Cyprus to the European Union, we must know that we are trying to find formulas of a practical nature allowing us to overcome obstacles on the path of a political solution.We are not looking for subterfuges and we do not seek to create, through practical solutions, any models presenting recognition of a political nature.	fr
However, technical assistance remains necessary.It will also be necessary to pay particular attention to the dissemination of results and mutual learning through best practices and mainstreaming.I made sure that the present report meets the widest possible adhesion.This objective has led to the reduction of a number of amendments - from 100 to committee to 22 for the plenary -, which has given rise to numerous compromise possibilities.We even managed to reach a compromise on the issue of asylum seekers.On this subject, however, I ask the president to vote on the equal report on Wednesday instead of Tuesday, so that we can still work on certain points of detail.It seems important to me that this community initiative can start in time and that this report has a large support within this assembly, so that the Commission is also required to take the constructive proposals of the Parliament in consideration.The means intended for Equal have indeed been put in reserve by the European Parliament, so that the expectations of parliamentarians can also affect the community initiative.On this subject, the insistence shown by the European Parliament for a modification of the essential points can only take place after a new hearing of the Assembly is also justified.Equal must deserve his name, this is my firm intention.He must guarantee equal opportunities for all disadvantaged persons from the European Union.He must prevent the dislocation of our society.He must prevent marginalization from being part of everyday life.He must offer anyone the possibility of enjoying a common initiative, regardless of their age, sex and origin.It is my intention and I ask this assembly to provide the widest support to this report.Madam President, the fact that we were taking this debate on the new Urban initiative is a feat in itself, just like my presence among you this evening since Iir France canceled my flight at 2:10 p.m., but I am there!Just a year ago, when the Commission presented its proposals relating to the 2000 agenda, it suppressed the Urban initiative.However, we knew, as men and politicians, that there was a deep support in favor of the continuation of this initiative in the year 2000. Consequently, the Parliament may claim to have carried out a productive pressure campaign aimed at the reintegration of Urban in the order of the day and to have succeeded in changing the commission and the Council to change.Urban policy has always been at the forefront of EU policy.In my Member State, for example, we are developing a strategic approach in a white paper and a Government Task force on urban development examines the problems of urban communities.Eight out of ten people in Europe live in urban areas, so it is just to help our most disadvantaged communities to solve the problems that are far too familiar such as deficiencies, social exclusion, unemployment, crime, drug addiction, and all the problems resulting from it.For example, in my region, in Manchester, the Urban community initiative was fruitful.	fr
"Above all, integration mechanisms should be created.The most important thing is perhaps the development of an infrastructure that is such that the non-expansive industries and peripheral population groups can also participate.That is why, in my opinion, the computer equipment of the primary schools, a broadband network for the thin -populated areas, public technical libraries and a public sector should be invested, which must not be reduced, but on the contrary must be strengthened.President!You can only become dizzy on the agenda of the European Council in Lisbon, which takes place on March 23 and 24 March.This only applies to the chapter headings in which the Europe of innovation and knowledge, structural reforms, competitiveness, the European social model, employment, social cohesion, macroeconomic politics and sustainable economic growth are called.It is therefore not surprising that the numerous contributions of the chair, the Commission and the Member States are tend to get bogged down in all directions at the moment.This procedure can lead to two completely different results: Either a comprehensive exchange of very stimulating thoughts is made possible, which everyone then tries to implement, whereby in the new area of ​​electronic business transactions could be taken, - and this possibility would ultimately not be so bad - or the Council wants to show the results of the species that further responsibilities are transferred to Europe, i.e. that is, more centralization and bureaucracydignity what would actually be necessary.When we read the preparatory documents, some fears come to us.From this we-sorry for this gibberish, which does not come from me-that it is a better convergence of the Cologne process regarding the coordination of the macroeconomic policies, the cardiff process regarding structural reforms and the Luxembourg process with regard to the coordination of the employment policies, while also the employment pact and multilateral monitoring of theHousehold policies with a substance in content.How can such a better convergence of all of these different processes be ensured?In the conclusion of the document of the Council Presidency on January 12, the key is delivered.The basics of economic policy - which currently only have the status of annual recommendations to the council to the Member States - would have to be reformed in order to expand their scope and, above all, I quote: ""To form their character as a framework even more"".The word ""frame"" should obviously be understood in its double meaning, namely as a summary and obligation.Are we not with these total documents to reinvent the GOSPLAN?This question is justified, especially if you read the French contribution, which goes a little further towards Dirigism, by proposing to coordinate a whole series of national policies, for example in the areas of employment, social security and SME, in Brussels and to present a wealth of quantified indicators, which then be monitored.Such a central control would lead to renewed violations of the principle of subsidiarity, to re -standardization of details, to other coordination, which, despite their different situations, ultimately lead to new rigid rules that would still be added to those in the area of ​​uniform currency."	de
"Italy, for example, in recent years, has encountered difficulties in the use of structural funds, especially due to excessive bureaucracy, a lack of information and the almost absent involvement of economic and social operators at the local level.There are therefore two points to which I would like to attract the attention of the Commission: first of all, it is necessary to use the consultation as best as an instrument of coordination and participation in the decisions of local and regional operators, precisely in order to avoid imbalances and inequalities.Second, it is really necessary to simplify and make administrative processes more transparent, which too often present an unnecessary length and complexity to the point of prejudice access to funds, something of which small and medium -sized European enterprises complain.I conclude, Mr. President, claiming that it is quite serious that the Commission, in his communication, has only paid little attention to territorial pacts and especially to the methods of combating unemployment among women and young people.Mr. President, like my colleague, Mr. Evans, I am delighted that the first speech that I come to pronounce before this assembly relates to such an important subject, in particular because I represent part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has so far benefited from the funds of lens 2. But the report presented this evening in the Parliament is an excellent example of what, if we do not see,Lack of the substance necessary to be relevant for people by benefiting directly.The report itself starts from a good intention, but, as often happens when we deal with these subjects, lacks clarity as to its objective and a solid base for its operation.This is why my group and I offer three key amendments and additions to the text.It is not a question of removing anything from the proposal but of making it more relevant for those which it intends to guide.I would like to explain our thought.First, we care about the proper use of structural funds and the cohesion fund.The experience of the past shows that we should and we must, as elected deputies of European taxpayers, demand financial probity and transparency in the payment and control of the sums allocated.Our amendments and adds therefore aim to establish indicators of what we know under the expression ""to have it for your money"" in the process of granting credits.Then, we see far too often that we spend huge sums in projects whose outcome is inevitably uncertain at the start of the program period.But halfway through or at the end of this period, there is no effective way to put an end to the project if it has not been fruitful.Our additions therefore require that practical and applicable exit strategies are provided, so that not only can we have the necessary insurance against continuous costs that taxpayers must often bear, but also that we can avoid the syndrome which consists in a bad deal.Finally, we ask for a change in balance and the method of payment of funds."	fr
I would also like to praise the reasonable and flexible attitude of the council.Save according to the agenda is followed by Ms. Ahern (A5-0010/2000) on behalf of the delegation of the parliament in the mediation committee about the joint draft for a decision by the European Parliament and the Council on a multi -year program for the promotion of energy efficiency - Save (C5-0334/1997/0371 (COD)).Ms. President, I would like to thank the Council and the Commission for the successful and thorough implementation of the mediation procedure, in which there was a good atmosphere all the time, which is not always the case.I am pleased to be able to say that I consider the end result to be very satisfactory for the parliament, since all of its amendments have been included in the common text in full or in revised form.The funds ultimately estimated for the program represent a significant improvement compared to the council's proposal in the second reading, which we considered completely unacceptable;We made some progress there.I therefore propose to this house to agree to the suggestions for Save and the conclusion from the mediation in the third reading.I would like to remind the house that we had accepted this report with eight amendments to the second reading, including the reinstatement of the amount originally mentioned by the Commission.The Commission had accepted five of the proposed amendments, including the middle equipment, and I would like to thank the Commission for their continued support in the budget during the mediation procedure, since the council's proposal was unacceptable.In the course of the placement, an agreement on the studies and actions for elaboration, implementation, supplement and evaluation of the measures of the community could be achieved.Furthermore, compromise formulations were found for five further change applications, including the legislative and non -legislative measures, the inclusion of local energy centers and - very important - from energy balance systems in monitoring progress in the area of ​​energy efficiency.I hope you all agree that this is enormous progress.In the question of financial resources, the Parliament steadfastly defended its position in view of the extremely lean initial offer of the Council.To do this, we had to hold several sessions until the Council finally increased the funds on a noteworthy amount.We enforced an increase by two million compared to the initial amount, which is equivalent to a significant increase in the middle equipment.I can recommend this central equipment and the Commission has promised to follow the program afterwards.This played an important role in our considerations.However, I would like to make it clear that this is a very modest financial framework and has always been and that the financing is more symbolic than corresponds to the real requirements.The financing of the energy savings still comes from the Member States for the most part.We have to keep that in mind when we say goodbye to this program.If what we can achieve at community level is more symbolic than real, it is unfortunate because there is a lot of enthusiasm for measures, including community measures, for energy saving at the local level.However, the community can do one thing, namely to bring the local actors into contact with each other so that the wheel is not reinvented in every region.	de
Taking into account that the contribution of the European Social Fund for the 2000-2006 period will amount to 2,487 million euros and that the Equal initiative is joint financing with the Member States, what will be the contribution rate of Greece?- (El) The equal initiative is not limited to certain groups of people.It is proposed to deal with discrimination in the workplace.The decision to launch this initiative was taken in Berlin and there it was decided to take into consideration and include in their actions the professional groups of asylum seekers.I mention it as an important aspect of this initiative.The community initiative program of each of the Member States has to comply with the regulations, which are the same as the regulation of the European Social Fund, that is, the Equal initiative is addressed to the European Social Fund Regulations.It has been presented to Parliament and we wait next month the opinion of Parliament.I must emphasize that the Equal initiative responds to national needs and national plans, which are defined according to the agreed European strategy.Responsible in the first instance of the constitution of common agencies, for the presentation of the proposals, for the election of the persons who will materialize the programs - and also of the control in the first instance - are the national governments.In the European Commission, the General Directorate of Employment has powers on the application, while the financial control will be exercised, of course, by the General Directorate of Financial Control, as well as by the European Office to Fight Fraud and by the Court of Auditors.The last question refers to the amount granted.Greece has been granted 98 million ECUS and the obligation of participation is 80%, while for the island regions, and especially for the most remote Greek islands, the participation of the initiative reaches 85%with its own corresponding participation of 15%.Mr. President, I am of the opinion that the guidelines on the Equal community initiative, and especially the four actions described therein, lead to a very complex bureaucratic scheme and, paradoxically, little transparent.For example, one wonders in what way an association for development may demonstrate that it has a spirit of collaboration or ability to represent as action 2 in paragraph 33 of the guidelines.On the other hand, the obligatory nature of interstatal collaboration and the complex demands for planning and the expression of an association for development fatally refer to large formations, which are the only ones that can respond to such demands.This, however, comes into contradiction with the proclaimed will of the general objectives, which contemplate decentralized action plans, and, precisely in the field of local administration and rural world.And in addition, at the same time, it makes the participation of the really more disadvantaged - as asylum seekers, emigrants and others - impossible or merely symbolic.Finally, if the global amount is considered, which is rather small -2,800 million euros for 15 countries and objectives so ambitious -I fear that the only thing we will finally achieve will be to demonstrate that unemployment is a very bad thing.- (El) In the first place, I would say that since we are in the elaboration phase by Parliament, it will really help us to make us concrete proposals, which will be taken by us in consideration.Secondly, I have to say that the objective of the Equal initiative is not the reduction of unemployment.This initiative cannot consider the issue of unemployment reduction, nor support for job creation.	es
The commission has been urged, and thus will do in the first half of next year, to present a report on the march of the adaptation of the internal law of the Member States to the decision, and also about whether the seriousness of the matter is reflected in the action of the States.It has already been pointed out that this framework is a decision adopted in the field of criminal law.To this extent, this novelty must be recognized, this step, although you, Mr. Schulz, indicated that complementing such an old agreement is not a step too brave.On his question, in the opinion of the commission, the Framework decision rests on a legal basis quite a lot in the market: in the opinion of the Commission, the correct legal basis is applied.In addition, the Framework Decision must be completed from now on through other legal acts.The Commission will present a proposal for regulation related to cooperation between all competent authorities and cooperation with Europol.This proposal must provide for an obligation to collaborate and regulate the obligation of the national authorities to notify cases of currency forgery and deliver the false money to the European Central Bank for identification and classification, in order to be able to adopt effective measures in this regard.On the question of the coordination of the different measures: since the beginning of 1998 the commission collaborates (and hereafter, the Olaf will do) with the experts in the subject of the Member States of the European Central Bank and the Europol to be able to fight in advance in advance and effectively against the falsifications.On the part of the Commission, a few weeks ago, Mr. Karras, has already pointed out the proposal of an information campaign on the euro, which would be allocated, at least 32 million euros.This is a volume of resources that can be applied effectively, that is, a large volume of resources;Of course, in this information campaign will occupy a preeminent place the protection of the euro against falsifications.I believe that this debate also contributes to all money forgeners who think that their time has arrived at this late hour because the EU does not remain awake, they are noticed thanks to this debate shortly before midnight.Thank you very much, Mrs. Commissioner Schreyer.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.(The session is suspended at 23.50 hours) Resumption of the session The minutes of the session yesterday has been distributed.Is there any observation?(The act is approved) Mr. President, I want to make an observation regarding a meeting that took place last night among several deputies of this Parliament, without distinction of groups.Several vice presidents and quainers participated in the same, being present the architects who built this hemicycle, to seek ways to continue improving the conditions in which our work is developed.We discover, at that meeting, that this curtain located behind you, Mr. President, actually hides a window.Now, it seems that, if opened, we could contemplate a magnificent show on the river;But we have explained that it was kept closed to avoid the comptroller, so that the hemicycle was better illuminated during the debates.	es
"Due to the size, unpredictability and irrationality of the global foreign exchange markets, it is becoming increasingly difficult to master the economy at national and regional level.Computer -controlled sales programs were sufficient to turn a random flashing into an avalanche on the screen, under which jobs, life and entire industry were buried in all parts of the world.The only arguments that speak against them are: First, the efficiency of the foreign exchange markets would be affected - one can hardly imagine in view of the enormous pace with which capital is moved back and forth and the annihilation of jobs all over the world, in East Asia, Europe and Latin America.Mr. Chirac has once referred to those who are involved in this business as the AIDS virus of the global economy.We have to sprinkle a little sand in the gearbox of currency speculators, stock exchange brokers and option dealers.Of course, this cannot achieve a single country nor the currency union, but it is possible at an international level and through worldwide cooperation.In my view, Europe, Japan and the United States, the euro, the Yen and the dollar would be such a block.I am disappointed with the PPE.I thought the members would at least read the applications for the resolution they want to vote on.Yes, I support such a tax, but we won't vote on that tomorrow.Tomorrow we will only decide whether the Commission should be commissioned to examine this area and check which steps and requirements would be necessary for the introduction of such a tax.As far as I heard, the commission member also rejects such a tax.However, I cannot understand why he does not welcome a study of this topic, because after all, the result could underpin his position.There is nothing worse than a prefabricated opinion.According to a survey by ""War on Want"", 47 % of all citizens in the United Kingdom support this tax.In France, this proposal has come across an overwhelming response, especially in connection with the claim to use the income to reduce debts and to relieve poverty in the Third World.This topic can no longer be ignored by Parliament, Council and the Commission.A large part of the public now requires a better answer than: ""There has never been such a tax."" In the new millennium with its new problems, which require global solutions, the citizens demand good arguments, which is why such a tax cannot be introduced, and they do not want to hear what reasons so far.Ms. President, Commissioner, Varier colleagues, a political compromise from the benefits of taxation of international financial transactions would be a first step towards the indispensable redesign of numerous international regulations.One of the most important demands of the demonstrators in Seattle was exactly the introduction of this type of tax, and this is no coincidence.Proposing them now would be a strong signal of the rich European countries that show that they want to give up their selfish attitude, Mr. Commissioner.According to everyone, such a solidarity tax represents a commendable measure that does not hinder trade, but primarily aims at speculation transactions and their bad effects, revered colleagues from the right -wing parties."	de
Is the commission proposed an action plan to increase the active participation of women in environmental decisions?The Commission has, since 1988, an action plan for equal opportunities for women and men.With the current program, which includes from 1997 to 2000, it is tried to develop a culture in which male and female values ​​are integrated and in which the specific needs of each sex are taken into account.One of the objectives of the program is to prepare and control methods, strategies and measures that promote the equitable distribution of the sexes in the decision processes, including, in the high positions.Within the framework of this program, each General Directorate prepares a specific action plan.One of the objectives of the Action Plan is to increase the number of women in management positions.The new commission has as a goal to double the number of women in headquarters during their legislature.The General Directorate of Environment, in which currently 60 percent of directors and 20 percent of department leaders are women, is especially active in this area.Our policy is to favor the incorporation of women into administrative positions, to create a reserve of ideal candidates for future management positions.Currently, 24.5 percent of our category A employees are women.We hope this proportion continually grows.In addition, we make efforts to attract qualified women to participate in our discussion forums.With regard to our external partners, we can only give them good examples and urge them to make efforts to democratize their decision processes.Regarding more general issues about the integration of the perspective of equal opportunities between men and women, they surely know that this principle is established in the Amsterdam treaty.Article 3 of the treaty stipulates that the community, in everything that concerns that article, must aim to eliminate deficiencies and promote equal opportunities for men and women.The Commission gives its support to the efforts made in this area and is studying what specific measures can be adopted in environmental matters.Obviously, I want to take advantage to say that I value the role of the Women's Rights Commission of the European Parliament and, especially, its president.Allow me only to remember that when the current commission was approved, the Women's Rights Commission asked each commissioner how they would deal with equal opportunities between men and women in their work area.We are going to carefully control each of the commissioners;In this way I want to warn others too.Thanks for the answer.I interpret it as a yes, as it is an action plan that is necessary;An action plan to incorporate more women in specific environmental fields.Also allow me to say that Beijing's statement underlines the importance of having an institutional capacity to include the perspective of equal opportunities in all environmental programs.	es
"Things being clear, it is now necessary to hope that the improvement in the climate of relations between the European Union and Turkey and Greco-Turkish relations will favorably influence the Turkish Cypriot community and that it will raise its refusal to send representatives to the membership negotiations.The presence of such representatives would in no way prejudge the final political solution.On the contrary.It would enable the interests of all at a time when Cyprus, inserting itself into the European Union, is about to take a decisive turning point in its history.Mr. President, I would also like to associate myself with the joy expressed by the other speakers with regard to the best possibilities available in the continuation of the development of Cyprus as relations between Turkey and the EU as well as between Turkey and Greece.In my opinion, the EU must constructively contribute to this evolution.I also consider it - and this point has already been mentioned - that certain problems related to the financial regulations should be resolved.I mean here pre -prédhesion credits, which in my opinion, in my opinion, section 7. The assembly had exceptionally accepted last year to place the credits intended for these expenses in section 4 so that Cyprus and Malta are not treated as an equal with the candidates from Central and Eastern Europe when they should be in accordance with the declarations made at the Helsinki summit.Resources must therefore be assigned to section 7 for which financial prospects must be revised.This is the salient point.It is essential that the credits allocated as a help of pre -pricing for Cyprus and Malta come from section 7 and that financial prospects are the subject of a revision, because if the council refuses this principle, it will act in contradiction with its own decisions taken in Helsinki in December.As for the amount which appears in the Brok report - 130 million euros - I would like to declare, on behalf of the Liberal group, that we must first negotiate the volume of this amount.The main thing, in this regard, is to guarantee a multi -year program, which is part of the adequate section in order to start the preparations for membership of Cyprus and Malta.Mr. President, the Greens of Greens/European Free Alliance supports the decision adopted by the European Council of Helsinki according to which the resolution of the conflict cannot constitute a preliminary condition for the membership of Cyprus.It is necessary to maintain a strong pressure on the Cypriot government, but the will of the majority of the population cannot be the subject of a blackmail of another part of it, even if we emit great doubts about the representativeness of the government of this part of the island.It is obvious that the opportunity window - the ""Janela de Oportunidades"", of which the presidency spoke - must be exploited to the maximum.However, we are also convinced that, although Greco-Turkish relationships have improved, this cannot be sufficient."	fr
Berger report (A5-0007/2000) This proposal for a directive aims to establish the conditions for the detachment of salaried workers nationals of a third state as part of a delivery of cross-border services.Indeed, nationals of third countries legally staying in a Member State do not enjoy the right to free movement within the European Union.Until now, extracommunications workers have been seriously faced with obstacles to their free movement within the European Union.It is therefore positive that we facilitate the circulation of workers in the European Union, even if they are nationals of third countries.However, the proposal for a directive targets only their displacement in another Member State if they are in detachment regime on behalf of an employer established in a country where he has his usual residence, so that the possibility of circulating is limited to the detachment period, and only in the Member State where it was detached.This means that the fundamental concern for this proposal is not to solve the problem of circulation of these workers but only to create better conditions for companies providing services.On the other hand, the Berger report introduces, in the name of the simplification of procedures, questionable profound changes, in particular the creation of a common information system giving access to the cards issued by the authorities of all the Member States Berger Report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger (A5-0012/2000).It is with the greatest satisfaction that I welcome the two proposals for directives which aim to facilitate the free movement of working -class workers from third countries while facilitating the free movement of services.Essentially, these proposals introduce the service service/which will allow, in the future, nearly 5 million third -party nationals legally residing in a Member State of the European Union, to provide services in other Member States, something to which problems are today, such as obtaining visas and work permit.The first proposal for a directive will authorize companies established in a Member State who employ third -party working -class workers to temporarily detach these employees in another Member State to provide services.Under the provisions provided, the employer would simply be required to apply for a service provision for each worker concerned.Logically, to be able to hold such a card, the worker must reside legally in a member state and be covered by a social security scheme.The second proposal gives the same rights to the self -employed workers from third countries.If, on the merits, I adhere to the proposals of the European Commission, it is true that certain provisions could be confusing.This is why, I vote in favor of the amendments deposited by the rapporteur.This will clarify the provisions and thus prevent any abuse!Other amendments aim to simplify administrative procedures, for example by authorizing the Member States to appoint a single authority responsible for the issuance of cards.Such a modification seemed essential to me to avoid administrative heaviness which too often slow down the right application of new provisions.	fr
That is our job for the Balkans.The Union must prove its ability to expand the space of security, peace and freedom and to play a major role on the world stage to the Balkans and the rest of the world.Of course, we come back to the expansion again, which must be realized by expanding the space of security, peace and freedom at the same time.We promised a lot in this direction, but I think that we can keep our promises, although there is an extremely difficult way to get ahead.The expansion that will accompany us for the entire five years and beyond - I think of the hopes of the accession candidates - must take place on the basis of secure and objective criteria, although we also have to offer guarantees to the citizens in these countries and more.The expansion will be characterized by friendship, impartiality and opening, but also by compromise.I say it again: We have to offer the citizens in the countries willing to join, but even more public in our countries.Our responsibility does not end during the expansion, it does not end in the Balkans.There are some other problems of essential importance: the relationship to Ukraine, the relationship with Russia, our neighboring countries, or the big problem of the relationship to the southern Mediterranean area, which will be decisive for the history of Europe, for peace and security for future European generations.In this sense, we are responsible for the entire African continent.Africa has recently hoped that Africa has been submitted, but nothing concrete has been accomplished there;In Africa, no transition from totalitarian to democratic regimes, but vice versa from democracy to totalitarianism in recent years;For us, Africa is a worrying conflict stove.That is why we have to perform another task at an international level that has already been addressed by the responsible commissioner for trade: We have to work for the resumption of the millennium round, with a comprehensive willingness, as we had already adopted and suggested it before Seattle, which we were unable to put into practice - the willingness to take on some problems for the poorest countries, whichNot only affect debt, but also the one -sided opening for trading with the poorest countries in the world.We have to find a different solution, otherwise events like those in Seattle will repeat themselves and prevent the Union from playing a positive role in history.The Union has to be guided by respect to the principles of freedom, respect for human rights and the rights of minorities in the world.Let us remember that we, the European Union, are a Union of minorities: we are all minorities in Europe.Benefits are also noticeable among us fifteen, which can also be repeated in the coming decade.I speak of Austria, where the Commission lived up to its role, which consists of acting for the cohesion of the Union, but this is uncompromising and as a guardian of the contracts, ready to punish every little violation of the principles of democracy, the rule of law and respect for minorities.	de
"I would also like to move towards a linear career system since the current system of categories no longer adapts to the needs of our institutions.Certainly, it blocks the progress and mobility of people with proven abilities.Those of their lordships who during the course of this debate have praised the commission officials, who typically and mostly are completely complete, have great capacity and are excellent workers, have made absolutely successful comments.While the White Paper on the strategy for reform will profile our ideas about these and other issues, it is evident that details and details are essential.Therefore, a series of communications will appear over the coming months.Each of them will be available to this Parliament for reflection and response.Meanwhile, it is clear that it will be necessary for us to work closely with Parliament, as an institution, in essential matters, especially wages and pensions and the review of personnel regulations.Regarding this last issue we are considering whether it would be useful to adopt a framework regulation that established common provisions for the most important issues such as wages, conditions, personnel representation rights etc., but that allows the different institutions to be acting promulgating rules for other issues.The first impressions of Parliament regarding this idea would be especially welcome.I finish referring to paragraph 15 of the resolution before the Parliament concerning the necessary resources for our policy for change.Of course, this is the greatest importance.We are sure that an important ""reform dividend"" will arise as reform measures begin to promote greater efficiency and better management of the use of resources.It is very clear, however, that some sectors of the commission's services are already deployed to the limit.Parliament has frequently commented on this circumstance.Secondly, it is also clear that the reform will require some new investments for technological training and skills.Third, it is very clear that more preparations for expansion have to be undertaken.These are already having an impact on the availability of resources.It is also evident that, if we accept new tasks - how council and parliament will ask us to do - we must identify the so -called ""negative priorities"" and abandon them to create savings capacity.A fundamental element of the reform will therefore be a more rigorous procedure to knot the process of establishing priorities to the allocation of resources under a management system based on the activity.I would like to emphasize, however, that while the Commission will surely introduce internal discipline in the establishment of priorities, it can only be completely effective if the Parliament and the Council share it and adopt an equally strict attitude regarding what is demanded by the commission.Therefore, the Commission greets paragraph 15 of Mr. Van Hulten.Term, Mr. President, thanking the Assembly for the attention given during an inevitably long intervention and expressing my gratitude to the speaker, the Budget Control Commission and the rest of the commissions that gave their opinion.We hope to continue collaborating closely with this assembly in the conclusion of the package of strategies for reform and, most importantly, continue working with this assembly in its execution throughout the years that will be necessary in complex situations of this type."	es
Here then that we are giving meaning to many fragments in Lisbon.We are giving it I believe because the Portuguese presidency pulled the wires of unification, putting together the different mosaic cards.Now we have this heritage and I hope that, in Lisbon, we will find the unit to put it into practice, because I believe we need it and we will also have unexpected fruits.Many thanks, Mr. President of the Commission, many thanks, Mr. President in office for the Council, for the significant contribution to an important and interesting debate.I inform you that you have received six resolution proposals, submitted pursuant to article 37, paragraph 2, of the regulation.The vote will take place on Wednesday, at 12.00.The discussion is closed.(The session, suspended at 8.15 pm, resumes at 9.00 pm) Before resuming the session, I would like to make an observation that I usually do in the night sessions, but since the faces change, many of those present are not yet aware of it.I address a prayer, that is, to contribute to the good performance of the works by reaching the time of speech that has been granted to you.The reasons are three.The first is the old rule of each party: the late is late, the more you have fun - but this does not apply to the plenary.The second reason is that the interpreters, sitting behind the windows of the cabins, also want to go to sleep.The third reason is that in addition to the interpreters there are many other people who work behind the scenes and must remain until the end of the session, for example to ensure that the verbal process is ready for tomorrow morning.Here, please anticipate you at the time of word Imprortivi, so we will proceed quickly.Environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries The agenda bears the recommendation for the second reading, (A5-0051/2000), of the Commission for Development and Cooperation, on the common position defined by the Council (12485/1/1999 - C5-0013/2000 - 1999/0020 (COD)) in view of the adoption of the European Parliament regulation and the Council concerning actions intended to promote total actions to promote total actions.Integration of the environmental dimension in the development process of developing countries (speaker: honorable A. Wijkman).Mr. President, since the 1987 Brundtland report we know that a policy aimed only at economic growth is not and cannot be sustainable in the long term.The challenge that awaits all of us, therefore, consists in the integration of social sensitivity and ecological sensitivity.This implies, among other things, the impossibility of considering ecological sensitivity as a sectoral problem, and the need for any negative consequences of industrial production, transport and construction to be addressed already in the design phase, reducing their impact to minimal through various types of measures.The Rio conference has led to the development of an action program in which, sector by sector, the main problems are listed in this context and in which solutions are expected to guarantee the protection of the environment and natural resources.Although it is a document of various hundreds of pages, it still remains a generic program.	it
Modernization of social protection in accordance with the agenda, the report of the report is proceeded (A5-0033/2000), by Mr. Andersson, in the name of the Employment and Social Affairs Commission, on the communication of the Commission: a concerted strategy to modernize social protection (com (1999) 347 - C5-0253/1999 - 1999/2182 (COS)..(SV) Mr. President, social protection is an important issue.This is an obvious consequence of cooperation in the community.The base is monetary cooperation, which has later been followed by macroeconomic cooperation and in matters related to employment policy.Now it is obvious to continue with the social protection system.These sectors are interdependent.Economic stability serves as a basis for growth and can give rise to an increase in employment.It also makes it possible to develop the welfare state.However, the opposite situation can also occur: a well -developed social protection policy can contribute to increasing employment and growth.Social security is, in other words, a productive factor.There are differences in the community in social protection.Many of them have historical history.However, today we face a series of common challenges.For example, demographic development, in which not only increases the number of elders but also reduces birth.The labor market also changes.Women are increasingly incorporated into the labor market.Another challenge is technological development.We have to deal with these challenges jointly.The communication of the Commission proposes an increase in the exchange of experiences, the formation of a high -level group and the realization of the benchmarking.In addition, the Social Protection Report is published annually and examined together with the Employment Report.This is helpful, but it is not enough.We propose a procedure such as the Luxembourg process.Clear guidelines and indicators are needed, at the same time that Member States must create methods in national action plans.We create a common model, but we maintain the principle of subsidiarity.Social convergence is a process that will be developed for a long time.Therefore, we must involve Parliament in this work, not making it part of the high -level group, but allowing representatives of Parliament to follow the work of the high -level group and present proposals related to the development of the process.The commission's proposal, like the cooperation in employment matters, is based on four pillars.These are: make systems favor employment, make the sustainable long -term pension system, promote social integration and guarantee high quality and sustainable health.All this is important.In our report we have especially highlighted the importance of the fight against poverty in the EU field and finding indicators, as soon as possible, so that we advance in this matter.Equal opportunities between men and women do not have a pillar.Here the mainstreamer is applied.For this reason, aspects related to equal opportunities must be found in the four pillars.We have done so.We propose many things, for example, to move on to an individualized social protection system, that birth permits allow parents to achieve benefits in the social system, better possibilities to coordinate family and work life and that retirement pensions guarantee decent living standards.	es
It is about aligning the examination regulations, but actually also about minimum standards.In a sense, I regret this. Of course, traffic safety is very important on road, rail or inland waterways, and in view of the international character of this transport, it is necessary to harmonize the training courses for security consultants and the requirements, for example in the upcoming new ADR.I think that is important as the implementation.Of course there are good reasons why we have to pay special attention to this problem.Think of the accidents that have occurred in road traffic in recent years.In Belgium, the Netherlands and other countries, dangerous goods transporters continued to drive on the side of the road despite the fog and, as it would have been necessary in view of the circumstances.Or think of shipers of Eastern European ships that anchor and from which are obviously dangerous.In addition, controls in Belgian, Finnish as well as in Japanese ports show that 50 % of the containers with sometimes dangerous load are not delivered properly.In short, a serious problem.As for the security advisors, such a consultant has been prescribed in the company in some countries since January 1 of this year.The implementation is currently associated with difficulties, especially in small companies, because they cannot afford such a place.Either you sell your cargo or mix with a different load, which leads to a number of problems.The recording of these activities in the form of annual reports or operating analyzes and possibly the inclusion in the certification according to ISO 9002 is also required. The actual work is done, now it is about implementation.Allow me a last hint.With regard to this implementation, we also have to make appropriate agreements with the Eastern European countries, since they will only join the corresponding agreement from July 1, 2001, i.e. in a year and a half.This gives them temporary competitive advantages.Although I do not find this bad, in particular, we should give priority to the safety aspects of the dangerous goods transport on the street, rail and inland waterways, pick up this part of the acquis as soon as possible and present the states willing to join.President, the Parliament rightly deals with traffic safety.The constantly increasing amount of goods promoted by Europe is open or hidden a danger to personnel and society. People who are faced with this danger must therefore meet high requirements.With the standards anchored in a different guideline, 95/35/EC, people should be able to advise against the transportation of dangerous goods.To my delight, the Council also consists of minimum requirements for their examination, although I would have preferred uniform binding standards and regulations with the aim of the aim of internationally equivalent.However, this does not seem to be feasible.Summa Summarum I think the amendment submitted by the rapporteur in every respect and can therefore fully support it.President, Ms. Commissioner, dear colleagues!First I would like to congratulate the colleague Koch on his reports, which may be technical reports, but are very important for the security.	de
Do you consider, Mr. Commissioner, that the data we have about infant mortality in Kosovo - the highest in Europe - and in general the image of misfortune and human disaster in Kosovo is not seriously damaging our credibility and that does not question our ability to carry out what we have promised?And, Mr. Commissioner, the so -called humanitarian military intervention, is justified by the current image of Kosovo's humanitarian disaster?Do not you think so much inertia cannot be justified when this same right to life is at risk?I do not believe that our reconstruction agency or the operational units before it, which have made huge efforts in Kosovo, consider as a successful description of their work the suggestion that their intervention has consisted of remaining crossed with arms.I am sure that your honor did not mean that.It goes without saying that his honor is right in stating that the credibility of the union will depend on what happens, not only in Kosovo, but in the entire region of the Balkans.I am very concerned that the help we provide arrives as soon as possible and so that it enhances our assistance to the maximum.I would only like to make two observations about the situation in Kosovo, which we deal with all the enthusiasm we can together with WHO.In the first place, I am sure that their honor recognizes that during the period of the 1990s, the Belgrade Government cut the funds for Kosovo health service, and many Albanians discovered that they were not receiving any type of health care.As a result, a parallel health system was created through the mother society Teresa.Therefore, we are talking not only about the consequences of the conflict, but about the consequences of years of negligence and a lack of chronic investment.Secondly, and I am sure that their honor will also recognize this, some of the tragic stories from Kosovo during the last weeks did not deal with infant mortality during childbirth, but of child mortality after the birth of a healthy child.These are cases in which women have tragicly killed their own children during hostilities or before hostilities.We are talking about a terrifying story in Kosovo.We must make all possible efforts in the field of healthcare, among others, to restore rules that approach a civilized approach and civilized behavior, but it will not be an easy task.Mr. Commissioner, I have to thank him for his answer to the first question of my colleague and also to the additional question.However, the contacts that I keep in Kosovo tell me that the food packages that are distributed, among others, through echo often have a very small quality.In some cases they have even found insects in food.Are you aware of it?Are you willing to do something to avoid it?This is my first additional question.My second question refers to his mention of the reconstruction of the Mitrovica Hospital.	es
Retroactive legislation is perverse legislation, unfair legislation and often impracticable legislation.Most of the democratic parliaments of the free world reject it in principle unless there is an overwhelming public interest, which is clearly not the case at hand.This is why I have requested a nominal vote for this matter.We can verify who is willing to vote in favor of a retroactivity of doubtful legality, which would involve a expensive load for future car buyers and a devastating blow for the European car industry.Mr. President, ladies, once again I want to briefly remember the economic bets of this directive and renew my support for the amendments presented by my colleague Bernd Lange.These amendments imply the advantage - I want to insist on this point - to reconcile obligations with the environment and economic imperatives.The common position of the Council has been to say that car manufacturers should take care of the totality or a significant part of the cost of recovery and recycling.But as Mr. Lange has said very well, this solution is not equitable with European manufacturers.Because I am from a country where there are many automobile manufacturers, I can tell their lordships that it is not possible to impose them, retroactively, the total financial burden of the vehicle set that is currently in use, that is, the load of the costs imposed by 80% of the European Automotive Park.This solution is unacceptable, because these manufacturers could not integrate into their manufacturing procedures and in their costs the environmental demands that we impose today.The common position puts European manufacturers in an unfavorable situation with respect to manufacturers newly arrived in the European market.Without a doubt, if we are not here to defend a certain national interest, a certain industrial pressure group, but we are here to build a competitive Europe in the world market and defend jobs in the economic sectors in which we are truly competitive.For this reason, I ask their lordships to support the amendments presented by Bernd Lange, who will have the support of the European Socialist Party Group because, in effect, they reconcile the set of the present interests -economic interests and environmental obligations -while leaving the free member states regarding the modalities of application of these obligations, because these amendments anticipate that the systems currently applied in the Member StatesYou have to work very well- continue to work.Mr. President, Mrs. curator, the directive proposal on vehicles at the end of their useful life today seeks to guarantee, on the one hand, a high level of environmental protection in the European Union and, on the other, wants to preserve the proper functioning of the internal market in that sector.A word about historical and period vehicles: they must be excluded from the field of application of this directive because I think we will all agree on it.Cars also integrate our cultural heritage.That said, one of the obstacles refers to article 12, that is, to the date of application of the Directive.	es
"During the past year, the Member States of the Union thus naturally decided to implement the concrete measures intended to strengthen the capacity of action of their armed forces, and the informal summit of Sintra, held the day before yesterday in your presence, has just confirmed the main orientations.On this subject, I would have two questions to which your knowledge of files and actors must make it possible to provide enlightening answers for the continuation of our debates and our work.The first question concerns the formation of this rapid intervention force of sixty thousand men, likely, you said, to be implemented for the execution of peacekeeping and strengthening missions, and capable of maintaining them permanently if necessary.For the intelligence of our colleagues, I must indicate here that the corresponding contingents must then be shared by third parties: a third party to prepare the mission, a third party to execute it and a third party to recover, after tests often difficult for staff and equipment.This explains that the first figures indicated in the press, fixing at around 200,000 men the volume of the forces to be constituted, that is to be close to reality, which did not fail to surprise the uninitiated.My first question will be simple and more direct, perhaps, Mr. High Representative, than that of colleagues who preceded me.You know the French proverb ""no money, no Swiss"".Do you really think that union governments are ready to pay the corresponding price when many of them remain at least decided to continue to collect what was called ten years ago ""peace dividends"".My second question will be more technical, but it is important for a most harmonious transfer to the European Union, the responsibilities of the Atlantic Alliance and the Union of Western Europe.You have indicated, in this area, the establishment of three committees, a political and security committee which started today, the military committee.Then, you mentioned its relations with third countries members of the Atlantic Alliance or associate members of Western Europe, but which are not members of the European Union.In the functioning of interim institutions whose establishment has just been decided, can you tell us, Mr. High Representative, what status do you imagine to confer on the members of the Alliance and the States associated with the UEO, I repeat, which are not yet members of the European Union?Could they, for example, have a place, at least observers, within the various political and security committees or the military committee?You know they are concerned about this risk of being isolated and I mean that I understand their desire to participate with you in the completion of this construction.Mr. Chairman, Mr. Secretary General of the Council, as you will understand, we have followed with great interest in this assembly the information that you transmitted to us on the result of the informal meeting of the Defense Ministers which took place in Sintra and its importance in the process of European integration in terms of security and defense."	fr
And so far the restrictions that affect the free movement of extra -community workers in the European Union have been severe.Thus, it is positive that the circulation of workers in the European Union is facilitated, even if they are citizens of third countries.However, the directive proposal is aimed only to allow its transfer to another Member State when they are in a regime of displacement on account of an entrepreneur established in the country where they have their habitual residence, so that the possibility of circulation is limited to the period of displacement, and only to the Member State to which they are highlighted.That means that this proposal does not have as a fundamental concern to solve the problem of the circulation of these workers, but only to create better conditions for service providers.On the other hand, in the Berger report, in the name of the simplification of procedures, deeply debatable amendments are introduced, one of whose examples is the creation of a common information system for access to the cards issued by an entity of any Member State.Berger report (A5-0007/2000) and Berger (A5-0012/2000).(FR) with the greatest satisfaction of the two proposals for directives aimed at facilitating the free movement of workers from third countries and also the free circulation of services.Essentially, these proposals introduce the CE services provision card that, in the future, will allow about 5 million from natives of third countries that legally reside in a Member State of the European Union provide services to other Member States, which today prevent problems such as obtaining visas and work permits.The first directive proposal will authorize the companies established in a Member State that employ national workers of a third state to temporarily make those employees move to another Member State to provide services.In the terms of the planned provisions, the employer will only have to request a service provision card for each worker.As is logical, to be entitled to this card, the worker will have to legally reside in a Member State and be covered by a social security regime.The second proposal confers the same rights to national independent workers of a third state.Although deep down I adhere to the proposals of the European Commission, I recognize that some provisions could create confusion.Therefore, I will vote in favor of the amendments presented by the rapporteur.Thus the provisions will be clarified and abuse will be avoided.Other amendments are proposed to simplify administrative procedures, for example, by authorizing member states to designate a single competent authority for the issuance of the card.This modification seems indispensable to avoid the administrative slowness that too often slows the good application of new provisions.I cannot help but congratulate myself for the adoption of these directives thus modified, because it would be impossible for us to tolerate for a longer time than the legally established people in the European Union face so many difficulties.	es
Scotland as a country is greater than some member states.It has many remote communities on the main island that can only be accessed by road, sometimes badly connected by public transport, sometimes by none at all.These communities depend for their survival of having local facilities, such as a school, a post office and a store.On these last two depend, in particular, the elderly.They are often located at the same point, becoming more viable for the existence of the other.Scotland also has numerous island communities, some of which can be reached by air, but that depend mostly on maritime ferries.It has been calculated that the real cost of taking a letter from Edinburgh to the central highlands equals approximately ten times to bring the same letter from one side of London to another.And equals approximately four times what is actually charged for shipping costs.The further the community is, the greater the difference.This gives the measure of the problem.It is not to oppose liberalization to ask that these factors be taken into account and the continuation of a universal and affordable postal service is allowed.It is for all our remote and island communities, regardless of the European Union are located, and not only by the population of Scotland, so I ask them to preserve the salvation table offered by their postal services.Mr. President, I consider a privilege to replace my colleague, Commissioner Bolkestein, on the occasion of such a high quality debate about postal services.I will try to respond to the debate in accordance with the information provided by Commissioner Bolkestein.I want to reiterate that Monday will be available to the Regional Policy Commission, Transport and Tourism of Parliament.Some deputies, such as Mr. Stenmarck, complain about delays with the new proposal.Others believe that after all it is not so bad that there is a brief pause after the first step towards liberalization.This is, for example, the position expressed by Mr. Berthu.The commission's position is that the new proposal was fundamentally delayed due to internal problems of the commission, which I am sure of Parliament does not completely ignore.But we believe there is a legal obligation to present a proposal.It is the intention of Commissioner Bolkenstein to submit this proposal to the Commission for its approval in the first half of this year.The date of January 1, 2003 scheduled to put into practice the following steps remains feasible.The proposal will take into account the studies carried out and will be set in particular in aspects such as the universality of the service, which I will return within a second.As regards the existing directive and its application, almost all Member States have adopted the necessary legal measures to transpose the directive.There are some problems related to the structure of the regulatory authority and its independence.The application deadline for Member States is January 2003.	es
"We work so effectively and competently "". So, dear Member States, we believe that it is time that the common foreign and security policy between the conclusions of the council, between meter-long communiqués and what we can really do in this field can build a bridge.Thank you very much for the fact that you also have a little more interesting for us in the decision -making process for this.Participation in this debate and your interesting explanations on the topic.I would also like to thank the woman for her presence and for the words she addressed to us.In general, the various factions about the easily determined fact of the underrepresentation of women in the decision -making processes, both in the political and in the economic and social sector.Nobody today denies that women have to participate in political life, in the parties and institutions, but it is not easy for us to achieve agreement on the form in which this participation is to be achieved.Equality between men and women who affect the lives of women and thus society in general means equality in work, both when accessing the employment - which requires equality in training - as well as in the remuneration for the same work, which has been challenged so often and is so far away from reality.We are convinced that the participation of women at the decision -making process for society will be useful as a whole.The woman always brings a different view than the men who contribute to the enrichment and perfection of the overall vision with regard to the best solutions to the problems of daily life, to whose solution to the solution that, like us, are committed.But the difficulty is to find the right solution that allows women to be present in the responsible positions and thus in the decision -making processes.In some countries of the European Union, an mandatory quota regulation has been decided by law, which immediately achieved a more balanced presence of women.However, this should not be the best solution, because there is not always a sufficient number of women who are willing to join a problematic world that is essentially considered masculine because they were traditionally reserved for men.The proportion of women in the political parties does not reach 50 %, not even in the world of work and in the social field.It is much lower, and it is precisely this participation of the base that should promote the presence of women.In addition, there must be a clear and real will so that there are more women who are able and willing to take responsibility and duties in political life, that is, to take over in the decision -making process."	de
"In truth, a hierarchy of oppression was created.Until the same individuals are recognized to all individuals before the law, this inequality will be the cause of discrimination and human rights will be eroded.In the process of expansion of the Union we rightly placed the emphasis on human rights and the protection of minorities.We must not give up this commitment.But we must also look in the mirror and recognize our inadequacies.Yes, the conventions have been signed, but action is required.I would like to propose continuous checks of the observance of human rights, an eternal supervision, not only outside our borders, but also inside.This is the reason why I am in favor of the presentation of an annual report by each Member State, which reports any possible accusation against it and the measures adopted.Because what happens in each Member State happens to each of us.What happens in another part of the world concerns all of us.Pinochet in Chile is as important as Haider in Austria.Human rights and civil freedoms are inextricably connected.Human rights are not isolated, they are connected to our development policies, our economic policies, our internal affairs policies, in reality they are at the center of our democratic functions.I would like to reiterate how much commissioner Patten said: we must commit ourselves, we must inform, instruct and thus make a real and durable change.Mr. President, ""Europe means ideals, values ​​and principles. It is necessary to give space to the spiritual history of Europe. We must jointly restore the values ​​that combine Europe. The spiritual values ​​have spread from Europe to the rest of the world. We must live with our consciences"".This is what he said in this classroom, three hours ago, the President of the Czech Republic, Václav Havel.In a particularly edifying speech, pervaded of knowledge of the human soul, wisdom, knowledge of history and acumen towards the European spiritual and Christian heritage, he has been able to indicate the sources of inspiration for our work in the matter of dignity of man and human rights.We must be grateful if, in our Europe, there are heads of state like Václav Havel.I wish to dwell on two aspects.First, civil society.Havel recalled that in Eastern Europe the communist regimes systematically made civil society to pieces: popular movements, churches, independent unions.This is also what happens in China with the Falun Gong movement and with the Catholic and Protestant churches.This is what happens with Lamaism in Tibet.We must never forget the defense of civil society.I would also like to talk about the death penalty.The European Union, exactly like Sweden from which I come, has built its vision of the human being on the basis of equality, uniqueness and inviolability of human dignity.Based on this principle, the human being must always have the opportunity to repent.It is said to the government of the United States, the government of Russia and the government of China!Mr. President, Mr. President in office for the Council, Mr. Commissioner, I believe that the line that the Member States of the European Union should follow in Geneva is to grant the priority to situations in Kosovo, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, Sierra Leone and China."	it
"President, it cannot go on, something has to be done against these conditions.President!Amsterdam's contract has marked an important goal of the Union, a task that all parliamentarians, the council and the Commission have to take on during this parliamentary term: As already said, creating a space of freedom, security and right.The Council of Tampere, motor and author of this goal has proposed a few target points, but five years as a period of time intended for the realization of the title IV of the contract is too long to wait for the solution that urgently require some problems.My first consideration is that the parliament is not on the side of the important resolutions that are made in this area and that its participation in the process of decision -making must be guaranteed, especially if it is about a project of the citizens, as the Commissioner correctly said.My second consideration is that progress in the adoption of a common asylum system must quickly be made, with which joint procedural standards are accepted and, above all, the currently prevailing confusion between immigration is put to an end for political and economic reasons.The immigration laws that have recently been adopted in my country, Spain, or in Belgium warn us to tackle the communication of immigration policy urgently.My third and last reflection is related to the Union's foreign policy in the area of ​​immigration and asylum.We are allowed to and we cannot give the impression that the Union strives to defend itself against an avalanche of refugees and economic immigrants.We have to stand up for a policy of development cooperation with our eastern and Mediterranean neighboring countries, but we have to do it conscientiously, with economic means and in close cooperation with the public institutions that work together in the protection of citizens who want to see or emigrate their most fundamental rights because it is about their most elementary needs.After all, as far as the Charter of Fundamental Rights is concerned, it is necessary that European citizens identify their citizenship.It is not enough to have the euro or employment, not even security is everything.You need the ""European soul"", as a well -known Spanish professor said.President, in contrast to some previous speakers, I would like to come back to the words of our Portuguese ministers and the statements by Mr. Vitorino.As Mr. Ceyhun said, the explanations of this gentlemen were music in our ears.As in music, fine -tuning and coordination are also necessary here.Many of us look very optimistic about the six months ahead of us.The citizens of Europe will listen to our melody and they will want to hear the right melody.As mentioned this afternoon, it will take a while before we can remove the missions that we have heard during the European elections and over the past few months.The project of Amsterdam and the council meeting of Tampere continued the project to create a space of freedom, security and law in the European Union.However, one area is of enormous importance, and Parliament must be included in this area: control."	de
"Finally, it is necessary to go further in development aid policies in the less advanced countries.With regard to financial statements and on the financial plan, regarding the debt, helping to delicate sectors such as food and humanitarian safety or education and health, in the field of the environment, investments or access to information and new technologies, as well as in the commercial sector, while guaranteeing global consistency of development policies with other community policies and also among the one, the other and related policies carried out by the states.members.We cannot please us to give continuity to what, in the past, has proven insufficient and incorrect.Mr. President, today after listening to the Council and the Commission, I had to look at my agenda.There is precisely ""consistency of the various policies of the union with development policy"".But we didn't even hear a word about it, and I think this is extremely embarrassing.For years we have been waiting for a report on consistency.It should have been presented in writing today, and after listening to the speech of Commissioner Nielson, I do not struggle to imagine that he clashes with a strong opposition within the commission.I know that the commissioner himself has decided and extremely rational opinions on the question of consistency, and I would have liked to hear them today.Since the common resolution proposal suggests a series of effective mechanisms aimed at guaranteeing consistency, in the short time I have, I would like to limit myself to mentioning another, that is, that the Commission should also start the evaluation of a new and relevant legislation in this area.In addition, I would like to focus on the catastrophic effect that common agricultural policy has on developing countries.You can download beef in Sahel and South Africa countries, tomato preserves in West Africa, milk powder in Jamaica, the examples are, we hope, all well known.And in any case they are all too well known to the producers affected in the ACP countries that must destroy their products, because they cannot compete with the products subsidized by the European Union.European taxpayers pay 40 billion euros per year to support EU agriculture.This money contributes to curbing the development of the agricultural sector in developing countries, where in agriculture 69% of total labor is concentrated against 1.7% of the European Union.It should be added that the agricultural sector contributes 34% to the gross national product of developing countries against 5.3% for the European Union.There is neither consistency nor decency.Why neither the council nor the Commission do they want to admit it?Mr. President, the way in which political decisions are reached is undoubtedly fundamental.Yesterday the United Kingdom Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister made statements on British government's policy regarding the voting system within the Council.They found that the United Kingdom, France and Germany currently far exceed the other countries of the European Union in terms of the population."	it
The first aspect concerns the fight against poverty, which seems to me to start to transform into a very embarrassing story for the union and for the Member States.Although both in the Treaty and in the UN conferences of Rio and Copenhagen we have made the commitment to eradicate poverty worldwide, in reality the balance of development cooperation is reduced, in contrast with the intentions declared.It is a trend that must be broken.First of all, it is necessary to proceed with the cancellation of the debt.It is necessary to move from words to deeds.I hope that we will be able to take on a guide role in this task.The second aspect concerns the fact that, in numerous situations, we say that ACP countries must learn the foundations of democracy.At paragraphs 2 and 3 of the resolution, in the framework of the new agreement, the working methods are developed and optimized, and that the ACP countries are encouraged to contribute to the debate with a plurality of political opinions.It is fine, I can only sign it.At the same time, however, we must ask ourselves how we ourselves manage democracy.How do things work within the delegation of the European Parliament at the ACP-EU Joint Assembly?In contrast to the way in which things go within parliament and his commissions, in which after all, the speakers are designated and therefore appointed, in the delegation at the joint assembly there are no rules.The two large groups spart up all the relationships, the general relationships etc.Just to change this non -democratic operating mode, the Verts/Ale group presented amendment no.6. In this amendment we ask that the appointment of speakers for all relationships, including work groups and general relations, is carried out on the basis of clear and democratic rules.In this regard, small groups must be taken into account and the appearance of representativeness.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, first of all, I would like to congratulate me in turn with the honorable Corrie for the quality of his relationship, which reflects with relevance the tenor of the discussions of the joint assembly whose covers he ensured very effectively.The elimination of poverty was at the center of our works and, to achieve this ambitious objective, many of the intervenes had drawn attention to the need to preserve an essential tool, i.e. the preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries, within the framework of the conventions of Lomé.The challenge was arduous.The globalization, the liberalization of trade, as well as the pre -eminence of the WOP and the world philosophy of which it constitutes the vehicle, endangered the very essence of dialogue between the north and south.It is therefore only possible to welcome the conclusion of the new partnership agreement for development and my part I am convinced that the works of the last joint assembly have exercised a decisive influence on the unlocking of the negotiations, such as the new climate created by Seattle's events.However, while rejoicing me with the renewal of the agreements, what attracts above all my attention is the new wind that blows now in our relationships and which manifests itself with the balanced character of the negotiation that turns to the end.	it
Then oil comes to the beaches, and then the politicians appear, the ministers and strive for disposal with a small bucket, but if a tough guideline is up for debate 14 days later, you have forgotten the good words from yesterday.We will not be able to rule out 100 % accidents, but we can make the provision as optimally as possible.This consistent guideline is an important step.I also hope that the liberal colleagues may consider it until tomorrow whether they cannot - for reasons of parliamentary identity - as in the first reading in the second reading, because we will then go to the mediation process anyway, and you have to see how far the advice can move.I believe that for environmental and competitive reasons as well as what was decided two months ago, in January, we should say goodbye tomorrow with a large majority, as we have debated them in the committee.President, Ms. Commissioner!Mr. rapporteur, my congratulations on your report.You have just said it: This guideline is urgently needed.It is a reasonable guideline.The ports need collecting facilities.Checks are finally carried out.Member States must also impose sanctions if the regulations are not complied with.This is extremely important and serves environmental protection.Investments are already being made in anticipation of the guideline.In Antwerp, for example, a large system is currently being built near my residential area, which has so far been missing.In a sense, the present directive is already effective.In a point that Mr. Jarzembowski also addressed, we disagree.How do you load the disposal costs to the ship?We agree on the principle, namely the cause of the polluter pays.Should the pollution automatically pay the port fees in full or make a significant contribution, or do we choose a flexible regulation, as proposed by the Council now,?Which solution offers the most effective economic incentive, as you said?I spoke to several people about that.The viewpoints differ, and obviously it is also very different in practice.Even between the ports and the same region, there are differences and apply different percentages.Some ports literally change their percentage at the last moment.We as a parliament should therefore not commit ourselves to a certain percentage.A flexible system, as you said, must include a significant contribution to the costs.0.01 % are really not a major contribution.Due to a flexible part that is kept open, those who behave environmentally friendly must be offered incentives.The prerequisite is that the commission carefully monitors and checked the whole thing whether the system works.If the goals of the guideline are not achieved, you should intervene at the Commission, take steps, suggest changes and make sure that the system actually applies.We definitely have to save this guideline, maintain and get it.Hopefully we will not endanger them by taking too fundamental attitude in a single point.President!It was not yet possible to believe that waste was completely disposed of when folding on the high seas when folded.	de
Especially in the past few months it has been talked about which position the development council can take in the field of Union policy.As is known, there is a clear difference between development policy and other political fields at the Union level - just think of the difficult conditions under which the EFE's recording or non -recording in the budget - and it is difficult to assume that we can achieve a greater coherence of the European Union's policies without a more active and stronger role in the advisory board for political decisionsArea of ​​development and which are felled in other councils, in other decision -making centers - whether in the councils for agriculture and fishing or in those for the environment - in which the development council has so far had no way of being heard or intervening.As a result, it will certainly be difficult without a more active role in the overall coordination of the political decisions, which are directly affected by the development policy of the European Union and are on the sidelines of its decision -making center, to realize a more coherent policy of the European Union in the field of development goals.Here, too, the word and considerations of the European Parliament will be relevant and welcome.At the beginning I would like to go into the successful conclusion of the negotiations between the EU and the AKP countries.Participation in these negotiations was an extremely positive experience.I saw how the Member States worked together as a team, and that was very gratifying.In the end, both sides were very satisfied, not only because the negotiations were completed, but because we were all aware that we had achieved something together, the EU and the 71 AKP countries.The world needs such experiences, and this is a very positive signal with regard to the discussion about the question of globalization.I would like to explain some of the most important innovations in the new agreement.Corruption is openly addressed, and for the first time we create a framework in which the problem of immigration can be treated.We promote participatory approaches, we ensure the consultation of civil society among reforms and politics that are to be funded by the EU.At the center of development policy, we are increasingly putting poverty control.The basis for assigning funds is not only the evaluation of the needs of a country, but also its politics.To promote the development of the private sector, we set up an investment facility.We rationalize the instruments and introduce a new system of dynamic program planning so that the community and the recipient countries can regularly attach corrections to the cooperation programs.We settle the administrative and, in some cases, the financial responsibilities at the local level are decentralized in order to enable more effective cooperation.We improve the political framework for commercial and investment development.We expand cooperation in all areas that are important for trade, including new areas such as work standards and the connection between the environment and trade.I am sure that against the background of the events in Seattle you will welcome the importance of these agreements.Let me go into some of the most important points.First, the agreement on political questions.	de
This is the meaning of an amendment that we have deposited, which favors all the languages ​​of the community and which will condition our agreement on the second directive.It is quite different from the first proposal.The original text could have received our assent insofar as it proceeded from a legitimate concern which was to update the existing legislation.The text text - and I salute the work of our colleague Schmidt - however, cannot have our agreement for several reasons.First, it favors far too much from indices that have no more relationship with the real economy, derivative products that will help increase the financial bubble of which our colleague Lipietz spoke at the moment.Second, like him, I think we don't have to promote excessive concentration in funds that would ultimately prove to be a Trojan horse for American pension funds.So, of course, no reciprocity is planned for European UCITS.We will also oppose the ability of the faculty left to the States to bring to 35 % ... (the president withdraws the floor to the speaker) Mr. President, this is a vital question for Europe.A Europe that lives with a time bomb ready to explode from an instant to the other, I have appointed pensions, must take all measures to encourage savings and maximize the yields that European citizens can obtain from their savings.I welcome Mr. Schmidt's report, which brings many interesting developments.UCITS are a success in the European Union.These are safe products marketed at the cross -border level.But it is time to update the legislation.Mr. Schmidt did an excellent job in this direction.I will not surprise anyone saying that I would have preferred by far that Mr. Schmidt's report has not undergone as many modifications during his visit to Parliament.But I urgently ask this assembly to adopt a balanced and good approach to this question.The radical advance of this report is to allow UCITS to invest in over -the -counter derivatives.I challenge anyone here to assess the products that will be used by UCITS.We are not talking about speculation, but of the means of reducing risks and increasing the yields of investments made by the ordinary European citizen.Mr. Schmidt deserves applause for having received the support of the Parliament in the issue of over -the -counter derivatives.We must not fear going from before, to react to changes in the market.Yes, we must continue to ensure that UCITS remain a balanced and safe product for consumers.The report protects consumers in a completely adequate way.But a series of amendments go too far in the restriction of the use of over -the -counter derivatives.I have the feeling that they will be an interesting complement to Sicav's wallets, and that they can only help everyone, everywhere in Europe, to obtain a high return from their savings.I salute Mr. Schmidt.Thank you Mr. Kuckelkorn.Dear colleagues, I want to give you the information I have just received about the curtain and the window.	fr
"Both countries are also entitled to financial aid from the Meda program (B7-4012).In the first and second reading on the budget 2000, the European Parliament emphasized that the new title ""Strategy to prepare the accession of the countries of Central and Eastern Europe"" (B7-0), which was proposed by the Commission in the preliminary draft of the budget plan, should not only refer to the associated states of Middle and Eastern European, but also extended to other third countries such as Malta and Cyprus.However, since the council refused to negotiate the necessary revision of the upper limit in section 7 (introductory) of the financial foresight, the parliament exceptionally accepted this - I expressly accept this - the financing of these expenses under rubric 4 (external policy areas) of the financial foresight in 2000. At the same time, the European Parliament ""Cooperation with the third -party countries""(B7-04).Within this chapter, two new articles were created for the approach strategy for Malta and Cyprus and given a ""P.M."" note until the Commission - in the implementation of the resolutions of Helsinki - presented the necessary legal bases and the revision of the upper limit of section 7 of the financial foresight has taken place.This proposal for a regulation should be one of these legal bases!- (en) I welcome Mr. Brok's report, in which the commission's proposals to prepare Cyprus and Malta are supported for EU membership with amendments.As part of this package, the two countries will be granted a total of around 15 million euros in the current year.However, it is regrettable that the Commission deals with several years of financing and instead decided to provide funds on an annual basis.This must inevitably affect Malta and Cyprus planning.Technical and financial support is given with the central equipment so that the two islands can take the necessary takeover of the ""Aquis"" of the community.In view of the status of these two countries, which has already been advanced compared to other candidates, it should not be difficult for them to be equipped for membership at the end of the five -year program ""technically and administratively"".Report Cederschiöld (A5-0020/2000) as a member of the Committee on Economic Affairs and Currency During the previous election period, I welcome the assumption of the present framework decision to increase the protection of our uniform currency.The Union must use all the funds available to it in order to be able to ensure efficient protection of the euro from fake.Consumers, the business people are not really familiar with the euro yet.Correct money can therefore be relatively easy to circulate in supermarkets, in exchange offices and in banks without this being noticed immediately.The fact that the coins will have a national side also makes their identification more difficult.The Euro-Info centers, which already perform an extremely important function for the uniform currency, must lead an increased campaign to draw the public at the risk of falsification of money.At another level, the cooperation between communal and national institutions is to be guaranteed and an information system that serves to collect and exchange data regarding money counterfeits is to be created.Criminal measures must also be taken so that the protection of the euro is secured from the first minute.In this context, the European Parliament has submitted the draft framework decision to reinforce criminal protection against falsification of money."	de
Hence, complementary measures are required, such as the obligation of judicial police officers to provide testimony, provided that it is desired, in any criminal trial in which their material is used.My group can not accept that the proposal of the Board of the Council broken the principle of proportionality.It is clear that the scope is not subject to restrictions.The agreement not only applies to the fight against serious crimes and organized crimes.It does not even appear anywhere that is limited to criminal law.Therefore, it is not inconceivable that the European Union ends up killing mosquitoes to guns and that the rights of citizens spbine into the smoke of gunpowder.Mr. President, the agreement regarding judicial assistance in criminal matters that we are examining today, contains the minimum indispensable for rapid and efficient cooperation between the different judicial or investigation bodies.It deals with notifications, the exchange of information, the temporary transfer of detainees, the restitution of goods, the declarations by videoconference, the research activities and the so -called Undercover, the telephone listening, and so on.It is the minimum on which an agreement could be reached and not to say that if some amendments are accepted, such as 32 or 81, the 71th reviewed or the 71 reviewed, the entire agreement will be reduced to the mere exchange of notifications or information and, in fact, it should be thrown into the paper, and we would vote against.I hope that the common sense of the deputies of the different groups will make them reject these amendments.In addition, the fact that it has not become a framework agreement and has remained in the field of agreements is a defeat for Parliament.As Commissioner Mr. Vitorino could verify following the different interventions, the need to elaborate a frame of common norms emerges, that is, of not continuing to advance in this way, with this dispersed order, with these small agreements that cover different sectors such as investigations or others.On the contrary, a minimum of safe rules is absolutely necessary, valid within the community, with an obvious increase in guarantees to the highest levels, precisely to protect themselves with expansion.I think of what this community would become, these agreements or judicial relations if, for example, a fascist country like Türkiye was incorporated into the European Union: I would be really perplexed.It is necessary to provide a corpus juris - everyone has said - and common norms, especially procedural, that guarantee a common rule of law throughout the community.It is obvious that this is a matter that corresponds to the Intergovernmental Conference and that it is an aspiration to which Parliament can contribute in a limited way, since everything depends on the Council and the Commission.I consider that this first semester, in which the commissioner is Portuguese and the presidency is exercised by Portugal, is an excellent occasion to give a first impulse to this common aspiration.	es
I also ask for the Commission, within the framework of the projects that have been presented, ensure that the Environmental Pilar of the European Union's policy is included in its projects and that, indeed, the objective of reduction for example of CO2 can be an added value pilot of projects that have been proposed.I think especially here in some infrastructure in the process of realization.We know that some member states doubt between the railroad or the road to open steps in fragile areas such as the Pyrenees - I am thinking of the Aspe Valley.But I also think of my region, that my Member State doubts between making a railway step and proposing a second highway, the A32.Therefore, here too, I will ask the commission to be especially attentive to produce a true cohesion between the different policies, and especially in the interreg programs that are presented.Mr. President, I have voted in favor of the Decourrière Report on the Interreg community initiative, especially for the response that Commissioner Mr. Barnier has given to some deputies who have intervened and have asked that this program remembered even more, if possible, the border regions whose limits are marked by the sea, and this not only because I have been born in Genoa, a city that is on the sea, but also because they are alsoborders of the regions bathed by the sea.These borders take us to the states of Africa and the East: we must take into account the fact that it is also important to develop the coastal regions of any part of Europe..(FR) as European deputy from a border region, I receive this third interreg initiative with great interest.The difficulties with which the border, terrestrial and maritime regions that have been economically, socially and culturally remotely removed have been remote enough.Due to the presence of borders, these have become peripheral areas of the states of which they are part, which has taken the national authorities too often, within the framework of national policy, to set aside these regions.Therefore, since 1990, the Interreg community initiative is instituted.The objective of this program sought to stimulate cross -border, transnational and interregional cooperation as well as a balanced development of community space, in order to strengthen economic and social cohesion in the Union.Interreg is essentially funding common actions in the development of SMEs, training and education, cultural exchanges, health problems, protection and improvement of the environment, energy networks, transport and telecommunications.I insist on the fact that interregional cooperation contributes to associating local and regional entities to the European integration process.It is necessary to promote a more active participation of local and regional powers regardless of community initiatives taking into account the fact that, often, local and regional entities have very limited cooperation capacities because of the diversity of legal frameworks and the disparity of development levels to one and another part of the same border.Within the framework of cross -border cooperation, it must be granted a growing importance to improve the exploitation conditions of small and medium -sized businesses.In the same sense, and given that 50 % of unemployment is attributable to structural unemployment, the means made available to Interreg must be sufficiently important to complete national measures aimed at favoring employment.	es
In light of these facts, does the Council intend to question the financing intended for the reconstruction of Kosovo, as required by the European Parliament?What other practical measures does it intend to adopt to end ethnic cleaning?Mr Parliamentary, I want to tell her that I have the utmost sympathy for the concern inherent in the question she raised.We truly share his concerns in the face of the threatening situation existing within Kosovo towards ethnic minorities, both as regards the Serbian and Roma population, and in the face of cases of discrimination, siege and intimidation that continue to occur in said territory.The Council has always highlighted the need to proceed with the judgment of all those who have perpetrated and continue to perpetrate these acts.In his conclusions of December, he also reiterated the need to fully apply the 12/99 resolution of the Security Council and has systematically supported the efforts carried out by Bernard Kouchner and aimed at implementing measures capable of guaranteeing in that territory an effective protection of minorities and, in particular, an effective application of the measures that allow to preserve the multiethnicity of the territory itself.In the contacts entertained with the most prominent political personalities among the Albanians of Kosovo, we pointed out - as the Portuguese Prime Minister recently did - that the persecutions of Serbian populations, of those of zigana ethnic groups and other ethnic groups are totally unacceptable.They will not be tolerated and will have to cease immediately.It has been communicated and reiterated explicitly to the managers of Kosovo that international support will largely depend on the treatment that will be reserved for non -Albanian minorities.This point seems to me of the utmost importance;The European Union will maintain the sense of conditionality inherent in this position and the same applies to the Council.We fully supported the efforts of the United Nations mission and the international security force in Kosovo aimed at avoiding new manifestations of violence against minorities and protecting threatened populations.The KFOR and the UNMIK police consider the suppression of all forms of mistreatment due to the ethnic origin as one of their primary tasks.In this context, the Council has congratulated its conclusions in December for the substantial contributions announced by the European Commission which, together with others of a similar nature offered by the Member States, will indirectly contribute to normalization of the situation.However, honorable parliamentary, the Council is also aware of the fact that the set of the means made available to the international structures responsible in Kosovo do not correspond, in terms of mobilization of the various Member States, as it would be desirable and this has limited the actual capacity for intervention on the field of the structures themselves.We will not stop, however, to focus all our attention on this problem, as the entire credibility of the Albanian authorities and structures in the area also depends on the ability of these same structures to prove that they are able to apply measures that guarantee multi -ethnicity within said territory.Thanks, Mr. President in office for the Council.	it
"We have to protect this kind of thing and denounce other practices.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, I heard this morning on French national waves, that the liberalization of La Poste would be practically only a matter of hours or days and that it was irremediable, like what happened to our Swedish, Dutch and German friends.This is very worried about and this is the reason why we asked for this debate today.The Commission has, in fact, engaged in a universal postal service, and the European Parliament has shown it several times, the postal service indeed constitutes, as certain colleagues have already said, an essential factor of social and territorial cohesion.In this regard, I would like to address our Swedish colleague in this regard to ask him what he thinks of the study that has been carried out and which shows that indeed, in more remote sectors of Sweden, postal service would be rather bad, in terms of distribution.So we don't want this postal service.The economic interest of the postal service has been recognized by the Amsterdam Treaty and we believe that it goes far beyond the distribution.It is the service that remains closest to citizens and that we call ""public service"", which allows each resident on European territory to be served and this achievement must remain a community acquired.The European Union recognition of a high quality postal service, and for everyone, remains of it today, and we are more and more concerned.This is why, today we are asking not to have unpleasant surprises on Monday in the regional policy, transport and tourism committee.We recall that the positions of the Parliament were clearly defined and that the group of Greens supported them.This resolution of January 14, 1999, asked that before any continuation of the liberalization of this key sector which still concerns 1.7 million employees, the Commission provides studies of the impact of this liberalization.However, we are not convinced that the available studies can today set up this liberalization, and we are worried because we know very well that this liberalization without impact study would lead to thousands of job cuts, which we absolutely do not want.We hold at our public service, to our universal service of postal services, because we know, and we are the representatives of citizens here too, that citizens are due to this service and the commission has committed, during the hearing of Mr. Bolkestein, to preserve this universal service in the European Union.I will not resume the different words he made during his hearing, I believe that we still have them in memory.We also maintain that we await this real evaluation before any final decision, as stipulated in the directive and the revision of the 1997 directive. We will not accept a date of liberalization of all postal activities until the Commission has given us the guarantee that the universal service will be integrated into this directive and that the postal public service will be maintained in the states which consider this service essential."	fr
The parliament always saw an important potential provider of employment opportunities in the social economy.The amendments mentioned coincide with the view represented by the parliament that the social exclusion is a serious problem that requires constructive measures.We hope that those who consider rejection of these amendments can give both the parliament and their work seeking citizens for their decision.In her report, Ms. Flautre also referred to an area that lacks coordination, although there is a need for considerable coordination.The Commission's proposals relate to the four pillars of the employment strategy and the five areas of the European Social Fund.However, the lack of concrete guidelines is all the more regrettable than the idea of ​​linking the ESF interventions with the employment strategy are implemented for the first time in the planning period 2000-2006.In any case, this failure gives the impression that the Commission does not know how comprehensive coordination between the ESF interventions that are subject to an exam after three and a half years and the annual national action plans for the employment of the Member States.We hope that the Commission can convince us that this is only an accident that is immediately corrected.President, Lord, ladies and gentlemen!The proposal submitted by the Commission in fulfilling its mandate is a reasonable starting point for the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.However, I would like to emphasize at this point that this starting point shows us the challenges before us: given the changes in the economic activities of all kinds as a result of the dwindling importance of the agricultural sector within the various sources of income in rural society.Together with the inadequacies in the infrastructure and in the service sector and a generally very sparse, strongly seasonal and less diversified employment offer, they strengthen the emigration from rural areas.The consequences are not a long time coming.It is the young people who migrate, those who find training and employment outside of rural areas, which has a very unfavorable effect in these regions.This lack of infrastructure is in turn an obstacle to the settlement of companies and the creation of jobs.One has to keep in mind that the rural area is almost four fifths of the European Union territory.Agriculture only provides 5.5 % of the Union's jobs.In addition, three quarters of our farmers are dependent on sideline farmers and additional sources of income.For this reason, it is one of the most important and far -reaching goals that we should face in the European Union, to make efforts to create new jobs in rural areas outside the agricultural sector, including in the areas of rural tourism, sport, culture, renovation of resources, changeover of companies, new technologies, services, etc.Only to prevent the economic and social decline of rural areas and the emergence of other ghost cities, but also because the farmers have a fundamental role in the management of the territory, the preservation of biodiversity and environmental protection.That is why we stand up for an agricultural policy and a rural development that is in line with our goals, as well as that rural areas on the threshold of the 21st century must be competitive and multifunctional, both with regard to the agricultural aspect and with regard to the opening for the variety of agricultural activities.	de
The problem concerns Danesi, or citizens of other states, residing outside the territory of Denmark.Question n.37, of the honorable (H-0791/99): subject: object: directive on working hours can let the Commission know what measures it intends to adopt to ensure a level of protection, equivalent to that provided by the 1993 directive on working hours, to the hospital doctors in training that are excluded from this directive and the relative proposal to modify the Council(Com (98) 0662-C4-0715/98-98/0318 (Syn))?There is a proposal for the directive aimed at modifying the directive as regards the working time of hospital doctors in training.The content of the proposal concerns the weekly working hours of doctors, on average equal to 48 hours, with the possibility of negotiating their extension to 54 hours.In this regard, there is an agreement between the Council, the Commission and the Parliament regarding the contents, while there is a dissent between the three institutions regarding the transition period necessary to implement the directive.Parliament's proposal hypothesizes a 4 -year term, that of the Commission of 7 and, finally, the proposal of the Council advocates a 13 -year transition period.This proposal is still the subject of discussions between the Council and Parliament according to the codecision procedure.Despite this dissent, it should be emphasized that instead there has been an agreement between the three institutions regarding the contents and that every effort is made so that such an important and delicate issue, which involves an exceptionally vast number of doctors in service throughout Europe, can receive a common solution.Question n.38, of the Honorable (H-0805/99): subject: measures to achieve the equality between men and women one of the groups of commissioners communicated by the president Prodi has as its objective the promotion of the measures to achieve equality between men and women (mainstream).What are the commissioners who form the group?How many times have you gathered so far?What are the concrete measures that have been discussed?The question focuses on distinct themes.Concerns the specific committee established by the Commission on Equal Opportunities.The commissioners who are members are the president Prodi, the vice -president Kinnock, the Mrs. Commissioner Reading and myself.The sessions of this committee are public and the first of these took place on 11 January 2000. In it three important topics were addressed in it: the first discussion held on the fifth program for women, in which I had the opportunity to illustrate a first analysis;the report of Commissioner Busquin on the research and participation of women in the world of research and sciences;and finally the intervention with which Commissioner Kinnock informed the commitment commission aimed at ensuring that the dimension of equality between the two sexes in the general reform process now taking place within the community is taken in due consideration.Thanks for your reply, Mrs. Commissioner.However, I must complain that that working group was so long to meet, despite the great importance of the theme had pushed us to trust that the new commission, from the beginning, would have placed itself at work in every area useful for the achievement of greater equality between men and women.I hope that in the future the situation can change and that the meetings of this working group are more frequent, because there are truly numerous issues such as to require intervention by the Commission, in order to facilitate and speed up the implementation, in the shortest possible time, of measures that guarantee greater equality between the two sexes.	it
After the events that led to the resignation of the previous commission, high expectations have been generated.Sometimes I have the impression that the proposals receive in this Parliament a better reception the more radical sound.On the other hand, the situation is not fixed from one day to another with a blur and new account, and the difficulties begin as soon as the time comes to the implementation of the measures, as soon as the details have to be talked about.This is possibly the explanation of why in the Budget Control Commission we had with this matter more difficulties than expected.Despite this, the results can be seen, now on the table, and I want to expressly thank the colleague Van Hulten their work in this report.If this report loses its consistency again by accepting amendments, we grant the Commission a clear and obvious advantage in several decisive points.Let me tell you the main advantages.We do not want financial controls to be suppressed.It must remain that the auditor examines resource assignments and payments before they become effective, although not in any case, when there is some uncertainty or risk.Therefore, the Commission issues wrong signals, for example, when the General Directorate of Financial Control changes, going on to call it General Directorate Audit.It is easy to change the organization chart, but it will be more complicated when the commission goes to the texts, in particular to the budget regulations.I have not told it exactly, but the budget procedure of the community and its development provisions speak in almost one hundred different places of the auditor, their independence and the tasks assigned to it.This cannot be ignored or eluded, nor with the so -called Soft Law as it was heard on one occasion at a meeting of our commission.Regardless of such considerations of legal order, it would be an unforgivable error, because of the nature of the matter, suppress financial control in a classical sense just at the moment when the competent persons in said matter of the Commission are no longer found alone, but are integrated into a chain of control and research mechanisms in operation.According to our forecasts, in the future three mechanisms will end up affecting reciprocally: the previous independent control of the auditor, the accompaniment and complementary controls of the review service still in the constitution phase, also called Audit Service, and, finally, the control of the new office to fight fraud, the OLAF, which will seek any sign of irregularity.It is positive that the Colega Van Hulten report establishes the connection between the three areas and that it shows where the main deficiencies are to be attached.I will only say as of asserting that disciplinary procedures are insufficient, particularly when it comes to asking accounts from deviated behaviors, also in financial matters.There is a large gray zone and many unclear points when it comes to imposing criminal sanctions, and precisely in this regard the announcements made by the commission are rather vague.	es
If there are these standards, who is responsible for ensuring compliance and what do they do to fulfill that responsibility?Mr. President, I would like to raise the issue of the statute of the attendees of the deputies who have always considered a priority and communicate that, as Italian members of the group and responding to the invitation of the President of the Group, Mr. Barón Crespo, we have sent to the Cuestors the contracts we have with our assistants.I think it is a specific gesture to try to solve this matter.Consequently, I would like to suggest to the presidency of the Parliament to reflect on the convenience that the presidency itself asks all the deputies to do the same.Mr. President, first, let me say that I am completely in favor of a statute of the attendees.Yesterday, when I arrived at Parliament, they gave me a document about a demonstration that had been convened by the attendees outside the Parliament building.As all colleagues will know - and many of you have addressed me during the last six months for this reason - all manifestations and acts of this nature pass, first of all, the filter of the Comart Commission of Parliament.As a non -controversial example, here in Parliament no commercial exposure is allowed for obvious reasons.Following the letter I received yesterday, I immediately communicated to the attendees who would propose the authorization of the celebration of a meeting or demonstration, probably in the near future and possibly next month.But all manifestations must be made so that they do not interfere with the good progress of Parliament's activities.Yesterday afternoon I signed a letter at the Meeting of the Parliament table in which attendees were informed about it.But as I have also been able to know, they were verbally informed of this decision by the group presidents committee last Thursday, so they were aware of the decision.We have nothing against the attendees telling us how they feel, nor do we have anything against them during the next partial period of Parliament sessions.But there has been a misunderstanding, since they received a letter from another person who made them think they had authorization.But all manifestations are studied first by the so -called Comart Commission.As you can see, we attend many demonstrations around Parliament, related to different countries or for other reasons.It is not about any attempt to censor or go against the authentic and justified principle that we should have a statute of the attendees.Thank you very much, Mrs. Banotti.It seems to me that your intervention can clarify many of the questions raised.Mr. President, wanted to point out an important question.Personally I consider scandalous that some deputies to this Parliament criticize the demonstrations, instead of seeking the solution to the problem, which goes through fair conditions, fair fees and a fair working time.	es
Mr. President, Commissioner, Ladies and Lords, after I have noted the Commission on the Community Initiative Interreg III and remember that I was at the level of the report on the report of Mr. Decourière at the level of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, it is not only my heart to underline our basic consent with the initiative in its current form,But also in particular in connection with Interreg III B to urge the recognition of activities by the Commission, which lead to a renewal of the landscapes damaged by agricultural prices and in which numerous associations and, above all, hunting associations participate with great commitment.I would also like to expressly support the comments of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism, especially what the disappointment about the non -recording of the regions in the extreme outer layer in the orientation A of the program and the regret in the face of inaccurate selection criteria for the implementation modalities of orientation III C and finally the question of the participation of the MPs in the work of the observation center for cross -border, transregional cooperation and inter -regional cooperationregards.Furthermore, I have great reservations about the tendency to be observed in the Commission to Interreg III and III B, to assign environmental protection exclusively to the development of Natura 2000.This often seems to me to be excluded or severely restricted as an abstract means of protecting the ecosystems, the users of which face danger.Finally, I would like to emphasize and appeal to the understanding of the Commission and the ministerial councils in advance that it would be appropriate to better inform the European representatives about the procedures associated with the implementation of the dossiers of Interreg and also from comparable initiatives.It would be even better to integrate them more strongly in the draft and implementation process of the relevant programs, otherwise they are difficult to perceive their role in the local authorities, the national authorities and even the guarantors.President!First of all, I would like to thank the rapporteur for the Equal report, Ms. Stenzel, to make this difficult matter understandable to all of us.Equal is an extremely complicated program because it is trying to put together various old programs and still assume a new approach, and were available with fewer means than with the forerunner funds.It's not that easy.Only the number of people reached by these programs has not really decreased.That is why it is difficult to find a balance, not only between the individual countries, between the individual sub -areas, but in particular also between the target groups listed in the program.And that is exactly what we have basically dealt with.Some said that one group had to get more than the other.I myself have primarily dealt with the position of the disabled and older people in the program, which I mean, I would have been forgotten occasionally if the European Parliament had not accepted it intensively.Although other groups are listed, the Member States in particular are in wait.A Member State I know, for example, wants to use a considerable part of the entire program for a single sub -area, namely for the refugees.	de
This project was long and complex.Also in the future it will be important to actively promote research regarding the use of renewable energy sources.Despite the validity of the new directive, some gaps must also be highlighted, such as the use of peat that must not be considered a fossil fuel.However, if it will not be possible to classify it as a renewable energy source, not fossil, a new ad hoc category will have to be created, taking into consideration above all the environmental tax.It is not right that the peat is assessed with the same parameters used, for example, for the fossil carbon.The development of renewable energy sources represents one of the tools that would allow the union to reduce dependence on imported ones.The research plays a leading role, especially in view of the next round of negotiations for the expansion of the EU.The dependence on imported energy sources affects some countries of Eastern Europe more, still strongly dependent on the model introduced during the Soviet era.The European Union must be able to respect Kyoto agreements.It is clear that we all worry about the environment and the future of our children: that's why the rational use of renewable energy sources must be promoted.However, we must remember that we cannot yet base our basic energy production on renewable sources.For this reason we need the nuclear energy that allows us to safeguard the atmosphere.Mr. President, on behalf of the Psepy Political Group I rejoice in the result obtained with the conciliation procedure on the Altener II program.First of all, however, I want to cordially thank the speaker, honorable Langen, who with this relationship has done an excellent job.I also thank colleague Provan, president of our delegation to the conciliation committee because, as already anticipated by the honorable Langen, this procedure has been a really difficult battle.The result of the conciliation also bears the imprint clearly impressed by the European Parliament.Mr Langen recalled that the Council resumed a series of content and requests from Parliament and that on the most controversial point, the financial endowment of the multi -year program for the promotion of renewable energy sources in the community, we have still managed to meet the advice almost halfway.I expressly reiterate that this does not satisfy us, but that we accepted the compromise because we thought it was essential that the program could be started very soon.In the next few years, in fact, we aim to double the share of renewable energy sources, bringing it at least 12 percent of total energy consumption.In the face of this declared objective of the European Union, the only EU program aimed at promoting only renewable energy sources, the Altener program, plays a truly decisive role.The new five -year program first intends to expand the initiatives of the Altener I program, including the intensification of the exchange of information and experiences among the operators of the sector of the sources of renewable energy, the consolidation of local and regional agencies for the energy already established, the creation of new agencies, as well as the promotion of existing networks.It is not a question of some examples.However, it seems to me that the Altener II program is particularly important because for the first time initiatives are expected to facilitate the penetration into the market by renewable energies and to implement, follow and control the community strategy and action plan.	it
This has nothing to do with the lack of commitment to improve human rights, but shows our usual efforts for the right strategy so that we can really achieve something.I would like to explain these efforts from the example of three controversial topics: the death penalty, Cuba and China.I will incorporate one or two personal views into my explanations, even if this may be unclear.We are currently examining the opportunity to present a decision on the death penalty in the Human Rights Commission.For me, this has always been a topic of great personal interest, and I have always spoken out against the death penalty.Inspired by Amnesty International and others, the abolition of the death penalty was one of my first official acts that I met as governor of Hong Kong.We know what happened recently at the UN General Assembly.We were forced to put our application to the death penalty to prevent the adoption of a resolution that contains completely unacceptable arguments and that would have led to the fact that human rights are not applied universally and are not valid everywhere.The stage in New York differs from that in Geneva.The topics of sovereignty and intervention for humanitarian reasons, which was discussed in New York last year, were so sensitive areas that all other topics were influenced.This had certainly also had an impact on the discussion about a moratorium for the death penalty.However, the focus of the debate in Geneva will primarily focus on human rights issues.Therefore, progress may be possible in Geneva.The second point is about Cuba.I would like to address this topic directly because we are wrongly criticized in Europe not to take the human rights violations there seriously enough.We are very concerned about the measures that the Cuban government took last year to circumcise the freedom of citizens.This includes, for example, changes in the Criminal Code and the expansion of the death penalty.We are also very concerned about the recent increase in political improvements.We pursue the human rights situation on the reports of the NROs and the work of our working group for human rights established in the EU messages in Havana.We regularly informed the Cuban authorities about the points we criticize, and this parliament also did this.However, I think it is wrong to isolate Cuba.We want a fair and open society in Cuba, a Cuba in which the principles of the market economy and the rule of law are respected and contracts are observed.We would like to promote the transition to democracy and strengthen respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.Many of these positions also apply to my third topic: China.I am, simple and simple, for making our position against China clear.Another attitude would not only be comfortable and nonsensical, it would be more offensive than a fifth of humanity.I hope that China is going to a peaceful development towards a free and pluralistic society in which people are not brought behind grids that are committed to democracy or belong to a religious community.So how should we proceed?In any case, we should drive intensive trade with China and hope that we can include China in the world trade organization under reasonable conditions.	de
"We agree on this point and I believe that the result we bring this evening, despite the lack of funding, will be used to largely relaunch this strategy and this opportunity for Europe which determines an economic and development factor: the culture therefore, the institutional and organizational component of a large community such as presupposes economic development, and not the opposite, as perhaps envisaged in the past, with a cultural habit.Man, culture have priority, and this culture can induce economic development.Let us observe this result, let us rejoice and award a certificate of great opening in the face of a useful strategy.Madam President, allow me, first of all, to thank Mr. Graça Moura for having managed to sneak into the texture of this fabric of conciliation.It seems to me that, starting the process of conciliation relating to Culture 2000, it is quite suitable that a poet guides us in our efforts.Once again, because these consultations are not entirely without difficulty, we must thank the vice-president, Mr. Imbeni, for his exemplary capacities to negotiate a complex aspect: to ensure that cultural expenditure is carried out with wisdom and that they are granted to us, within our community.The fundamental question, in my opinion, which arises in Parliament, the Commission and the Council is as follows: what is Europe?What does it mean and what does it bring us in addition to the parameters of our national borders?Europe is made of its citizens, its history and now of its community, but this is the reason why Culture 2000 is so important for us: I bet that when we ask the question ""what is Europe"", we answer with ""our art, our literature and our heritage"".This is what Culture 2000 represents. This program offers the possibility of maintaining a European identity in the 21st century, an identity that avoids echoes of division, war, poverty, opportunity, poverty in reality.More than that, and it is more prosaic, Madam President, it means that we are able to learn the lesson from previous political initiatives by putting them in new, horizontal programs and which benefit our creative industries insofar as they need it.He encourages mobility, and he opens the doors of culture to disadvantaged and excluded people at the social level.My only regret is that we did not have sufficient funding, in promoting this program, to reach our aspirations and guarantee our capacity for realization.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, here we are at the end of a long journey.After the conciliation stage, our institutions can now formally adopt the new ""Culture 2000"" framework program.We will thus have a tool completely able to develop, over the next five years, a clear, well structured action and, I am sure, fruitful, in favor of the cultural sector.It is with satisfaction that I salute here today this happy end and I thank you."	fr
We do that, the means and programs are there.I need - I have to tell you clearly - this financial regulation, which is available for decision here so that we can even start.The Finance Ordinance is the legal framework for the priorities provided for in the accession partnerships with Malta and Cyprus.I can't start anything as long as we don't have it because I lack the legal basis.If the defendant lack of coherence should have something to do with this point, I have to say that this regulation is only a legal framework and nothing more.You can find the completion of this legal framework in the priorities of the accession partnerships, which were decided last year by the Commission and Council and the now in the corresponding programming and in the management of the projects.On the contrary, I would say: There are many areas in European politics where you can complain about a lack of coherence.In this case, I would also like to claim for the Commission and the Council that we have developed a very clear, transparent and coherent policy.President, Mr. Council President!After the Lord commissioner explained to us in an extremely coherent way that the lack of coherence was the responsibility of the then President of the Council and his Minister of State, they might help us and the Lord Commissioner so that this decision can be taken here.A helpful solution would be if you answer my questions about the financial foresight by 2004 and the B7 heading or at least express that - like the Lord Commissioner in the Commission will try to get this - the Portuguese Presidency has the intention of compensating for the lack of coherence from back then.President!I think the question that the MP and my friend Elmar Brok has raised will be carefully checked by the council.I think the criticism practiced in the previous presidency is not appropriate.In my opinion, the previous presidency in the definition of the financial foresight did an excellent job, regardless of the people who were involved.In any case, this is an important question, and we will definitely support the commission's proposals in this regard at the council level.Herr Council President, I understood;The colleague Brok actually meant an earlier past presidency.President!I had asked Commissioner Verhogen a specific question about the financing instrument Meda, which he did not answer.I would like to ask him about it, because his answer also depends on the voting behavior of various amendments that are available to us.Dear Mr. Poos, I apologize.There was a ambiguity at the point where they asked me the question.So at Meda it is the case that Malta and Cyprus can participate in the national programs, not in the country -specific because the income is too high.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Verheugen!The pronunciation is closed.The vote takes place on Thursday.Question time (Council) According to the agenda, the question time follows (B5-0009/2000).We treat the inquiries to the council.	de
"However, according to the SCRS examination, the 6.4 kg regulation in the East Atlantic and in the Mediterranean was insufficiently enforced.The WWF reports that according to Italian, French and Spanish customs services, the illegal catch of red thun and the landing of young fishing increase.I can't and don't want to spread myself further.We are all under time pressure.Mr President, I would like to congratulate our rapporteur again, Mr. Gallagher.Thank you very much, Mr. Fischler.The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 11:00 a.m.Fishing and the environment: 2nd report on Bergen According to the agenda, the report (A5-0016/2000) by Mr. Varela Suanzes-Carpegna follows on behalf of the Committee for Fisheries on the second report of the Commission to the Council and the European Parliament on the ""implementation of the conclusions of the ministerial meeting via fishing and environment from March 13th and March 1997 in Bergen"" (KOM (KOM)-C5-0156/1999 - 1999/2150 (COS)).President, Mr. Fischler, ladies and men!The report I have to provide is about the important topic of the integration of the Binom's environmental fishing, which was dealt with at the Minister Meeting in Bergen.This integration has always been concerned with this integration, because we would do a bad service for fishing and the fishermen of tomorrow, we would not understand, emphasize the need to maintain the stocks, ultimately to put responsibility.Not to do this would not only for our fishermen and European citizens, but - even more seriously - for all of humanity today bread, but tomorrow mean hunger.The common fishing policy in this area is theoretically very demanding and strict, perhaps more than many people - many Europeans and many non -Europeans can imagine.For this reason, I asked the European Commission to publish a publication in which an inventory of all measures of common fishing policy is carried out for the preservation and protection of the stocks in order to use the spread of our protective measures.We also asked the GD4 of our parliament to develop a systematic study of these measures for which members of our fishing committee.The revision of the common fishing policy in 2002 is the largest challenge to make a comprehensive review, modernization - or update if you will - the common fishing policy as a whole.I insist on the whole and consequently also that the protection of fishing stocks in common fishing policy is taken into account.This lies the meaning of my demand to the European Commission and the services of our parliament.I do not believe that the condition of the sticks or the scandalous current system of the stubs are a good example of the quality of the system, which in my opinion therefore requires significant improvements.I cannot and do not want to spread it too much, we are all aware of the relentlessness of the clock and also the working hours of the interpreter.Therefore, I want to remind you that Bergen is a very important example of what the creation of a real marine policy must look like.As the acting council president at the announcement that the current Portuguese presidency wants to achieve that fishing is regarded as a policy aimed at the preservation of our sustainable resources, before our committee, this must be our goal in Europe and on the planet."	de
The same goes for amendment 2, which we would also consider acceptable for a small modification, the fundamental idea seems to us correct.Amendment 4 has the same characteristics a little.On this specific point, we could possibly give greater satisfaction to Mr. Bourlanges.We have already asked the Council to include in its decision a declaration of the Commission establishing this element of conditionality.What we propose precisely, concerning the second tranche is that we decide on the exact amount and the moment when the second tranche will be implemented, taking into account the external financial needs of Kosovo and the contribution of other bilateral donors.In other words, we do not impose conditionality, or we think it is more effective not to impose conditionality from the start, but we impose it during the possible granting of the second tranche.Thus we would not experience any problems to act immediately, we would not create any problems for the population of Kosovo, but, on the other hand, we would force other donors to fulfill their financial effort in the same way as we do.Ms. Dührkop raised a third problem in the field of multi -year programs.The projects are, as a reminder, multi -year.Programs must of course take into account annual budgetary contributions.Finally, I would like to make a remark on the wishes of additional information that you ask us.On the one hand, we were asked to provide Parliament with the evolution of tenders and in this regard, I can tell you that the Commission already had the opportunity, last week, to provide the Commission on the Budgets of Parliament, the last state of contracts and payments made since the Task Force was set up in Kosovo.The Commission may commit to continuing to regularly hold the informed Parliament of published calls for tenders.We also want them to also be published on the Internet, in order to ensure the greatest transparency on this specific point.A second point on which I would like to make a remark is the remaining information which can be important for Parliament with regard to the execution of macroeconomic assistance.On this subject, I also communicate to you that the Commission is willing to regularly inform the chairmen of the various interested parliamentary commissions, on a confidential basis, if the nature of the information provided, and on the various diagrams which are implemented for macroeconomic assistance operations.Thank you, Ladies and Gentlemen, Hoping that we can, with the final decision of the Council, unlock these funds and make a positive contribution allowing us to pursue the important effort that both are making to improve the coexistence and peace that we all want.Mr. President, I welcome the convergence of views that exists between Parliament, the Budget Commission in particular, and the Commission, and we ensure that, on our behalf, we will always be faithful to the appointment to help the Commission to assume its task.	fr
"These are some of the main reasons why we do not share the resolution proposal in question.The Labor of the European Parliament abstained from the final vote on the Leinen Dimitrakopoulous report.The text is too ambitious, and the British Laburists of the Peg believe that the intergovernmental conference must mainly deal with the questions still outstanding after Amsterdam, in order to prepare for the expansion, without exulating too much from these issues.Currently it is working hard to the reform, and for the moment this must remain a priority if you want to guarantee the consolidation and strengthening of Community institutions.An enlargement of the agenda and a drastic review of the treaties would entail a risk of destabilization.The key element of the text, as has been modified, is the request for a fundamental rights card to be accumulated to the treaties.In our opinion, this would represent a heavy legislative burden, while it would be preferable to have a written political declaration that illustrates to citizens what their rights are.Our priorities (the so-called ""left-over"") must be: the number and responsibilities of the commissioners the weighting of the votes in the Council the extension of the vote by qualified majority in some sectors, to the benefit of the United Kingdom and Europe (but excluding the modification of the treaties, the defense issues, the control of borders and taxation), with the consequent extension of the codecision where the vote is applied by majorityqualified.In addition to this, we believe that the proposal to introduce the concept of ""flexibility"" and to increase cooperation is not appropriate at the present time.The provisions of Amsterdam have not been verified enough, and to widen the possibility of not participating could weaken the European Union right now, when we talk about expansion and the candidate countries are asked to accept the single market and other European laws.In order to influence the European evolution, the European Parliament must take on a more constructive attitude towards the agenda of the intergovernmental conference with respect to the line that transpires from this resolution, excessively full of disappointment and defeatism towards the decision taken in Helsinki in December 1999delimited of aspects not included in Helsinki's decision, indicating the elements deemed most urgent to be treated, including the question of the public accusation for the crimes committed against the institutions of the Union and their financial interests.We Swedish Christianodemocrats are also contrary to the threat of delaying the expansion to the east if the area of ​​the intergovernmental conference was not extended substantially, well beyond how much the intergovernmental conference of Amsterdam has left unsolved in 1997. The most important task of the imminent intergovernmental conference will consist in the reform of the Union in view of its expansion to the new members.Therefore, I also believe that the Parliament now must give its formal green light to the start of the intergovernmental conference.However, I believe that this conference will have to limit themselves only to the indispensable aspects for the purpose of expansion.As for the rest, I refer to my declaration of vote of 18 November 1999, in which I clarify my position regarding the supranational character and common defense."	it
"The Commission would like the role played by the joint assembly to be more important, in particular with a view to promoting a larger political dialogue with our development partners.The Commission divides the opinion of the rapporteur according to which the fight against poverty must continue to constitute a priority objective of the development policy and it must continue to play a key role.However, to be able to develop, countries must be actively involved in the global economic system.In terms of trade with our development partners, the Commission is entirely willing to guarantee the fact that individual economic and social executives in ACP countries are taken into account during any new arrangement.Ms. Lucas said that Stabex and Sysmin systems should be continued.I do not believe it personally.These systems have proven to be inadequate, because they actually only benefit from a very small number of countries among the 71 countries concerned.These systems are too slow and it is therefore normal that the developing countries have said ""yes"" to the new system that will be used in the future, because it will be more flexible.With regard to the future membership of certain countries to the Lomé Convention, such as, for example, the East Timor, I can only repeat the remarks that I recently made before the European Parliament Development Commission, namely that the door was open to them.It is the responsibility of the candidate countries to decide themselves if they want to introduce themselves.We will then take up position towards them.With regard to Cuba's membership request to the Lomé Convention, the Commission noted that, on the basis of their recent declaration, the ACP states will support the request made by Cuba.The EU has always pleaded in favor of a constructive attitude towards Cuba - the common position of the EU demonstrates it - but it must be recognized that the discussions will be complicated.Regarding Côte d'Ivoire, I can announce that the 28 million euros have been reimbursed in their entirety, in accordance with the agreement concluded following the examination of financial irregularities noted.With regard to the financing of the European Development Fund through the budget, I will declare that this point is currently the subject of an examination.For its part, the Commission is favorable, but we cannot, at this stage, make new declarations as to the date from which it will be possible or on the way of getting there.Regarding article 366a, I will tell you that a new procedure was created, during negotiations relating to a new partnership agreement, for the examination of cases of human rights violations, democratic principles and the principle of the rule of law.As is already the case today, the Parliament will continue, after the adoption of the Amsterdam Treaty and on the basis of article 300, to be fully informed of all the decisions taken, and the Commission will continue to take into account the resolutions adopted by the Parliament on this subject.It is not planned, within the framework of such decisions, to follow the procedure of asking the Parliament to issue a concordant opinion.This would require a modification of the Amsterdam Treaty, which has just been signed."	fr
"However, precisely, all the communication of the Commission is built on the opposite premise, according to which it would be necessary, under the pretext of better defending peoples, always limiting their margin of autonomous choice by new regulations, new integrations of policy or new binding legal structures such as the so -called charter project, very wrongly, fundamental rights.I underline ""well wrongly"" since in fact, it will reduce these rights.To the Europe of Nations Group, our principles are very different.We want to defend the countries of Europe, but also to respect the choices of peoples.It is not at all the quadrature of the circle.We must indeed get out of the outdated federalist patterns, the patterns of those whose all the ideas, in European matters, come from the memories of Jean Monnet.On the contrary, it is necessary to open European institutions on the modern world by inventing a dynamic of variable geometry respecting nations.This is the big idea on the new governance that we would have liked to find in your communication, Mr. President, unfortunately, she was not there.Madam President, Mr. Chairman of the Commission, you pretend to give form to a new Europe but you lack, alas, an essential condition: confidence.We cannot, in fact, attract the confidence of millions of Europeans when we are not worthy.And how would you be trustworthy after the crazy cow affair, after the resignation of the Santer commission for corruption?You carry the responsibility of millions of unemployed and millions of poor, precariousness, and growing misery because of your ultra-swandling and ultra-liberal policies, because of forced march to the single currency.You wanted and organized the disappearance of the interior borders and you have thus delivered Europe to the explosion of crime and insecurity, to the surge of immigration without control.You propose today to give all the decision -making power to a handful of civil servants by making states, local communities and NGOs, all put on an equality foot in their submission to Brussels, simple performers from decisions from above.Not once, in your fourteen -page document, national parliaments are mentioned, however composed of elected officials of the people.But it is true that they have no role in your strategy.You do not even dare to call things by name and you take refuge behind a pseudo-crossed semantics to call ""governance"" which is nothing other than a federal, autocratic and centralized government.After having, for years, attempted to convince by speaking of shared sovereignty, you admit today your ultimate goal: to sell off all European sovereignty, whether it is national or collective, to a world government, in which you do not even hope to obtain a preponderant place.Finally, you dare to condemn and sanction, or allow to condemn and sanction, the free and democratic vote of millions of Austrians on the sole reason that the result does not proclaim you.And, at the same time, you support Communist China, you trade with countries that openly violate human rights for decades.Even today, European deputies go up to the niche against a telegram from Mr. Prodi to Chancellor Schüssel, who, however, obviously, is not a manifestation of sympathy, but a political fond."	fr
"Here we are in a field where the principle of subsidiarity is fully applied.Each Member State has the main duty to define their responsibilities towards minors.As regards the responsibility of the Union as such, I believe it is necessary that the rights of minors are recognized in the paper, taking into account the sectors in which the Union can bring an added value to the promotion of the social, economic and even civic situation, in the broader sense, of minors.I hope we will be able to cope with the challenge that the honorable deputy has launched to the commission and to the whole agreement.Mr. President, I had the honor of listening to the commissioner on this theme on several occasions and fully share his setting.However, I would like to formulate a slightly different question.We have just heard Commissioner Barnier say that it is anxious to improve communication with citizens and to set up the commission's information policy on the main issues that the community is dealing with this year.Would the commissioner be in favor of allocating part of the commission's budget intended for information to a campaign to raise awareness of citizens on the theme of citizens' card?It is very important that citizens feel part of this process.I know that the same agreement will do much on the subject, but does not have the resources of the Commission.Will the Commission take into consideration the possibility of using the budget for information to guarantee the participation of citizens in the debate?The political line of the Commission is to promote an open and enlarged dialogue on the Charter of Fundamental Rights, not only with non -governmental organizations, but also with citizens, on a project of as wide as paper.I can guarantee you that the commission do your best to launch a debate on the future card of fundamental rights.If we get to have a clear text, easy to read for citizens, and at the same time legally binding, we will take two pigeons with one bean: the two are not excluded each other.The challenge is to be able to guarantee them both in the definitive version of the paper.I am really happy to know that I will be able to count on your support.Question n.40, of the honorable (H-0095/00): object: articles 6.1, 7.1 and 7.2 of the Treaty on the European Union Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Treaty establishes that the Union is based on the principles of freedom, democracy and respect for the rights of man and fundamental freedoms.From the statements of the past years it is clear that Jörg Haider and his party (Freiheitliche Partii Österreichs - Fpö) do not respect human rights and fundamental freedoms in relation to third countries and minorities residing in Austria.Consequently, the Commission can let us know when it intends to propose, pursuant to article 7, paragraph 1, that the existence of a serious and persistent violation is contested by a Member State of the principles referred to in article 6, paragraph 1 ""and solicit the Council, which resolves by qualified majority, to suspend some of the rights deriving to Austria from the application of the Treaty, including the right to vote of the representative of the representative of thebreast to the advice?"	it
"This term also seems to have been deleted from the commission's vocabulary, while liberal and American references are in abundance.Romano Prodi picks up the very controversial ""governance"" concept, controversial because this gives the priority over the priority of the perfect functioning of democracy and because it refers to the term defined by the IMF, whose ideological content is completely shaped by liberalism and monetism.There is no mere semantic difference here.When reading the present document, the idea arises that it is only about the completion of the internal market and the goal of general deregulation and not about the realignment of European politics hoped for by our fellow citizens.Romano Prodi only speaks of ""mechanisms"", of ""structures"", but he does not describe any projects that are balanced and meet the wishes of our peoples.The expansion appears as an end in itself;However, if no social policy, no common values ​​and no institution to strengthen the cohesion and to further democratize the Union, the Europe left at the end of the Presidency Prodi could be a simple space of the common market within the framework of a general globalization and not the community of fate we hoped for.The leniency shown to Austria in no way to convey a message of congratulation - which is not forced to send him in any way - towards Austria, the royalty shown in any way.The European Union does not hold back to significantly announced its expansionist ambitions.The goal of the Commission for the coming five -year period is to become a ""player on the world stage"" who can play ""an original leadership role in the world"".The European Union has not changed.From the beginning, their actions were determined by a few dozen large corporations in the areas of economy and finance and their interest groups.However, the Prodi Commission now wants to change the European Union in order to raise a common leadership claim on the world stage with the United States with which it competes and rival at the same time.This new imperial policy includes a reform of the European and national institutions, strengthening state power, a stricter competition, a European army and the redistribution of funds.The fact that one still dares to speak of the defense of a ""European social model"" is a shameful lie, because the more the European Union opposes the United States, the more it becomes its faithful image.We vote against these goals because we combat such a policy in parliament and on the street.The elaboration of a European Charter of Fundamental rights would be the only small glimmer of hope in this policy, but again it is not intended to make this a matter of the peoples of Europe and to have it decided democratically about it.When voting on the resolution, we found the voice for the following reasons: First, the resolution does not show the indefinence of the priorities and obligations reproduced in the Commission's program.In addition, we believe that the main question with which the Commission must deal with the determination of the priorities for the next 5 years is related to its role in the context of interinstitutional relationships within the EU - and here both the program and the resolution are complete."	de
It is clear that we must convert the old methods of social spending into new economic and social opportunities.We have to get rid of the policies and methods that have condemned a generation of Europeans to be second category citizens on the world scene and to do so we must put Europe and its population in a position to fully develop their potential.If Lisbon manages to achieve these objectives that has been discussed today, it will constitute an important step forward to trigger the dynamics I refer to.Mr. Prime Minister, we too would like to believe with her, and with the Portuguese presidency, that the construction of Europe must be the construction of a civilization whose economic and social prosperity is based on the enhancement of knowledge, cultural diversity and cohesion, a civilization that plays an active role in promoting a more balanced, more peaceful and more solidarity world order.And we would also like to believe with her that there is a clear and general awareness of the fact that the extent of the predictable transformations regarding qualifications necessary to cope with the new technological challenges with which companies are measured by encloses, at the same time, the risk of new social exclusion processes, to mention once again his words.We would like to believe it, but we can't.Why?Because we know that the new economy certainly allows the emergence of new employment opportunities for creatives and computer scientists.The feverish agitation with which new investors always appear and with which the phenomenon of start-ups develop is under our eyes, but we are equally aware of the continuous rotation of staff at the telephone plants, due to the frightening working conditions prevailing in these new sanctuaries of Taylorism in which hundreds of thousands of employees are employed.We know that over half of the jobs created in the Union at present are precarious, provisional, part -time imposed rather than chosen and that, by virtue of this, they cannot guarantee those who deal with the conditions of personal autonomy - and often not even an income - such as to guarantee a decorous life.We know that new technologies itself do not generate democracy more, but only more individual and collective autonomy for socially better inserted citizens.We know that the privatization of public services jeopardizes social, territorial and regional cohesion, and we also know that the Commission proposes to accelerate it.We know that the unice, on behalf of the employers, announces the tone of preparatory documents for the European summit of companies, foreseen in Brussels in June: public authorities will be asked to remove any social, regulatory and fiscal obstacle to the development of the business world, but also to invest massively in the consolidation of the application.Finally, we know that those who boast of giving answers to the needs of citizens must first of all guarantee their full participation in the choices on public policies.All things we know.Yet we have not read or listened to anything from which it can be evinted that the recommendation formulated by the high -level experts will be taken into account, according to which the full economic success of the information society presupposes that it is fueled by the real needs of the citizen, rather than the only needs of the forces of the business of the technological sector.	it
Therefore, after the election victory of a certain party in a large country, you would give me an even more beautiful evening if you would say: We can agree to application No. 3 of the rapporteur!I would like to thank the rapporteur for his work on this extremely important topic and also express my thanks for the present proposal for the commissioner and the Commission.We welcome the fact that the Portuguese council has set itself the goal of doing something against the scandalous conditions with regard to road traffic safety in the European Union.I know that these numbers are known, but quickly still remembered: 43,000 citizens are killed in traffic accidents every year.So this means that practically every year a medium -sized city is wiped out.We welcome the initiative presented, because at least the attempt is made to ensure that commercial vehicles are as safe as possible and comply with the joint legal provisions.Commercial vehicle traffic on the European roads is constantly increasing, both with regard to the number and the size of the vehicles.In our view, there are three reasons why this proposal is so important.First of all, there is the security argument that has already been mentioned.The second argument that my colleague, Mr. Jarzembowski has already explained, is the fair competition and the need to create the same starting conditions everywhere in the community.The third are the positive environmental aspects, because this proposal makes it possible to use quieter and less environmentally harmful vehicles in the future.Rewage -like checks must be carried out everywhere in the EU.In my country, the United Kingdom, such a system is already practiced with very positive results.This proposal will inevitably have negative effects for the black sheep among the haulers, but the other street users, in particular the vast majority of truck drivers, vehicle owners and drivers who pay conscientiously pay attention to the quality, safety and compliance with the environmental standards, will benefit from this proposal.I welcome this initiative and hope it will be implemented as soon as possible.President, Ms. de Palacio!The amendment to the directive on annual technical monitoring of commercial vehicles is an urgent and important matter.The rapporteur ultimately came to a good conclusion.The commercial vehicles cover a lot of kilometers every year, and their condition can not only be checked efficiently by the annual inspections.Uncerted on the go are also necessary because it is often dilapidated by heavy commercial vehicles from third countries in the Union area, which is a serious security risk.The amendment to the directive aims to significantly increase traffic safety if the regulations can be complied with accordingly and sanctions can be imposed in the event of violations that are effective, targeted and daunting.The efficiency of the directive is increased if the member states can advise on the harmonization of sanctions.However, this must not delay the quick implementation of the directive.An argument for the rapid amendment to the guideline is a case that has recently happened in Finland.The police and surveillance authorities recently checked 62 heavy commercial vehicles during a control in the east of Finland, thirty of which were warned and sixteen with a warning.	de
"It marks the beginning of contractual stabilization of the countries of the former Yugoslavia.These are countries that do not yet come into account for a pre -market agreement.In fact, the present agreement is a kind of ""pre-reception"" but with a view to future membership.This union of countries by active treaties is an excellent instrument provided that the agreed provisions are resolutely respected and that we therefore reach the desired stabilization.Macedonia remains a potential powder maker and all its history testifies to this.However, she has the ambition to get rid of this reputation.To achieve this, it needs internal stability.The new government wants to tackle the question and the agreement can be a reform calendar, including a direct role and an equal position for the Albanian minority.The country above all needs calm now, to get the situation on a good order and find the way for greater prosperity.We, the social democrats, call the opposition to behave in accordance with these notions.They must also contribute to the Macedonian model so tuned here.But the country also and above all needs external stability.What good is the internal stability if the surroundings are unstable?This stability is necessary in relations with Yugoslavia, Kosovo, Albania and Bulgaria.The region must recognize that Macedonia exists and that it will continue to exist.External stability means open borders and regional cooperation.Minorities and majorities must have possibilities for cultural and human exchanges.The stability of Macedonia is closely linked to developments in neighboring countries.The Kosovo problem is known, the international community is present en masse.It seems that the Albania factor is underestimated.The Union considers that the moment has not yet come to sign a stability and association agreement with this country.But what does it take then?It is precisely the arguments put forward to conclude such an agreement with Macedonia and not with Albania that concerns us and make us say that an attitude of expectation of the Union towards Albania is not acceptable.What is the Commission for this consideration doing?Yugoslavia is also a weak link in terms of stability and therefore constitutes a threat to a stable Macedonia.We have to wait for the evolution of the situation.Belgrade's mood is becoming more and more unpredictable.However, we support the council's decision to give another inflection to the sanctions.Here is finally a serious attempt to support the opposition which is preparing for a new series of demonstrations.What will the union will undertake another in this sense if the requirement of the opposition - of the early elections - is accepted?What can we do more and what can we do more to support this opposition?Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the Kosovo affair marked, hopefully, the end of an era when peoples' law could be interpreted in a way that left dictators the leisure to persecute minorities in the most terrible way, as long as these persecutions took place ""within the nation""."	fr
The rapporteur pointed out to Parliament that the common position of the Council retains six of the ten amendments to the text presented by the Parliament at first reading, as well as the content of the other amendments of the Parliament.Consequently, my group will support the common position and hopes that the legislation will be quickly promulgated, which will provide us with one more tool in our struggle so that transport within the Union reaches the highest level of security possible.My group will also support any initiative to improve transport safety.We still have a lot to do on the matter, as shown in the news.Madam President, I would like to make some comments.I would first like to thank the rapporteur for his extremely precise technical work in this file and then the commission for the proposal she made.This is the harmonization of examination requirements, but also minimum requirements.In a way, it's a shame.The importance of safety on the road, on rails or on navigable waterways is naturally essential and due to the international nature of these modes of transport, we must also harmonize the training of security advisers, as well as, in particular, the requirements of the new ADR which should soon come into force.This is important but respect for these measures is just as much and there are naturally several reasons why we have to pay particular attention to it.Let’s examine road accidents in recent years.For example in Belgium, the Netherlands and in certain other countries in foggy time, with trucks carrying dangerous products, while under these conditions, they should have stayed on the side of the road.Or boatmen and their ships from Eastern Europe who moor their boats side by side, which makes the situations dangerous all the more obvious.In addition, a survey carried out in Belgian, Finnish and Japanese ports revealed that 50 percent of the containers with partially dangerous loading were not properly unloaded.In short, the subject is very important.If we examine the situation of security advisers, since January 1, in some countries, companies must have such an adviser.Respect for this principle poses important problems currently, especially for less important companies which cannot afford it financially.They will either get rid of their cargo, or they will mix it with other cargoes, which generates a series of problems.For this reason, these activities are asked to be developed in the form of annual reports, business analyzes and that they may be taken up in ISO 9002 certificates. The work is done, it is still a question of ensuring their respect.I allow myself to raise a last point.With regard to this respect, it is also necessary to conclude satisfactory agreements with the countries of Eastern Europe because it was not until July 1, 2001, in just over a year and a half, that they will join the conventions in force.	fr
"However, my experience is that these branches of production fix them quite well.Many times they have too much capital and are often consistently consent.I have seen computer companies that are treated with incredible condescension.I think that, on the contrary, resources should be used to try to prevent the disintegration of society, a division of society into two sectors: a new economy and an outdated.Integration mechanisms should be created.Perhaps the most important thing would be to create an infrastructure that gave the non -expansive branches of the economy and the population groups that are on the periphery.For this reason, I think it would be necessary to bet on computers in children's nurseries, by broadband wiring in the poorly populated areas, by technological public libraries and for not weakening the public sector.Mr. President, the agenda of the Lisbon Council, which will be held on March 23 and 24 of next March, gives vertigo.Only at the level of the titles of the chapters, we see the Europe of innovation and knowledge, structural reforms, competitiveness, the European social model, employment, social cohesion, macroeconomic policies and lasting growth and lasting growth mentioned.On that basis, it is not surprising that the multiple contributions of the Presidency of the Commission and of the Member States tend, for now, to disperse in all the directions that exercise can end in two very different ways: or allow a wide exchange of stimulating ideas, which each one will try to apply later in their country, eventually with common initiatives in the new field of electronic exchanges -and that hypothesis would notOr the Council insists on announcing results in terms of transfer of competition to Europe and we will go towards a larger centralization and bureaucracy, that is, the opposite of what would need.Reading the preparatory documents infuses us some fears in this regard.We learn that - have that jargon, but it is not mine - we must achieve a better convergence of the colony process in regard to the coordination of macroeconomic policies, the cardiff process related to structural reforms and the process of Luxembourg regarding the coordination of employment policies, while enriched the content of the pact for employment and multilateral monitoring of policiesBudget.But how to achieve a better convergence of all these processes so different?The conclusion of the presidency document dated January 12 gives us the key.It would be necessary to reform the great economic policy orientations, the GOP, which currently only have the annual recommendation statute of the Council to the Member States, to expand their field of application and above all, I quote: ""reinforce their character of"" frame ""document. Apparently the word"" frame ""must be understood here with its double sense of synthesis and obligation."	es
I think you have to congratulate yourself for it.But what arguments did the commission have, and specifically Commissioner Mrs. Monika Wulf-Mathies and the general director Mr. Eneko Landaburu, so that the Urban program did not exist?His argument was weight.The urban issue is so important that we cannot stick it and almost disseminate with a program that has very little budget.Today we have the program and, therefore, I think we have achieved something important, that sign of the identity of the European Union that is urban.But I wanted to lead Commissioner Mr. Barnier to support the argument of the commissioner and Mr. General Director, because I think they were very right.The urban dimension must be more deeply incorporated into all structural funds.The budgetary level that our cities need -where 80% of the European population resides and that are becoming a large part of the good and the bad that we have in Europe -, I think it claims precisely that this European dimension is taken into account and that this urban program is not the justification for not analyzing in depth, notcities through all European funds.Therefore, I estimate that it is unnecessary to review the number of factors that claim this investment in urban areas, factors that are the order of the day, and I want to convey to Mr. Commissioner that we expect their sensitivity in this direction.When hosting the intersectoral approach embodied in the new equal initiative it is crucial that the program triesMental healthDisabled organizations and non -disabled representatives of people with disabilities should really be interested in each stage of decision making.Therefore, this Parliament has proposed sections 10 and 15 of the Regulation, to ensure that Member States cannot neglect any of the groups to which this initiative is directed.People with disabilities have already been out of the list too often.Because people with disabilities do not form a homogeneous group, for example many deaf are considered a discriminated linguistic minority for having their own language and culture, it is necessaryof objective I. We have benefited from an extra incentive to resume the financing of community initiatives that has had an excellent response record.Among the old ADAPT projects are included from projects such as CORE, which has developed new supply chains for the automobile industry in Bedforshire, to projects aimed at improving the level of small companies in Hertfordshire, in Essex.	es
So far, the states calculated this GDP in accordance with the methodology of the ESVG 79. The last assessment that we have was sent in September 1999 and refers to the 1998 accounting year. If the present regulation is accepted, the first assessment of the deficit of the accounting year 1999 will be already carried out according to this new system.As is known, the Member States did their debt - if you can express it - they have calculated and created their national accounts in accordance with the ESVG 95 and have already published their corresponding assessments.In addition to the introduction of the new methodology, this requires the nominal review of the majority of the units and invoice processes, both because of the methodological changes mentioned and the better statistical information included in the estimates.Of course, these changes can change the public deficits within the framework of the overall economic invoice of the Member States.I would like to say briefly which the five areas in which the most important changes will occur.First, the adjustments in the delimitation of what is understood as an institutional sector of public administrations in accordance with the ESVG 95.This is important because the public deficit refers to what may achieve all public administrations.The lack of precise criteria for its definition would lead to deviations in the assessments of the public deficits of the Member States.Secondly, the public deficit - or, if necessary, the public surplus - the respective named needs balance or the financing ability of the Sector Public administrations of the ESVG 95. Third, the public investments correspond to the gross investment of the public administrations in accordance with the ESVG 95. Fourth, according to the ESVG 95, the public debt as wellor the resulting streams or interest.Fifth and recently, the aggregate, to which the public deficit refers to, is the gross domestic product at market prices in accordance with the definition of the system of economic overall economic calculations from 1995. In the end, this proposal of the Commission is a correct and concrete adjustment of the criteria specified in the system of 1995, which I consequently assume as a whole, as he haswas explained.President, Herr Commissioner, my dear ladies and gentlemen!Let me tell me at the beginning that my faction welcomes this proposal, because it makes the statistical basis for a economic and monetary union of harmonized, immediately comparable and more precise.We have already heard the different areas.It is crucial for me that from now on the statistical information is more reliable and more comparable.This is necessary because we have to be able to rely on one another: the various organs of the European Union and all Member States within the monetary union.Adjustment of the procedure is important for two reasons.First, for the internal market.Reliable and immediately comparable data and statistics are generally important for an exact presentation of the situation and development in an internal market.Second, for the economic and monetary union.The regulation from 93 on the application of the protocol must be reconciled with the methodology of the European system of overall economic invoice at national and regional level.	de
"Thus, today we witness a manifest consolidation of the essential nucleus of the ""Thatcheria"" orientations, although softened with care measures.And since not by the force of proclaimed conservative principles, with the argument of an alleged globalizing pragmatism and in the name of an endiosada competitiveness.Therefore, it is not enough with the call for the coordination of social policies or with the insistence on the society of innovation and knowledge or in information technologies, however important they may be.It is essential to abandon that monetarist and antisocial perspective and definitely place the human person in the vertex of priorities and policies.My group, which attributes particular importance to social issues, and taking into account the celebration of the next Extraordinary Council, met last week in Lisbon exactly with the aim of analyzing and discussing those problems.There we had the opportunity to debate and hear representatives of workers, Portuguese trade unionists and various parts of Europe and met, in particular, with representatives of ABB, Michelin and also with promoters of the marches for employment.And we draw conclusions consubstantiated at 14 points that we will officially communicate to the presidency of the Council.For us, it is essentially necessary to adopt macroeconomic political measures based on the revitalization of demand and public investments and respect for renewed public services, oriented to full employment and that guarantee a level of employment, in 2010, of the order of 75%.It is necessary to guarantee a more favorable income distribution of work, ensure taxesSmall and medium enterprises firmly bet on a renewed teaching system and for greater and better professional training, end the discrimination that women and young people are main victims.In the light of this and the ability to formulate concrete objectives and duly expressed in figures and with a calendar in that fulcral sphere we will analyze and judge the results of the Lisbon summit.Mr. President, the Summit of Lisbon will generate a new repertoire of good words.Words will be well received, however, the fundamental problem lies in the existence of an economic and monetary union that puts the fight against inflation to employment.The Central Bank has stated that the price increase should always be maintained below 2%, the stability pact says that the annual budget deficit should not exceed 1%.There is no requirement to place the unemployment rate below 5% or - even better - 2 or 1%.It is the price of money that should not rise, it is public spending that should not increase.It is possible that a country wishes to limit unemployment through public investments, however, such a thing is prohibited."	es
But who, in the end, will pay the costs?Regardless of the system that will decide to adopt, it will still be the consumer who pays off.To best pursue the objectives in the environmental field, we should entrust to producers both the task of collecting money, and that of scrapping and recycling used cars.The producers convinced the ladies Florenz and Lange to present amendments that significantly weaken the original proposals.Don't be fooled by car manufacturers!If you want this directive to have maximum effectiveness, use your vote to reject these amendments.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, this debate, contrary to what we might think, is not of a technical nature.It has become eminently political.Yesterday, we honored our institution with a political debate.Today, it would be a dishonor for us if 314 deputies yielded to the power of the lobby of certain car manufacturers.Asking consumers to take half of the cost of withdrawing out of use vehicles, as the amendment 38 establishes, while the common position provides that the totality of the withdrawal is borne by the manufacturer, for the first time Parliament would not present itself as a guarantor of the defense of consumers and European citizens, but would somehow become a lobby resonance case.We cannot accept it.It would be a precedent that would leave the door open to any type of pressure in many other fields.It would also be the first time that Parliament would attenuate a position of the Council, while in general, it seems to me, we above all move the reproaches to the positions of the Council.For example, the free collection system of old vehicles and the increase in the percentage of vehicles to be recycled will proportionate the recycling activities and the number of jobs in proportion.Therefore, for the consumer, for the environment, for the new jobs to be created in the recycling sector, the common position of the Council must not be amended which, in the current state, is fully acceptable.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, we all agree that we must think about the treatment to be reserved for out of use in Europe, but in this case the Council has not provided the example of a valid European policy in the field of environment.The German presidency behaved shamefully in facing this topic.First of all, the Minister of the Environment Triptin did not agree enough a common line with his government colleagues, subsequently the chancellor Schröder was mediated in this matter despite being devoid of any knowledge of the facts and moving with the same grace of an elephant in a porcelain shop.Even the decision adopted in June by the Finnish presidency was certainly not the best that could be obtained.There are some weak points: in my opinion, the main one concerns the fact that the condition of SMEs is not kept in sufficient, but the automotive industry does not consist exclusively of large companies.Precisely in the supplies sector, the SMEs play a very close -up role and we must also protect the interests of employed in these companies, as more than two million people are occupied in this sector.	it
"With the exception of the amendment 76, where I made a mistake, because I wanted to vote for my votes with the following fictional narrative: assumed draft an environmental directive: ""Directive of the European Parliament and the Council on the duty to keep a temperature of at least eighteen degrees Celsius in the streets, on the places and in the gardens of European cities"".The main lines of the guideline: a) Each city must equip itself with sufficient energetic and technological means so that this goal is achieved in 2012;b) The costs are fully passed on to all residents of the city as part of the electricity price.Opinion of a MP from Northern Europe: ""This guideline would be unfair, because the costs for a inhabitant of Stockholm would be two hundred times higher than the costs for a resident of Naples"".Opinion of a MP from southern Europe: ""Nevertheless, that is competitiveness and equality of the conditions"".(Fiction ends here.) The MP, who now explains his voting behavior, consider it positive that there is a community directive on the water, but it is of the opinion that Europe cannot be built up with environmental dogmatism, but that one falls into the caricature of legislation.Countries with flood and drought time, such as the Mediterranean countries, cannot be treated just like the countries with a northern precipitation regime.On the other hand, a Europe that makes the water transfers between different water catchment areas practically impossible in the future would be unsolidaric.It should be remembered again that we are working on a project of the political unification of the entire continent.Drinking, eating, washing yourself, ordering fields and much more: we need water for every action of our everyday life.This water is wrongly considered an unchangeable and inexhaustible resource, because such a simple process as opening a tap is apparently a matter of course.But this source threatens to dry up .... All scientific studies now come to the clear conclusion that the water will be the main challenge of the coming years, and this tomorrow.But it will be too late tomorrow.Today we have to clearly formulate the rules of the game before we all become losing.If the European Parliament passes the guideline on water policy today, on February 16, it affects its will to protect surface waters, the coastal waters, inland water and groundwater.Europe now has a framework that enables it to counteract the deterioration of water quality, to promote the sustainable use of the water, to protect the ecosystems, to contribute to the fight against floods and drought and to stop the introduction of dangerous substances.This is a lifeboy that we throw into the water.I am extremely satisfied with this ambitious proposal for a framework directive on water policy.The environmental disaster, which is currently haunted by the banks of the Danube, reminds us - if this was still necessary - from the fact that human negligence all too often leads to a endangerment of natural resources, such as water.The aim of this guideline proposal from 1997 is to put an end to the fragmentation that still characterizes the legal regulations in the area of ​​water and to better protect the surface, coastal and internal water as well as the groundwater.The proposal provides a framework that makes it possible to counteract further deterioration, to protect the ecosystems, to promote sustainable use of the water reserves, to contribute to the fight against floods and droughts and to gradually contain the initiation of dangerous substances."	de
It is precisely this diversity of the criminal policies that must be faced.Legislating well therefore means trying to elaborate real criteria of judicial convergence.It is also an opportunity to look in the face of the reality of the prisons of Europe, often overcrowded: these are places of non-dedict, unworthy of the idea that we do of ourselves.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, as you know, for a long time all our countries have abolished the death penalty.However, I assure you that, with almost a thousand suicides in prison in the year, they do not really have suppressed it.Mr President, undoubtedly judicial cooperation is fundamental for the Europe of the free market, but it must take place in a rigorous respect for those principles that are founding our civilization: the fundamental rights and freedoms of man, provided for by the European Convention on the safeguarding of human rights and fundamental freedoms.We can only thank the commissions of Parliament, who have profoundly modified in a guarantee sense - through the introduction of numerous amendments - a report that, as initially set, did not convince us at all.I turn to the honorable Schultz to reiterate that the amendments are always presented by us not by personal or personal facts but in the framework of a general political interest.If it is then a question of making a list of the inquisites, or seeking the inquisites, we could also find them among the speakers, including the author of the relationship on this convention.I therefore believe that honorable Schultz could have spared certain sorties.As I said, numerous amendments have been inserted that guarantee the rights to defense - I think here of the obligation of the request of the judge for interceptions - or the ban on the accumulation of investigative functions with the judicial ones as regards the common investigative teams.In short, Parliament wanted the agreement to only concern criminal matter;The limitation to freedom and fundamental rights provided in the agreement can only be limited to criminal matter.We need certain rules.Of course, the advice has moved in a decomposed way, changed the opinion during the work, is absent.Conversely, I thank Commissioner Vitore for his presence in the classroom during the debate.As I said, we need certain rules to have a fair trial in Europe - without invasion of interceptions, without illegal use of videoconferences - because in Europe they no longer have to repeat processes with magistrates who, instead of administering justice, make politics, so that the real culprits and not the innocent uncomfortable to someone are punished.Mr. President, the project of judicial assistance convention in criminal matters between EU Member States is about to be adopted by the Council.In many of many it was now time;In fact, according to the action plan designed to combat organized crime and adopted by the Council in April 1997, the work for the project of the MLA Convention should have ended by the end of 1997. It will still spend some time before the agreement enters into force, given that the ratification of the Member States is required.	it
I would also like to remember that our intention to establish an observatory is not new.This observatory already existed in the field of leader I and leader II.It has the sole purpose of keeping connections between the individual groups that participate in leaders active.The financing of the Observatory cannot exceed 2 percent of the leader.As for the possibility of financing projects that have the content of training and training activities, I point out that it is a point integrated in the new rural development policy and therefore it is no longer necessary, in our opinion, addressed in the leading framework.Within now on the merits of the report.In point 14 the Commission is invited to submit an evaluation report on Leader II as soon as possible to the European Parliament.In my opinion it does not make much sense to do so at this moment because, until the end of 2001, it is still possible to use leader II funds.We therefore consider it more appropriate to proceed with the evaluation of the program concluded.We will certainly do it and submit to Parliament a relationship on the matter.In point 18, Parliament proposes to collect a sort of compendium or guidance of positive actions made with leader I and II.I inform you that it already exists, has been completed by the Commission and I can have it to anyone of you is interested.In point 21 Parliament underlines that it is now necessary to approve the guidelines for leader+with due speed, so that the programs can be started.I fully agree with the request.As soon as the opinion is adopted here in Parliament, the guidelines for leader+ will be subjected to the Star Committee, so that the Member States can confirm the provisional approval granted on November 14th.I foresee that the Commission can therefore approve the definitive version of the guidelines in March/April.As soon as it is published in the Official Gazette, only a few months will remain, you are to be precise, to present the leading programs+.I think it is important to underline that the expenses in the leader+ framework can be financed since that moment, that is, when the commission's program is available.For the programs presented before April 30 of this year there is also the possibility of setting back retroactively on 1 January the deadline of the start of the admissibility to funding.Finally, in point 20, the resolution project reports, in practice, seven amendments to the guidelines.After examining them in depth, I confirm that the proposals made in points 2, 4, 5 and 7 are acceptable for the Commission and that they will be accepted.The proposal reported in point 6 can also be accepted, at least in part, as it is reiterated that the approval by the commission of the programs in the leader+ framework must take place within a maximum of five months.We believe that the modification indicated in point 1 must be considered superfluous since, following the consultations with the representatives of the Member States within the Star Committee, this point has already been reformulated, as desired by Parliament.Therefore, only the amendment reported in point 3 remains. The Commission can only share the request, given that it corresponds exactly to what it had initially proposed.	it
"However, allow us to also extract some conclusions.The electoral system that corresponds best to this model is the zipper, as applied voluntarily in Sweden.I would say where you can, voluntarily;And where is reluctant, by imposition.I hope that the best practices of these countries can also continue through Benchmarking in the fifth action program, Mrs. Minister and Mrs. Commission, since I think it is time for our parties to understand.Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate the curator and the president in the exercise of the Council for her complete interventions and, above all, for her proposals.As has been said that men do not participate in the debates that concern women's rights, I have planned to contribute to the opinion of a man, a contemporary politician and intellectual, Francis Fukuyama.In an article entitled ""if women rule the world"" defends the conviction that a greater participation of women in politics would lead to a world much less attached to violence.Athena may, the goddess of wisdom and war constitutes a woman's model for the ancients, but the feminine influence in our days can be an effective catalyst against war and for peace.There are, therefore, weight reasons, beyond justice among the sexes, which advise a fair and balanced distribution of public positions, as well as political and economic power, between men and women.The whole life of women is interwoven with the offering and protection of life and the environment, with dialogue, with reconciliation, with the understanding of views found, with the resolution of differences by peaceful means.These values ​​of women can constitute an alternative to the contemporary culture of violence and base a new political culture and a more just and prosperous society for all.Therefore, it is necessary that the Intergovernmental Conference introduce the principle of the balance between women and men in the composition of all the institutional bodies of the European Union, as well as in all democratic institutions and in the political instances of the decision of all the member countries of the Union.Mr. President, why should women enjoy their proportional part in the political decision -making process?And how should we achieve it?As for what they should and why we can quickly agree.It is a demand for simple justice and democracy and, therefore, a criterion of political legitimacy.However, when we have to answer the question of how, our opinions face are enough information, education and the establishment of practical requirements or we must apply preferred treatment, such as quotas in the electoral lists of political parties?Should the State, therefore, the Legislative Power, impose such measures on political parties?Or should we even think about a system that reserves 50% of the positions to women in the chosen organs?This debate that, in some parts of Europe, and also here, follows the cry of French war Parité, it is, in essence, the foundation of democracy itself and the political meaning that we want to grant the fact of being a woman."	es
"This is undoubtedly the result of a complex negotiation in which the two parties have made substantial concessions, which is true for the European Union, particularly in matters of good governance and trade.But it is above all the result of a strengthening of the ACP group, which was clearly a new soul after Seattle.I would like to emphasize that a new way of apprehending these questions seems to me to appear, especially in terms of trade.We must adopt an approach in this area.Finally, we must go further in the development support policies of developing countries.On the financial and budgetary levels, in terms of debt, support for sensitive sectors such as food and humanitarian security or education and health, as well as in the fields of the environment, investment or access to information and new technologies, as in the commercial field, simultaneously ensuring a perfect consistency of development policies with other community policies and also betweenimplemented by the Member States.We cannot content ourselves with continuously pursuing something that has proven to be insufficient and erroneous in the past.Mr. President, after listening to the Council and the Commission today, I absolutely must reread the agenda I have.It is normally a question of ""the coherence of the various policies of the Union with the development policy"".However, we have not heard the slightest word on this subject;I find it very painful.We have been waiting for a report on coherence for years.He should have been available in writing today, but after hearing Mr. Nielson's speech, I can imagine very easily that he must face very powerful antagonistic forces within the Commission.I am not aware that the commissioner has particularly clear and very thoughtful opinions in terms of consistency and I would have liked to hear them today.Insofar as the common resolution proposal proposes a number of effective mechanisms in order to guarantee consistency, I will limit myself, given the very short speaking time which has been given to me, to cite one, namely the fact that the Commission should also carry out an evaluation of the new legislation relevant in this area.I would notably like to emphasize the catastrophic consequences that the EU joint agricultural policy for developing countries.I believe that we all know examples: spills of beef in the Sahel and South Africa, tomato purees in West Africa, milk powder in Jamaica.These are things that the producers of ACP countries know at their fingertips - they who must destroy their own products in order to compete with subsidized EU products.The contribution of European taxpayers in order to support European agriculture annually amounts to 40 billion euros.This money helps to hinder the development of the agricultural sector in developing countries where agriculture represents 69 % of the total workforce against 1.7 % within the EU."	fr
"This does not mean that we sympathize with Haider.CSU MEPs do not have the slightest sympathy for Haider, the FPö chief.As politicians, we must rather ask ourselves why 27 % of the Austrian population voted for a party such as the FPö in the October 1999 elections. We must debate the reasons which president and try to fight the reasons which lead to such results.It is only by debating arguments and the policy of the FPö that we can avoid the radicalization of politics in Austria.On the other hand, the resolution of the European Parliament does not wonder about the foundations of the result of the Austrian ballot and does not advance any potential solution.For these reasons, the European CSU group opposes this resolution..""Because he knew what this joy in joy was unaware of, and that we can read in books, that the bacillus of the plague does not die or never disappears, that he can remain for decades asleep in furniture and linen, which he patiently waits in the rooms, the cellars, the trunks, the handkerchiefs and the paperasses, and that, perhaps, the day, the day and the day,would wake up his rats and send them to die in a happy city ""It is by these sentences that Albert Camus, after a long allegorical story describing the difficult fight of the inhabitants of Oran against the plague, reminds us, at the end of the Second World War, that the fight against Nazism,"" the brown plague ""as we called it, cannot include a final victory.That racial hatred, xenophobic violence, fear and refusal of difference, because they plunge their roots into what is most sordid in man, can re -emerge and dominate in any human group at any time.It is in this sense that the events we are witnessing in Austria must be considered tragic.For the first time since the Second World War, an openly pro-Nazi, racist and xenophobic party is at the gates of power in a European country.Faced with this threat, which carries in it the negation of the very idea which is to the curry of European construction, nothing should weigh: neither the legal arguments on what the treaty allows or not, nor the legitimate questions about the right of interference, nor the derisory respect for a formal democracy, and especially not the feeling of helplessness which seizes us before an event that we refuse all the force of our convictions.Elected from a French overseas department, the meeting, the land of interbreeding and mixing, whose population has been forged over the last three centuries by the successive contribution of Europeans, blacks from Africa or Madagascar, committed from India or Pakistan or Chinese, I have every day the deep truth of the word of Saint-Exupéry: ""If you differ from me, my brother,You get meshed!

"The objective of this regulation proposal is to create the first program of application of the preadite strategy for Cyprus and Malta, as of the year 2000 and for a period of five years (2000-2004).Therefore, the proposal aims to facilitate the legislative approach to the community ""collection"" and the correct application of said ""collection.""It is a new registered step within the framework of the Helsinki European Council last December.Thus, in this Council, in view of the progress made by Malta, it was decided to open bilateral conferences as of February 2000, that is, before the end of the month, in order to initiate negotiations on the conditions of adhesion to the European Union and about the necessary adaptations that must be carried out.Regarding Cyprus, although the Council confirmed ""that a political solution will facilitate the adhesion of Cyprus to the European Union"", ""this does not constitute, however, a previous condition regarding its decision on adhesion"", so I congratulate myself.Indeed, I have always considered the approach consisting of conditioning the beginning of negotiations with Cypring to the search for a solution of the situation that affects the third part of the territory of this Republic, occupied by Turkey.In general, it is true that the socioeconomic situation of these two countries is much more favorable than that of other candidate countries.However, these have been able to benefit from a technical and financial aid of the European Union for the transposition of the community ""collection.This technical and financial aid has been provided until the end of 1999, within the framework of the four financial protocols (B7-4011).Both countries are also beneficiaries of financial aid of the Meda program (B7-4012).In its first and second reading of the 2000 Budget, the European Parliament emphasizes that the new title ""Preadhesion"" (B7-0) proposed by the Commission in the budget of budget should not be limited to the associated countries of the central and eastern Europe, since it should also encompass Malta and Cyprus.However, given the advice of the Council to negotiate the necessary review of the maximum limit of rubric 7 (preadsion) of the financial perspectives, the European Parliament accepted, exceptionally - I emphasize this fact -, finance the corresponding expenses with charge to rubric 4 (external measures) of the financial perspectives for the year 2000. Simultaneously, the European parliament created a new chapter created a new chapter.to the ""preadhesion strategy in favor of Mediterranean countries"" (B7-04).Within this chapter, two new articles on the preadhesion strategy were created in favor of Malta and Cyprus, waiting for the present commission, in accordance with the European Council of Helsinki, the legal foundations and the review of the maximum limit of rubric 7 of the financial perspectives.This regulation proposal should constitute one of these legal foundations!.(In) I greet the report of Mr. Brok that reinforces with amendments the proposals of the commission aimed at preparing Cyprus and Malta for adherence to the European Union.The package will allocate about 15 million euros in total to both countries in this year.It should be regretted, however, that the Commission has avoided multinational financing and has decided in return to assign funds on an annual basis."	es
The melody that will be played will be a melody listened to by the citizens of Europe and they will want to hear the right one.As it was described this afternoon, it will contribute to a large extent to forget the unpleasant melodies that we had heard at the time of the European elections and in the past few months.The Treaty of Amsterdam and the Tampere Council develop the project of space of freedom, security and justice.There is one aspect, however, which is very important and in which this parliament must participate, I mean control.The legislation is so abundant - and I take this opportunity to congratulate the Portuguese presidency for its program which was presented to us last week - that we must have absolute certainty that it is closely followed, that deputies in the European Parliament, deputies of national parliaments and European citizens are aware of everything it implies.In addition, we must ensure that it is, in all its details, applicable, appropriate and useful to each of the different countries.I would like to draw attention to certain aspects of the resolutions that are submitted to us this afternoon, one or two of which have already been mentioned before.I congratulate myself on evolution towards the recognition of judicial systems between different countries and towards cropration in criminal matters.European citizens will not remain indifferent to it and they will rejoice.However, the Commission and the Council must know that many deputies in this assembly have reservations to be made, against the Eurodac system for example.We admit the predominant role of the council in this matter, but reservations exist and I am sure that the council will have CUR to listen to what the elected deputies present here have to say when the subject is deepened.Mr. Schulz said he was not sure of the definition to give to the word scoreboard.Any English or British, or whoever follows a cricket match, knows what a scoreboard is.The scoreboard, or display board, gives spectators the score of the match;He must follow the developments, he must be clear and clearly visible.I have no doubt that Commissioner Vitorino will make sure that it is so.I hope that at the end of the six months, music will always play and that citizens will always be attentive.Mr. President, allow me to welcome the President in office and his colleague from the Ministry of Justice, Mr. Costa.I would like to thank them for the welcome they reserved for my committee last week in Lisbon, and for the constructive meetings we had.Amsterdam and Tampere have given us a lot of work to do together, as shown in the excellent resolution project of Ms. Terrón today.I would like to raise three fairly short points.The first is that it is time that we have a thoughtful dialogue between the Council and the European Parliament.It has been just six months since the Amsterdam Treaty requires our two organizations to work hand in hand: we gauged ourselves, we had some no -imported beak, but it is now time to work actually together.	fr
"Since the adoption of Directive 86/611, the investment funds sector has continued to evolve, so the regulations in force need to be modernized.The new proposals pretend to guarantee the maximum level of investor protection, which is a sine qua non condition for the integration of markets following the introduction of the euro.Given that an average European family allocates its savings to investment funds, the proposals contain provisions regarding prudent management - I want to insist on it - a prudent management in terms of investment policy and risk diversification refers.Both proposals constitute a unitary whole.The first of them expands the number of instruments in which a ""collective investment agency in transferable values"" -OICVM- can invest.As already indicated in this session, the IACVs are one of the most important protagonists of the modern capital markets.Thanks to their presence, the number of non -professional investors who can participate in these markets has been increasing, without prejudice to the principle of distribution of risks and adequate supervision.Since the possibility of opting for diversified investment modalities is contemplated, private investors can benefit from all the advantages offered by new investment techniques.The second proposal expands the role that these important mediating agencies can perform in the capital markets of the European Union, as far as the development of the investment funds is concerned.From the moment there is the possibility of creating bouquets and performing certain cross -border services, these agencies can finally use the freedoms contemplated in the Treaty of Rome that have been denied during all these years.The Commission applauds many of the clarifications proposed by the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs and will adopt much of its ideas.More specifically, the Commission will adopt - and now I use the most recent numbering - the amendments 2, 3, 4, 6, 9, 13, 19 and 21 as far as the first proposal is concerned and the amendments 23, 28 and 32 as far as the second proposal is concerned, since it is clearly a clear clarifications and improvements.In addition, I value the ideas expressed in amendments 1, 10, 11, 14, 18 and 20, although they will be formulated in another way.I also agree with the underlying idea of ​​limiting the risk of counterpart to a maximum percentage that appears in the amendments 17, 36 and 45. In the same way I can accept the content of the second paragraph of the amendment 47. All the amendments that I just mentioned refer to the first proposal.As for the second proposal we can adopt the ideas expressed in the amendments 24, 25, 29, 30, 41 and parts of the amendment 27, since they include sensible suggestions, as long as their writing adapts.In other words, the Commission is willing to adopt their content, but proposes that its formulation be modified.In addition to this, I take notice from the request of the Commission for Economic and Monetary Affairs to prepare a full text coding once it is approved.This request is reflected in amendments 7 and 22 of the first and second proposal respectively."	es
By undertaking such innovation in our organization, I am sure that we can live up - or even overcome it - of success and the increase in motivation in the use of similar innovations in several administrations of the public and private sector in the last decade, approximately.I believe that the end of the centralized system will not have, of course, as a consequence of any effective financial control, but will increase its effectiveness and its relationship with operational tasks.The financial control will be absolutely guaranteed by the way we will introduce the changes and because we will introduce an independent and completely professional internal audit service.As I said before, our ambition is that money yields to the fullest without any reduction of security.We are also interested in the value for people who work with us.Changes in financial management and control will greatly increase the possibility of doing all that.I also appreciate - at the risk of being repetitive - to Mrs. Theato the constant attention you have paid to these issues and that has really done - if it allows me to express it this way - from the partier of many of the changes whose possible application we are examining.I hope I feel proud of the offspring that at least at least has engendered.In the first place, I am not sure that what I have heard from the interpreter's lips is correct, because it does not seem possible that an expert person as Mrs. Theato speaks of the abolition of independent financial control.Obviously, the financial regulation grants a certain degree of independence to the current auditor.However, given the mixture of financial management and control papers and audit in the current mandate, it is very difficult to consider it an inflexible role, however great the integrity of the person who occupies it.So that the changes we intend to make - in line, as I say, with the firm and clear recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts - are not negative in any way.Consistency, consistency and universal validity standards in a decentralized system of financial control are guaranteed by a series of measures.One is to achieve a training of the highest quality, another is to ensure that no general direction can assume powers in the field of financial control unless - and until the audit service is absolutely safe of the solidity of the system, another is the creation of a central financial service, as will see their lordships in the white paper, to ensure the establishment and supervision of said standards and also exists, for greater security, the precautionary approach of a serviceof effective and independent internal audit.I will not enter all the details in a answer to a parliamentary question of this type, but I am sure that, after examining it, Mrs. Theato can see it in the details of the White Paper, there are very solid guarantees.There will also be testimonies that we have taken into account the protests expressed in this assembly, in particular in the Budget Control Commission, which is important in relation to the use of Ex visas before in the general addresses.	es
Second, we must see what are the capacities of each country, so that this overall force of 60,000 soldiers can be distributed in an orderly and effective manner between the fifteen countries.Tertio, we must see what are the differences between the Headline Goal and what each country can bring.It is possible, ladies and gentlemen, that we do not have enough capacities in the fifteen countries and that the latter must all make an additional effort to deal with the needs that we have offered.How are we going to do?We want to do so by summoning a conference of the fifteen countries to see the differences between the objectives set and the means we have to achieve them and see how what we are missing is distributed between the fifteen countries that form the European Union.Ladies and Gentlemen, Madam President, we want to fix the calendar so that, during the French Presidency, in December 2000, we can close this process by a large conference generating forces of all countries so that needs and capacities are equivalent and that we can therefore sincerely say that we already have the plan of what we have to do from the end of 2000 to 2003decided that the capacities will be underway.Ladies and gentlemen, that is what we do, to which we are committed to.I believe that we have worked well in recent months, in recent weeks and I think that we will be able to work during what remains of the year 2000 during the Portuguese presidency - which really does extraordinary, magnificent work - and continue during the French presidency which, without any doubt, will continue to work with the same promptitude and the same capacity as that which it has shown on other occasions.I wanted to tell you that in the meantime, there will be at least four European advice, that of Lisbon, that of Feria and two European councils during the French presidency.During these councils, the heads of state and government are also ready to pursue the examination of these questions so that we do not reject the train and that we are able, by 2003, to deploy what we have agreed, if necessary.Consequently, Ladies and Gentlemen, Madam President, I think that in this area, we work with determination, energy and with the broad support of all governments and all heads of state and government.Ladies and gentlemen, I would still like to add two things.The European Union has the obligation to carry out all this operation by keeping contact with the third countries to which I have referred, countries which, although members of Europe from a geographic point of view, are not yet part of the European Union.These are countries with which we must work, which we must integrate because, if a crisis occurs, God keeps us, all the forces and all the countries will be more than welcome.Then we must be able to establish a fluid and transparent relationship with NATO.The operations that we will have to carry out in the future will be of three types: the first takes up the operations in which European forces participate in the context of NATO;The second takes up the operations in which European forces participate and which they direct, but using NATO's means and infrastructure;The third takes up the operations where Europeans will act alone.	fr
"Strongly concerned about the continuation of human rights violations in Tibet and in order to support the proposal of the Dalai Lama aimed at establishing a dialogue with the Chinese government in order to resolve the Tibetan situation, the inter-group working group ""Tibet"" therefore asks the commission to appoint a delegate for Tibetan affairs, who will take care of the European Union,will strive to bring the Tibetan, Chinese authorities or their representatives to start a dialogue.When does the commission intend to name this Tibetan affairs delegate?The floor is to Mr. Patten, on behalf of the Commission.The concerns expressed by the European Parliament about Tibet are widely shared.I have long believed in the need to clearly and sincerely expose our points of view on human rights, including in Tibet, to the Chinese authorities.This is what the European Union did last month, at the European Union-China summit in Beijing, during which we have exerted pressures with the Chinese on a series of questions relating to human rights, including in Tibet.Once again, we invited the Chinese to start a dialogue with the Dalai Lama.Once again, I invite the Chinese to do so.We will continue to raise the question of Tibet with the Chinese authorities.We also undertake other actions: during the dialogue between the European Union and China on Human rights, we focused on a series of practical measures, including the sending of mission experts to Tibet, planning development assistance programs and activities relating to health, education and training for Tibetans.It is to the council that the appointment of an EU special envoy would mainly return to Tibet and the European Parliament could tackle the issue directly with him.As far as I'm concerned, I am not sure that our efforts would gain a lot from a practical point of view.It is unlikely that it will have a great impact on the Chinese authorities and we already have effective communication channels with the Tibetan community in exile.I would also like to avoid an exponential growth in the number of special envoys, whatever commendable.Mr. President, Mr. Patten, of course you benefit from an excellent experience of China because of your journey and you most certainly know how the Tibetans are trying to obtain the implementation of dialogues, which have all been avoided so far.If your answer is limited to telling us to send us to Mr. PESC, to Mr. Solana, I fear that it is a unilateral orientation in terms of foreign policy.Your approach, which I gladly recommend for its consistency, is inspired by the theme of human rights.I totally agree: we must take care of the theme of human rights.Detention, torture, mutilation of young women and other similar practices are all themes of discussion quite endless.If we reduce all this to say that the Council is competent in these matters, I fear that the questions relating to human rights do not come enough in the foreground.The possibility of insisting on the one hand on the economy and trade while including the issue of human rights would be a measure for which we would actually be able to tell the partnership of the European Commission and would not say that this is the case of the Council."	fr
Therefore, I support Mr. Swoboda's well -founded report - we are not used to anything else - and therefore also my appreciative words about the respectable Republic of Macedonia.Mr. President, revered colleagues, allow me to pronounce my personal recognition for the quality of his work, the rapporteur, Mr. Swoboda.Today we make an advisable statement on the initiation of negotiations on a stabilization and association agreement between the European Union and the Republic of Macedonia.We do this in the consciousness that this decision, the first ever that refers to this region, is specified in a completely new phase of our relationships with the Balkans.He himself is a factor of this new phase or a policy that sees the only way to solve your conflicts in the future integration of this region into the European Union.Our approval of the negotiations, as proposed in the justification of the rapporteur, is based on our conviction that it is correct to combine both a regional dimension in the Union politics and the specific appreciation of the efforts and results of the individual member states in the alignment with each other.In my opinion, this double objective must be pursued.Therefore, on the one hand, the programs related to the infrastructures, for example, must be prepared for the creation of a free trade zone - for which it is still too early - and forms of economic and commercial cooperation between the Balkan countries, and on the other hand, it is time to create a model for a narrower integration policy with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.For various reasons, we cannot avoid a positive statement.As we found in the framework of our missions in Skopje, in the former Republic of Yugoslavia, the progress in the economic sector, on the way to democracy and on the - in the Balkans region - quite difficult and conflicting - area of ​​living together between different ethnic groups are remarkable;On the other hand, a high price was paid for the war in neighboring Kosovo, both by providing logistics for the NATO forces and the falling exports to Northern Europe.In conclusion, I would like to emphasize that these developments are undoubtedly difficult, inconsistent and insecure and that we demand constant vigilance in relation to the various stages that must be expressed through regular and targeted checks.President, Mr. Commissioner, revered colleagues!At this point I would like to express that negotiations with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia are welcomed by the faction of the liberals, the Democrats and the reformers of Europe.I have the strong hope that this agreement may serve as an example in its basic features in his rapporteur, Mr. Swoboda, and as soon as possible to other countries, especially in Albania, Bosnia-Herzegovina, Croatia, Montenegro, Kosovo, and as soon as possible is also extended to Serbia.According to our conviction, a rapid introduction to these negotiations and their rapid conclusion are the only way to create peace in the region - those peace that has not automatically occurred since the end of the war in Kosovo - and thus prevent conditions for further decay again and that chaos and violence will be used again, which leads to instability in Europe, if not in the world.	de
That the public accepts such prices without abandoning financial operations in panic can be explained by the too optimistic expectation of future profits.Speculative activities develop beyond any measure and in turn feed profits which, one day, will prove to be fictitious.Excessive optimism will succeed disenchantment and fear, with the consequence of a stock market crisis and, possibly, an economic crisis.The risk is too large for you to ignore it.We have to face it, even if it seems difficult.Modern economic science has given us a remarkable tool with the proposal of Tobin and others that we could use if we had the political will to start acting.This is what we miss, Mr. Commissioner, the political will to start attacking speculation.But the blissful admiration or resignation in the face of market forces, the professions of faith of the Liberals - and I regret that Mr. Gasòliba I Böhm no longer sits among us - cannot continue indefinitely to characterize democracy, because they lead us straight for the disaster!Madam President, Mr. Bolkestein, it is quite incredible to see how ignorance permeates this discussion.It was necessary for a Greek colleague to tell us what this Tobin tax meant.You refuse it without any other form of trial because you do not understand anything.It is perfectly clear that the right is opposed to taxes;Otherwise, it would never have dared to transfer these millions, even these billions, to Switzerland.It has become clear.Now, I am calling you - with full knowledge of the facts - to help stop speculative financial capital, to finally support long -term projects by long -term capital.This has never been done in Southeast Asia, it has never been done in Europe and, to consider their financial management, I can understand that our Austrian Karas colleague is no longer there.It's the same mess.We need a Tobin tax to be able to intervene via a tax instrument.Madam President, I am revolted with the political ignorance of this commission, that is to say Commissioner Bolkestein.Given his position on the Tobin tax, he should really wonder why he is here.Madam President, I too had the impression of a ghostly debate somewhat.It is undoubtedly no coincidence that no preservatives be present because the idea of ​​market freedom they defended has nothing to do with the august principles of the social market economy which have brought so much prosperity to Western Europe in recent decades.If we continue to assert the sacrosanct nature of the markets - such is the ideology - and even to maintain that any intervention in the functioning of these markets is opposed to the progress and the growth of the economy, we most certainly be wrong and this can take very dangerous proportions.Currently, capital holders still have colossal fortunes that are asking to be reinvested.	fr
"I condemn the false arguments that, since both sides, it has been tried to deceive the deputies and public opinion in the context of this difficult and partly technical theme.That is why I especially appreciate the intervention of the colleagues in my group that contributed to make some commitments possible.Above all, I want to especially thank the enormous work that our rapporteur has done, Mrs. Lienemann, and her cooperative attitude, even when discrepancies still subsist in relation to some points.I also want to express, on the other hand, my thanks to the representatives of the European Commission, who have always been available to advise us and offer us technical help.If the representatives of the Council of Ministers adopt the same constructive attitude, I have no doubt that in the conciliation procedure we will achieve an even more appropriate solution for the protection of the aquatic environment in Europe.Mr. President, first of all I want to congratulate Mrs. Lienemann for the excellent work she has presented and for the effort she has made when approaching the differences that separate us in the issue of water.The Water Framework Directive is a necessary initiative.However, and based on the fact that the idea of ​​solidarity is intrinsic to the European construction process, this directive must be taken into account that water resources must be understood as a social cohesion factor.Water -Nadie doubts- is a good of general interest.However, in the case of Spain and other southern countries, which present an irregular weather, the management of water resources requires political approaches to rationalize its use and other solidarity measures.Therefore, we consider that this Framework Directive must advocate a use of water that allows to overcome territorial imbalances and, for this purpose, I request its support for the amendment 95, which our group has presented.We want to ensure that in article 1 of the Directive a sustainable, efficient, fair and solidarity of water is promoted.I will now make a brief review of the main issues in which the Spanish socialist delegation maintains some divergence with respect to certain positions that are defended here.This is the case of the transfers.It would seem better than the future Framework Directive, it would not be subject to community supervision the possibility of carrying them out.We consider that, given the hydrographic characteristics of the Spanish State, where transves of structural nature are carried out, it must be the authorities of the country that decide on the resources of their own territory, a decision that, of course, should always be taken from the criteria of the search for cohesion and the rational use of water.With regard to one of the most controversial points of our debate, that of the tarification, the Spanish socialists have been defending that, since respecting the principle of ""who pollutes pays"", the directive advocates accessible price policies for all levels of consumption.It is evident that in Spain a full recovery policy of water costs would not have the same impact as in the countries of the center and northern Europe.The Spaniards would see the price of water increased for their various uses due, precisely, to the shortage of water resources and the internalization of environmental costs that will be necessary to carry out within the framework of the provisions of the Directive."	es
I spoke of the extraordinary European Council and the intention to make it expressed by Portugal;I talked about it with a future perspective, as there are two complementary ways of dealing with the question of social exclusion: one of them is represented by the set of measures to be adopted in the immediate time in order to combat its concrete effects, the second is represented by the creation of conditions of competitiveness internationally that allow us to improve the economic fabric within the Union with positive consequences on the problems of social exclusion.However, the Portuguese presidency does not have miraculous recipes to answer in six months to issues that have always lasted.There is the willingness to operate in these areas, on the proposal of the Commission, in all areas of community competence and of course it is possible - and it is our interest - to encourage together the initiatives that will be presented, in particular, by non -governmental organizations, but also thanks to the traditional intergovernmental coordination in these sectors.However, it must be kept in mind, honorable parliamentary, that it is not possible to operate in an area of ​​such great impact, from a financial point of view, only and only through measures proposed by a presidency in charge for only six months.For this reason, we believe that only the measures envisaged in the context of long -term strategies - although knowing, is true, that in the long run some homeless people may be dead - they will allow us to launch sustainable policies at the European Union level.And it is to these strategies that we will try to contribute in the best possible way during our semester.Question n.12, of the Honorable (H-0801/99): subject: the Portuguese Presidency and Development Policy intends to the President in office to make a declaration on the priorities of the Portuguese Presidency as regards the development policy, the Lomé Convention and the way to face the situations of famine?I would like to thank the presidency for the comprehensive answer provided to my question, and in particular the minister who spoke at the commission for development last week in Brussels illustrating the matter.However, there are still some problems to solve.No accent has been placed in the program on the fight against AIDS.The situation of AIDS in Africa has now become serious to the point that more people die due to this disease than in conflicts.I hope the minister dedicate some time to this particular issue.In the United States, drugs are available, but the price applied does not make them accessible to African peoples.I would like to ask the minister what he is doing exactly about the situation that is developing in Ethiopia where there is drought, the crops have not been successful and where in six months we will inevitably return to the situation that existed a few years ago, characterized by the famine and the death of thousands of people.At the same time, a war between Eritrea and Ethiopia is underway and the European armaments industry sends its weapons, after which we will send the bread.Mr Parliamentary, first of all I would like it to be clear that I disagree with the interpretation you have given to the intervention of my colleague during the meeting of the Commission for Development and Cooperation.	it
"The duration of the regulation: In order to avoid a placement procedure, the Commission rejects change application 12 and the proposal of an unlimited validity of the regulations.In our view, the seven -year period of validity proposed by the Council is an acceptable compromise.Bank guarantees: For the reasons already mentioned, the Commission rejects change application 8 in relation to bank guarantees.We reject special provisions in certain household lines because this contradicts our common goal of simplifying and standardizing our administrative procedures.In addition, due to a decision that was made by the Commission in 1999, we are of the opinion that this topic has been essentially clarified.As far as the other amendments are concerned, we represent the following position: The Commission welcomes and supports the amendments 7 and 10.We reject change applications 2, 3 and 6 because we believe that the underlying concepts have already been taken into account in the regulation after the first reading in other places.In the interest of a clear and concise legal regulation, we should refrain from these amendments.Change application 1 is not supported because, in our view, hardly anything is added.In view of the negative opinion of the Council on this amendment, the Commission also speaks for its deletion.Finally, we reject amendment 5 because we consider the wording ""serious doubts"" to be too subjective and fear that this could make the implementation of the regulation very difficult.In addition, the aim of this amendment, namely the avoidance of projects with negative social, cultural or economic effects as well as negative consequences for the environment is already taken into account in Article 4 paragraph 5 of compatibility tests.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner Nielson!The pronunciation is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 p.m.Ship waste and load residues Now, colleague Jarzembowski, follows the great moment!According to the agenda, the recommendation for the second reading (A5-0043/2000) by Mr. Bouwman follows on behalf of the Committee on Regional Policy, Transport and Tourism on the joint position of the Council with regard to the enactment of the directive of the European Parliament and the Council on Hafenfägfängerungs for ship waste and load residues.President, Ms. Commissioner!Today we treat a guideline that is necessary, even bitter.In the past few weeks we have talked about Erika's accident.It was also about suggestions for various new, short -term measures such as double -walled fuselage, controls, monitoring of inspection organs and so on.The oil pollution of the sea caused by such disasters is about 3 %.A percentage of twice as high is due to normal ship operations.But that's not all.In the Netherlands, for example, but also in other countries, 49 % of the unrest are washed off directly from the sea on our beaches.The tourists only have 15 %, while a large part of even unknown and not precisely localized origin is.In view of the enormous economic damage, in view of the qualitative impairment of the habitats very important for seabirds, fish and other living beings, in short, since it is about our environment, the present directive is an urgent need. I need nothing to say about the reasons for this guideline."	de
In addition, there is a lack of transparency.Everything is done to let the chain of responsibilities, the identity of the owners and the true decision -makers in the dark as far as possible.This is no longer acceptable.In all of these areas, we have to achieve real and significant changes, including the determination of a key date for the new standards, which also includes the double outer skin, otherwise there is a ban on entering in the ports or a driving ban in the territorial waters of the Member States.In addition, we have to ensure that rigoroser is carried out at the exhibition of sea level tests and in the monitoring of the condition and the maintenance of the ships.Finally, it must be ensured that in the event of a catastrophe, all responsible persons are used for compensation benefits.In the present case, I think especially of the Total Fina group.The European Union can also represent the same ideas compared to the international maritime shipping organization.In this time, she would have demonstrated its benefits in the eyes of a public who expected clear and concrete actions.President, Ms. Commissioner!As a member of the French Atlantic coast from the Vendée department, I would first like to express the outrage that the population affected by the tanker Erika's oil spill feels in view of the devastating consequences that were not triggered by a natural disaster like the hurricane that also affected us, but by a crime.In the hour of need there was a wonderful wave of solidarity: at local, national and cross -border level.Now the affected population, those people who have lost everything, especially the professional groups who have been questioned from the sea and the tourism and their activity not only expect the causes to make the damage, but that everything will be done in order to teach from their current misfortune so that no other crimes will not become victims tomorrow.We now pay the price for our omissions.Because our states with the blessing of the community no longer thought it was useful to entertain their own merchant fleet, and it allowed that valuable know -how in the field of shipbuilding were lost, we no longer have a clear traceability of the ships and have to see how our waters of scrap are used to use the short -term interests of the multinational societies.This chain of irresponsibility from irresponsible teachers to unable to be found to be found to delicate certification companies must be put an end.We are in a difficult situation today.Of course, these things have to be regulated worldwide, but the current rules of the IMO are extremely inadequate and far too lax, and despite the previous disasters, neither our countries nor the community have seriously tried to make them strictly.Certainly there is the international fund against the environmental damage from mineral oils (FIPOL), but here the responsibilities are blurred, and the upper limit of the fund for compensation is absolutely inadequate and urgently needs the change.The question of the pleasure flags must be checked as part of the IMO.It is up to the Member States and the community to take the initiative for this.Let me remember that the Erika drove under the pleasure flag of a state that is the candidate for accession for the EU.	de
If these funds make it possible to remove delays from regions, cities and population groups or if health and the environment are improved, my group is satisfied.It is a question of solidarity and progress.But the fact that we always allocate more money does not guarantee that expenses improve accordingly.The cities and regions which benefit from funds have in the meantime acquired experience in the field.They find that it is extremely difficult to spend money on the objectives for which they need it most.The results are generally good with regard to economic growth and infrastructure, but social objectives and the environment are not always approved.As there is a great uncertainty concerning the way in which the rules are exposed, the municipalities and the regions spend fortunes to rent the services of expert offices which are responsible for assessing to what extent the officials of the European Commission are ready to approve their plans.In some cases, I have the impression that it is not a question of solidarity or to solve the most burning problems, but to maintain in place interests and propaganda in favor of the benefits of the European Union.It seems that the main objective is now to build and paint a propaganda panel on which the project is in question is co -financed by the European Union.Far too many funds are wasted in propaganda and design offices, in consultation and control and far too many funds return to the country from which they come.After the membership of new Member States, and their 100 million inhabitants whose standard of living reaches a third or two -thirds of the average of the current Member States of the European Union, this waste will arouse even more objections.Within the regional policy, transport and tourism policy, the unitary left group agreed with the rapporteur for opinion on leader, Mr. Nogueira Román.It is right that he found that it is not good to disperse these funds on all rural areas.Between innovation projects and the concentration of funds on the fight against delays, we opt for the latter objective because it contributes more to equality.Innovation in regions where it is already going well is already profitable and intervenes, even without European contribution.A second point which should be taken care of is the abuse of power and the cronyism policy whose regional and municipal administrations can be guilty.Emphasis is placed on local groups in which the authorities, non -profit organizations and for -profit companies cooperate.The discussion focused on the distribution key to be used.In particular, a variant was discussed which reminds of the Dutch polders model, structural cooperation organized between authorities, unions and entrepreneurs.Let us not forget that the elections of municipal councils and regional parliaments aim to represent the entire population.In fact, it would be that these bodies carry out an examination and that they take into account the wishes of sectoral organizations and ecological movements.	fr
It is in this spirit, almost provocatively, that we have presented an amendment intended to suggest the transfer of skills for southern Europe from foreign affairs to expansion.The fastest and most direct involvement of south-east Europe to the life of European institutions has led us to suggest that a limited number of observers are accepted, sent by national parliaments to the European Parliament, and that staff of those countries can work at the Court of Justice and the Commission.However, to encourage the evolution of the Region towards a more democratic society and more based on market economics, we are above all convinced that immediate and concrete steps must be taken to intensify the fight against corruption and to make international aid for reconstruction and development more efficient.For this reason we have presented some amendments, which I hope the Parliament will want to accept: first, to offer the former Republic of Macedonia a customs tariff equal to zero for its exports to the European Union and a compensation of the progressive reduction of customs rights applied by Macedonia on European products, provided that the principle of a combination of joint customs control is accepted;second, that the former Republic of Macedonia is encouraged, with adequate financial support, to gradually hook its coin to the euro as the first step towards a Europeanization of the entire Macedonian economy, and this with the further purpose of eliminating every possible corruption to the banking system;Third, that the help and assistance that the world must give to the Region, and therefore also to Macedonia, has the marked character of multilaterality, without conditioning the beneficiary country to obligations directed towards the donor country.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, Mr. Commissioner, we hope that the agreement can reach all the purposes that aims but we cannot delude ourselves that peace, stability and prosperity in the south -east of Europe can be achieved without dealing with themes on much wider problems, which we try to remove: I refer to the future constitutional state of Kosovo, to the need to involve Serbia in the process of reconciliation of the region andNo?- to the re -discussion of the relations between the European Union, NATO and the UN, in the light of the new balance to be found between humanitarian interference and state sovereignty, which I believe will have to change the same card as the UN.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, the war in Kosovo has created a climate of great instability.This instability above all characterizes the relationships between the European Union and the Western Balkans.Since then expectations have been particularly high, both in that region and in our countries.In that region why, whether we like it or not, in addition to the request for direct aid, the question that arises is: what does Europe intend to do with us?Is there the possibility of adhesion?These are very felt questions in all the countries in question.The expectations are also strong here by us, in the European Union.If we act correctly, this could be the first test of the existence of a true foreign policy and common security.	it
"That is why the institutions of the European Union have developed a comprehensive negotiating and consultation activity in the Amsterdam contract after taking the declaration No. 31, which ultimately culminated in the new decision of the Council, with which the old system is largely changed, but not satisfactorily changed for us.In particular, a check right of the parliament, i.e.h.The possibility introduced to ""ring the alarm bell"" if a measure to carry out a legal act issued according to the co -decision procedure violates the authorization authority transferred to the Commission.In the course of the lengthy interinstitutional negotiations, in which the parliament was actively involved thanks to the work of the rapporteur, Ms. Adelaide Aglietta, the goal was to conclude an interinstitutional agreement on the modalities of the application of certain aspects of the new decision.On the one hand, in order to clarify certain points that the Council was not willing to include in the decision, and on the other hand to regulate the information and control system with regard to the implementation measures more precisely.As part of the trilogue of October 6, 1999 in Strasbourg, the President of the European Parliament and the President of the Commission approved the proposal to conclude this agreement quickly.We believe that we have complied with this obligation, which, however, was relatively easy for us, since there was a climate of trust and mutual respect during the entire negotiation with the Commission.In the agreement, two points are essentially dealt with: On the one hand, this is the inform of the European Parliament as a conditio sine qua non for the actual exercise of his right of intervention in accordance with Article 8 of the decision.This information has so far been carried out on paper and unsystematically and was often unusable for our services, partly also by the guilt of the parliament itself.From now on, this information is ensured by an electronic system with the name Circa, to which the European Parliament has access and not only for us, but also - I am sure - is a real innovation for the commission.On the other hand, in Article 8 of the Council decision neither the procedure nor the deadline are mentioned, within which the European Parliament ""ring"" alarm bells, i.h.must exercise its limited control authority.In point 6 and 7 of the agreement it is stated that the European Parliament generally accepts its resolution in the plenum and has a period of one month to make use of its right to intervention before the commission's draft.However, we are all aware that it is not always possible to wait a month before a implementation measure is issued.Therefore, an urgency procedure is expressly provided for in the agreement, in the context of which the responsible committee can work.Finally, I would like to emphasize that we have to wait and see how the agreement works in practice before we can assess whether it is a good agreement or not.The European Parliament will have to equip itself with it not yet available in order to ensure an effective course of the implementing methods and effective control, and the commission will have to accept a reorganization of some of its procedures in order to ensure effective control and an actual information of parliament."	de
In the group of the People's Party there is no clear agreement on the question of supporting the mandatory quota regulation.Some members even speak against it.Personally, I don't want to feel a quota, I don't want to think that I am only on a certain position because I was born as a woman.This is a feeling that the men will never have, and an essential difference.I would also like to thank the minister and the commission member for their contributions, and I agree with the latter that it is time that beautiful words are converted into action.We all know how small the proportion of women in decision -making is at all levels, because we know the statistics, and they speak volumes.I agree that precise statistics are also necessary, because we will only learn from the fact that we slowly overcome the problems when we see how the numbers change.We will be able to recognize this with systematic monitoring.Mainstreaming is a long -term obligation.In the meantime we need positive measures, which means that we use odds and similar measures.We can learn from the mentioned successes, and not only by looking at the actual number of female MPs, but also on the effects they had on the government composition to clarify that everyone benefits from a really representative system.I am pleased that the proportion of women in the National Assembly in Wales, which I represent, is 40 %.That is the result of positive measures by the political parties;On the other hand, only four women from Wales are represented in the lower house, which is just 10 % of all MPs.Therefore, fundamental statements and basic support are not enough because they do not work.If we trust in the principle of equal representation of women and men in the decision structures, we have to participate in the measures that are necessary for its implementation.President!At the second international socialist women's conference in Copenhagen in 1910, it was decided to combine the main claim to combine voting rights for women with the entire question of women.In addition, as noted in the resolution, the women's day should be preserved and well prepared.It is also noteworthy that Women's Day was later banned in all countries in which fascism and racism came to power and between the wars.In 1910 the right to vote for women was on the agenda.Nowadays we focus on participating more women in the decision -making processes.Women are not a homogeneous group.They belong to different social classes, have different individual needs and interests.In general and continuously, however, regardless of where we are, regardless of class, breed or religion, whether at home or at work, we are subordinate to men in all areas of society - with a few individual exceptions, you should probably add.In my home country, Sweden, several political parties have voluntarily introduced a quota regulation for the election to political committees and the occupation of political offices in recent years.This has led to an increasing number of women in political decision -making, which in turn opened new opportunities for research.	de
"In September we promised to carry out a reform with the presentation of the White Paper and today we fulfill the acquired commitment, in the terms we have assumed before you.The Commission wants to be judged by the facts, only for the facts, on the basis of what we are going to do.However, I remind you - it is my last reflection - that the Commission is not the only community institution.Parliament and Council are also called to fully accept the challenge of these reforms.The commission has opened the road resolutely: I hope that all institutions travel until the end, at the service of European citizens, for an increasingly strong and increasingly transparent Europe.I am glad to be here with President Prodi and my colleague Michele Schreyer to present the White Paper ""Reform of the Commission"" approved by the commission this morning.As your lordships will see in the document, which will be available to you today, the unprecedented consultation to the commission staff, this Parliament and the Council, which has been made since the approval of the document on the consultation in January has been very productive and, as a result of it, useful improvements have been achieved.Together with Romano Prodi, I express my gratitude to this assembly and the large number of people who have dedicated time and efforts to give us their constructive responses.The White Paper places the reform in its appropriate political framework.In the Commission, systems and structures have been created for forty years in which there have been extensions achieved.The treaties have been reviewed, this Parliament and the Council have attributed new management tasks to the Commission and in our union, in our continent and in the world there have been many other changes of great importance.These realities, together with the approach of new extensions, strongly advise the modernization of the commission so that this essential institution can perform its primary tasks of conception and formulation of policies, application of the treaties and management of public resources and do so with the maximum efficiency, responsibility and democratic account of accounts.Naturally, the permanent independence and strength of the commission are fundamental for that mission, as this assembly has repeatedly recognized.Reform and renewal are also essential for that purpose.The commission is not and will be a secretariat of any kind and that is clear for all institutions ... That is something that is perfectly understood everywhere.But the Commission exists to be at the service of the Union and its peoples with high levels of performance.That is what citizens have the right to expect and what the people who work for the commission want to offer and offer.As the Assembly must know, the Commission cannot achieve those objectives alone.All European Union institutions will have to face the issues raised by the reform and do so with honesty and responsibility.I know that my colleagues and I can count on the support of many deputies to this assembly of all trends."	es
A small step - he said - however, welcome, to which the Commission of Liberties and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs has rightly wanted to impose further limits and cautious in the name of the defense of the fundamental rights of the people, recognized in the states and in the union itself, despite the fact that they are not yet enshrined in a letter of fundamental rights of the European Union that we trust will soon come to light.Successful limits and precautions because, unfortunately, not always all public authorities specifically respect all rights in force in all states.At some specific point of the commission's proposals, there have perhaps there has been an excess of caution, such as when the accused arrested the option to consent or reject temporary transfer to another Member State of the Union due to instruction needs.Personally I do not consider acceptable, for example, that Mr. Pinochet is allowed to choose whether or not to move to Spain for a care.Or when it has also been intended that the witness or the expert - and not only the investigated and the accused - is advised by a defender in the distance interrogation.However, these are small failures that the speaker has committed unintentionally and that the vote of this plenary will remedy.The rapporteur has put a commendable effort to recognize and thank him.The global result is appreciable and I hope the council will take it into account.As stated, there is an unsolved point, the most delicate: refers to article 18 of the agreement concerning the listenings of communications that are carried out in a Member State and that makes another member state directly, without requesting the assistance of the State in which the listener is carried out, which today is possible, thanks to the modern technologies.The question is very controversial to be a possible source of abuse.It could be argued that the complex proposed regulation is better than anything, but the commission has seemed insufficient and disturbing.Consequently, when the contradictory news about Echelon evokes the ghost of the Big Brother, it deserves a further reflection that must probably be more global about the media and the systems through which, on the one hand, the rights of the people must be protected and, on the other, an effective and at the same time correct and legitimate repression of the crime must be allowed.Therefore, the objective is to achieve as far as possible a delicate balance between the effectiveness of the fight against crime and respect for the freedom and dignity of people.An objective that, today, is not only something of states, but has become something of the union policy that aspires to become a common space of freedom, justice and security.It is a distant goal, but it can be achieved by progressive stages.	es
And, above all, and with that I conclude, Mrs. President, Ladies, we have to be able to express this in flat language, clearly, changing in some ways the jargon that we handle, because we cannot ask Europeans, who are living times of profound changes, that they adhere and get excited about us if we continue to maintain an absolutely closed and back language to them.This is the fundamental means of increasing and reinforcing the confidence that, in any case, I hope it can be measured in the next European elections.Mr. President of the Commission, allow me to tell you, on behalf of my group, that we firmly support the starting point, the core of the analysis and the strategy that today presents to the Assembly;namely that the bet is now undeniably political.And it is political, because we are moving forward.Although we have not yet finished building all the basic pieces, we are advancing from that type of functional construction of Europe to a political perspective that is a greater challenge.The challenge of expansion is political.The challenge of the creation of a space for justice and internal issues, to address the issue of asylum and immigration and crime is very political.The challenge of a common external defense and security policy is very political.And because it is political, it is more complex.Because it is political is more susceptible to sovereignty.Because it is more susceptible to sovereignty, it is more susceptible to voters and citizens.Therefore, we must find a way to advance until we reach those goals and political objectives, to overcome not only skepticism, but also the greatest enemy of all, which is the apathy to which it has referred.The means to achieve this are not easy, but they are real.I applaud your opinion that we need more synergy between our institutions, not only between the commission and the Parliament, but also between these two and the Council to highlight the scope of the political challenge.We need more dialogue, not only among us, but also with civil society.More explanations are needed to know what Europe is about.We must overcome fears and anxieties, because in many cases, the greatest fears is fear.Perhaps with more dialogue and explanations we can overcome some of these fears.My group feels especially attracted to the creative possibilities that you have pointed out regarding the perspective of presenting a white paper in next spring, which addresses the issue of the Government.When we contemplate the Europe of the networks that you describe, it is very important that Europe focuses on its main themes, that we have the value of focusing the areas in which Europe could be behind.In this way, the population could be convinced that Europe, in its governorate, is not something that is directed exclusively from Brussels, in an attempt to concentrate and absorb more competencies, more decisions and more authority.Here is the political core of the challenge, and I think you have exposed it today to this assembly perfectly.For my group, the extension is the first priority with which all other possible reforms must be measured, whether the Government, whether the intergovernmental conference or the reform of the institutions.	es
The summit of Lisbon starts with this inheritance and must develop it in those aspects in which it has not yet been consolidated, and that are not a few because we do not yet have a uniform internal market in the areas we want to advance in Lisbon: due to delays, there is no uniform internal market, for example, in public and private services or in the use of modern technologies, for the markets with regard to the informationAnd thus to really complete efficiency.Here the necessary increase in productivity must now be set in order to achieve long -lasting economic development without inflation.However, we have to be careful.Perhaps we dismember this debate about Lisbon, but we always have to keep an extremely precise goal in mind: We have to create the economic and social conditions for sustainable growth.We have already mentioned the economic conditions, namely efficiency and productivity;The social conditions are about avoiding fragmentation and income gap in our society - one of the greatest dangers.I emphasize again, because we should be commemorating: The income gap has been increasing in Europe recently.If not today, this problem will be insoluble tomorrow.This results in both the responsibility of the market and public responsibility.In Lisbon we have to make some very concrete decisions.I would like to point out a special aspect, since referring to the United States in various ways.In the United States, this new market, this innovation and its distribution - the huge leap forwards are that this is an innovation, namely in the telematics area, by which knowledge is also carried into the outskirts - by no means owe only the private initiative.Extensive public investments were made, federal, national and local level.Enormous sums were invested in modern infrastructure.Attention, in this regard, our immediate - I repeat, immediate - commitment on the public level and the other levels in the telematics compounds, i.h.to set up the paths for these new information carriers.The market, the private individuals, companies will provide the carriers while we are obliged to create the new data highways.Therefore, the obligation mentioned by Prime Minister Guterres can not only be left to the market for the equipment of all schools with computers and to the network extending to the outskirts, because the market will simply not do so, and on the other hand, we will not achieve the new, necessary productivity goals without these measures.We therefore have to avoid that the peripheral economic sectors get into a crisis, which in no way means centralization or centralized planning, but it means that we open up the same opportunities for the peripheral economy as the centralized economy.For this reason, the program must be geared towards the schools, so we have to take on an entire age group and penetrate it, stand up to ensure that there is no longer a single age group that is not captured by this new literacy.There is therefore a precise strategy for Lisbon.In Lisbon, in my opinion, it is mainly about sowing new courage for employment and growth, in the consciousness that we are able to do so;So we have to move to this model, which is based on safe equilibriums.	de
I would like to go into a chapter that seems to me to be a bit incomplete that of social policy.That would not be that bad if considerable progress had been made in the past five years, but this is not the case.In the area of ​​social policy, however, the Commission and Parliament have the opportunity to move a lot.I think in particular here in Chapter 1 of Title XI of the Treaty and especially the question of working conditions and the improvement of the work environment.With regard to the health protection and the security of the employees, a guideline from 1989 is currently valid. In my opinion, and in the opinion of my faction, this guideline should be checked in particular on the basis of a comprehensive investigation published by Dublin in 1997.In this study, a general deterioration in working conditions is found in a number of important areas.This should be considered and I would like the commission to seriously deal with this matter and determine how this directive must be changed to improve the situation.I do not want to go into the details in terms of content, but something with the processes in the context of the legislative program, i.e.h.deal with the presentation of the program and its implementation.To do this, I would like to present two emphatic demands of the Greens' faction, of which I would have liked to adopt the parliament.But today they should only be expressed here as emphatic claims.First of all, if a resolution by the high house is accepted, particularly in the context of an initiative of the European Parliament, then in my opinion the democratic rules of the game require that such a requirement by the Commission is seriously treated within a reasonable period of time.So we have z.B. in the environmental area there is a white book on civil liability for environmental damage.This is a major progress, but I would like to remind you that this white book on a resolution of the 1994 Parliament, i.h.from six years ago.And after the white book, there is certainly plenty of time until a guideline appears.This makes it clear that the procedure is very slow and to explain why so much time is needed, a report is required in my opinion.Second: If a legislative proposal is announced in the legislative program, but its implementation is not carried out in the current year, the reasons for this must be presented.In addition an example.Today, a proposal for a guideline on electrical and electronic scrap is announced.This proposal has already been mentioned several times, but it has never been adopted.We know that this was based on the pressure of the US government that threatens with a lawsuit in front of the WTO, but it would make sense, fair, fair, democratic and transparent if the commission explained what is happening behind the scenes and why the submission of this guideline is long.Allow me to express my fears and fears with regard to the approach of your program for the year of 2000 you described as a year of the turn - and not just because it does not contain any really innovative suggestions.What worries us is rather the programmatic, semi -ideological approach of this work plan, its submissive and uncritical takeover of the US model - that anti -social and doped development model, the personalities that are sublime about every suspicion, such as the president of the Federal Reserve, Alan Greenspan.	de
The third goal consists in urban and rural development within the framework of a balanced spatial planning policy.The guidelines are also based on two horizontal principles: the development of rural areas - and the question of a sustainable traffic structure, Mrs. Ms. Rapportein, which has long been concerned with my heart, especially since my time as the Environment Minister of my country, belongs to me in the field of development of rural areas - and the second principle is equal opportunities, especially between women and men, as well as the European employment strategy and the economic and currency union.Ms. rapporteur, ladies and men, I would like to say about the concerns expressed in the pronunciation that the guidelines indicate the importance and determination of integrated development or conversion strategies, so that the priorities mentioned enable the greatest possible synergy effects of the measures and effective decentralized partnerships.They are worried because this partnership apparently has not been discussed.However, it is clearly mentioned on page 5 of these guidelines, and I would like to refer to it - because they have asked me - that this partnership for me - and I have looked after a region for long enough to be able to assess - is a very effective instrument for mobilizing intellectual resources at local level - both those in the public sector - the city and municipalities, the school and social areas, the associations and associations - as well asthose of the private sector.And the territorial pacts are one of the forms of this decentralized partnership to respond to a remark from Ms. Angelilli.The guidelines are ordered according to topic -related priorities so that they can be taken into account to different degrees within the framework of the individual goals depending on the specific situation of each Member State or its regions.Well, ladies and gentlemen, I would like to briefly respond to some of your comments;First to the procedure.It is true that your house was only dealt with late.However, I would like to remind you that after the guidelines in the form of a draft in February 1999 according to a new procedure in which the submission of statements on the text had been passed, you were immediately forwarded to Parliament by my predecessor, Ms. Monika Wulf-Mathies.However, due to the upcoming European elections at the time, their house was only able to begin examining the guidelines after the text was finally adopted in July 1999.Today I can assure you, ladies and gentlemen, that we are only at the beginning during the negotiations on the programs - the committee chairman Mr. Hatzidakis has already asked me about this - and that your comments from most Member States can therefore actually be taken into account.I can also tell you that the Commission will take into account the opinion of your house, which is expressed in this report, when passing the guidelines for the prescribed so -called half -time valuation.Now on the content of the guidelines.Ms. rapporteur, you underlined that this is about making specifications for a number of often very precisely defined European goals.I cannot now call everyone: Introduction of cross -sector measures, more efficient use of public funds, support of the different partners in the joint development of regional or national programs, etc. The Commission takes note of this, but these specifications or questions do not belong here, for example, but, for example, in the Vademecum or the methodological document.	de
We therefore propose to change the legislation as follows.Firstly, it should only be reserved for public structures what is built thanks to Life Fondi, also at the cost of entrusting, with a tender, the management of the sites in question to associations recognized for the protection of nature.The continuity of the projects started, since private law associations can disappear or resell.It is aberrant from a philosophical point of view, as well as contestable from a legal point of view, that 100 percent of public money serves to build a private land assets, even if with the claim to protect the environment.Secondly, the selection and attribution criteria of the Life funds should be defined, in order to avoid any suspicion of clientelism or ostracism.Thirdly, a preventive consultation of users and interested bodies should be requested.For example, in France, the Life-Nature project for Grand -lu, developed without any concertation, has proved to be a real ecological catastrophe: the operations intended to free the watercourse at the valley from the melma, Acheneau, and conducted in violation of the French law on the waters, have caused its interraction, destroying braking, invading wetlands and causing other consequences.In reality, all that was achieved was a 3 -kilometer movement of the melma with a cost of 6 million francs: a remedy that proved worse than evil, a predictable consequence and announced by all the operators of the site.Result?A cause and a cost of restoration higher than the sum allocated by the program.This is what we want to avoid.Fourth, in the committee in charge of the follow-up representatives of Parliament and, at least, a deputy for each political group should be included in the committee in charge of the follow-up.Deputies must control the use of funds for which they voted: it seems more than legitimate.In fifth place, a scientific, technical and financial report of the Life operations carried out should be published annually.In sixth place, a serious and regular evaluation of the programs should be carried out.In seventh place, the use of these funds should be allowed in cases of environmental emergency, for example, reforestation after a storm, restoring natural spaces after a black tide, etc.Here, Mr. President, honorable speaker, the concrete, sensible proposal, simple to implement, aimed at limiting conflicts at the local level and justifying the correct use of public funds, which we advance before any increase?of 40 percent at least!?of the funds allocated for Life.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, I would like to congratulate the Honorable Lienemann in the first place for the elaborate relationship, but also with the commission because this relationship, this position, improves the texts currently in force.In addition, it has a more acceptable, clearer and transparent structure.I would also like to congratulate the commission services, as the evaluation, control and sequel to the Life program reasonably guarantee the selection and execution of the projects.However, I would like to dwell on some aspects.First of all, on its continuity in which, in principle, I believe.	it
From community institutions, we are obliged to work to overcome these border scars, which involve a contradiction with the spirit of European unity.The economic and social cohesion that we advocate is concretized, through the Interreg initiative, in territorial cohesion and in the integration of border spaces and the peripheries of our continent.Interreg is since its origin in the germ of an authentic community policy of territory management and a truly polycentric conception of the European territory.The European Parliament, according to this initiative, only regrets that we have to approve a resolution on it when we still do not know the evaluation of Interreg II, but we are aware that it is not convenient to delay the application of this third edition, since we would endanger the success of several projects and the continuity of projects that are already underway, because the success of Interreg is evident and this is expressed by local, regional and national authorities that have participated in projectsco -financed.Learn together, innovate, share projects and share good practices, understand and tolerate each other, are some of the lessons that allows you to learn from this initiative to those who participate in it.There are a whole series of interesting issues around it, the observatory, the principle of concentration ... I would like to stop in the management bodies.It is necessary to seek common, interregional and transnational management bodies, in which all local and regional authorities actively participate, as well as economic and social agents.No cases of parallel projects should be repeated on either side of the border.We need to create a cross -border culture, and for this it is necessary to innovate in administrative cooperation, overcoming with imagination the existing barriers, overcoming the difficulties of the different degrees of competencies of each Member State, of each region and of each municipality.It cannot be that a project cannot be carried out due to interlocution difficulties.During commission debates, we have also found the difficulty of coordinating Interreg with other annual or biannual financial instruments, such as Meda, Tacis or Phare.The proposal for resolving this Parliament has been very attentive to these difficulties, formulating the commission proposals capable of solving them and putting reasonable deadlines to make the necessary modifications.Mr. President, I want to intervene in this debate because the Urban initiative has been very successful, especially in Ireland, and satisfies me that the European Union continues to contribute in that area.It is very sad that hundreds of communities, if not thousands, suffer poverty and disadvantages so deep.Even in the richest member states and cities there are a large number of people who live in ghettos, in situations in which there are inappropriate facilities, where education is quite bad, where physical infrastructure are underdeveloped and where drugs and other problems are widespread.It seems to me that, for the European Union to demonstrate that it really helps the citizens of the EC, it must collaborate with the Member States to make it clear that the EU works for citizens and their families.	es
It is very useful.It is an excellent contribution from Mr. Swoboda and his colleagues.We are very grateful to him to have been in the foreground in this area, as well as some of his colleagues, some of whom are present this evening within the Assembly - Ms. Pack, Mr. Lagendijk and others.I am very satisfied with what our general relations with ARYM are as good.Perhaps Mr. Dupuis, as well as his interpreter, will forgive me to use this expression in the spirit of the cordial agreement.The excellent representative of the European Union in this country has contributed to it.He was a great friend of the European Parliament and an excellent servant of the Commission.The best example illustrating the quality of our relationships is the imminent start of negotiations on the stabilization and association agreement.As is also the cooperation of ARYM with regard to the reconstruction of Kosovo.I thank the Macedonian authorities for helping their help in recent weeks, in order to cope with the considerable difficulties in electricity supply to Kosovo.Like certain deputies, I recognize the stabilizing role that this country played during the tragedy which took place in the Balkans, in particular with regard to the integration of the Albanian minority in the political and social life of the country.A few weeks ago, I saw the new president Georgievski, recently elected, and I was extremely impressed, like others, by his commitment to multi -thnicity and pluralism.Let me present to you the state of these negotiations than other countries in the region - as Mr. Lagendijk said - observe with immense interest.The Council adopted, on January 24 of this year, its negotiation directives for a stabilization and association agreement with the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.This represents the most important step in the process of stabilization and association of the western part of the Balkans initiated by the Commission in May 1999. Allow me to clarify the main elements of these directive projects.They cover inclusion in the arrangement agreement establishing a political dialogue with ARYM.They cover provisions with a view to improving regional cooperation, including the prospect of establishing free trade areas between the countries of the region, although I would clearly say that there is no question of an attempt to recreate the state of Yugoslavia.They cover the prospect of the establishment of a free trade area between the European Union and these countries during the ten years which will follow the entry into force of the agreement.They cover provisions concerning the circulation of workers, freedom of establishment, the provision of services, current payments and capital movements.They cover an ARYM commitment to bring its legislation closer to that of the European Community, especially in key fields on the domestic market;And they cover provisions concerning cooperation with ARYM in a wide range of fields, including justice and domestic affairs.We now carry out the necessary preparations in the Commission so that negotiations can start in March.I have to go to Arym in the second week of March.	fr
"After two elections of the European Parliament and an important new reform of the Union Treaties, our relations with the Czech Republic developed in an extremely dynamic way.A association agreement is in force and a mixed parliamentary commission has been established with delegates of the European Parliament and the Czech one.In 1996 his country submitted the official application to enter the Union.Finally, in 1998 the adhesion negotiations were officially started.The European integration and expansion process have undergone an impressive acceleration after the fall of the iron curtain.The end of Europe's artificial separation marks the beginning of a new era.A historical challenge awaits us that presents various perspectives for all Europeans.Mr. President, she who was also founder and signatory of paper 77 - the defense movement of human rights that represented and claimed the fundamental values ​​in a dark period of the history of its people - represents an incisive symbol of these evolutions.For defending the freedom and dignity of the person she was sentenced to almost five years in prison by a communist regime.But he never lost hope and history has given her right.Ten years have passed since the ""velvet revolution"" claimed Havel Na Hrad.For ten years she represented, as president, first the Democratic Czechoslovakia and then the Czech Republic.Reconciliation with her neighbors has always constituted an essential objective for her, defended with firmness and perseverance.We consider it a first -rate European.Today the Czech Republic is preparing to become a member of our union.Experience has taught us, and you Mr. President will converge that the process of expanding the Union is not always without pitfalls, for both sides.The Czech Republic will therefore have to undergo significant efforts to satisfy all membership conditions.The European Union, for its part, will have to adapt its institutions and its policy in view of the expansion.It has already taken a large step forward in the agenda 2000. The next stage, which consists of the institutional reform, will start this year on the occasion of the new intergovernmental conference, of which the European Parliament is an active part.Our responsibility as deputies consists in guaranteeing maximum opening and transparency so that, at the right time, the citizens of the European Union and those of the Czech Republic approves, through their representatives, the adhesion of the Czech Republic to the European Union.Mr. President, I leave her word with immense pleasure.(Applause) Mr. President, on behalf of the European Parliament, I want to thank you highly for the strong message that he addressed us and, moreover, the applause of the colleagues testify to what we appreciated his words.I would like to thank you for reminding us that the different nationalities are perfectly compatible with European belonging.Starting from his personal experience, he illustrated that European belonging cannot be imposed, as it constitutes a spontaneous and natural path.His words struck me: they express what we all feel deeply."	it
I declare the session of the European Parliament interrupted.(The session is lifted at 12:25 pm) Resumption of the session I declare the session of the European Parliament, which had been interrupted on Thursday, February 3, 2000. Adoption of the minutes of the previous session The minutes of the session on Thursday, February 3 was distributed.Are there observations?I note from your reaction that many deputies have not had this report and it is obvious that you cannot adopt a report that you did not have.I therefore propose to submit it to your approval tomorrow morning, since obviously you do not have it and I apologize.The adoption of the minutes is therefore postponed.Madam President is a procedural motion.This morning, the BBC reported that a British deputy for this assembly, which held a high position within its delegation, continues to provide strategic advice to private customers without however declaring in the register of financial interests of which it is.European citizens have the right to expect their representatives that they do not mix public interests and private advantages.However, they cannot be certain that it is not only if the information is both available to the public and easy to access.Madam President, since these questions are currently being examined by quaestors, can I ask you to use your influence at the same time to ensure that the register of financial interests be updated and modified in order to cover cases of this kind, and, above all, to ensure that this register can not only be the subject of an examination on the part of this assembly but that it is also published on the Internet?Thank you, Mr. Davies.I will see this question with the College of Quaestors.Madam President is a procedural motion.Since we are celebrating the first Valentine's Day today of the new millennium, I hope you agree that this parliament will be appropriate for this day by firmly committing to tackling the issue of cardiovascular disease, which are the main cause of mortality in Europe.I am urging the member states to align themselves with the commitment made today during the Winning Hearts Conference, namely that any child born in the new millennium has the right to live at least up to 65 years without suffering from avoidable cardiovascular disease.Happy Valentine's Day!Madam President, I intervene in accordance with article 9 of the regulation of this assembly and I refer to the point raised by Mr. Davies concerning the very serious allegations broadcast on BBC radio this morning.I would appreciate that you guarantee us that you will order an investigation to ensure that the two deputies appointed in this particular interview with the BBC do not direct their companies from this parliament or parliamentary offices, because it would be very serious indeed.The policy of two weights, two measures followed in the past by the British conservatives, has thrown discredit on the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, and such behavior would strongly have a similar impact on this Parliament.	fr
"And he does the same.We have argued, we express unanimity, with the exception of the PPE groups and the European Party of Democratic and Reformist liberals, and I managed to notice - as my dear fellow presidents will remember it - that it is not about knowing if you are in favor or against the Tax Todin, but to know if they dare to understand what the commission and the Council think about it.It is not asking too much.Therefore, I reiterate the proposal to maintain this oral question to the commission and the Council to know once and for all what is the position of those two organs in regard to this relatively modest proposal, but that would be an important signal for opinion, especially after the shock that aroused the failure of the Seattle Conference.The proposal of the PPE-de Group is voted to withdraw from the agenda the oral question referred to the capital tax.(Parliament rejects the proposal for 164 votes in favor, 166 votes against and 7 abstentions) Mrs. President, I want to thank Mr. Poettering for the advertising he has just given to this debate.Thank you.Mrs. President, has my vote been counted, which could not be made electronically, because I don't have the card?My vote was ""in favor.""Mrs. President, the Presidency has proclaimed the result of the vote.There are no modifications.Mrs. President, in the previous vote - and I attended her decision in this matter - on the question of the strategic plan of the commission, I indicated that I would have liked to speak before the vote on behalf of my group.This has not happened.I would appreciate that, at the close of this point, I would be allowed to give an explanation of the vote on behalf of my group.It is an important issue.It would be useful for the camera history to record how people perceive what we have done in the light of their own political analysis.Mrs. President, I do not want to resume the debate, but I had also asked for the word to give my opinion about the amendment of Mr. Barón Crespo.Nor have you named me.I regret it, but the vote has been made, the decision has been adopted and, therefore, let's leave things.I'm very sorry, Mr. Hänsch, Mr. Cox, I have not warned that you asked for the word.In these circumstances, I believe that the positions are clear and that they will be reflected in the minutes. When the approval of the act of today's session is, if their lordships estimate that the positions have not been explained well enough, they will be able to ask for modifications.I think it's a good formula.Of course, the minutes of the tomorrow session will consign all complementary explanations.I think this formula is better than to now proceed to vote explanations that would take us a lot of time.Mr. Hänsch, Mr. Cox, do you think?Mrs. President, if in the voting record it consists correctly how my group has voted, nor do I want nor can I consider any objection."	es
The values ​​must pass before power.We therefore deplore what is happening in Austria.Even more, we are shaken.We are deeply disappointed.We ask the ÖVP to further examine other solutions.We continue to insist on article 6 of the treaty.We continue to fight the trivialization of the far right.If the coalition still came to train, we call on our ÖVP colleagues to guarantee themselves in their programs, as well as in their words and in their gestures, of respect for the principles and values ​​which constitute the foundations of European integration.Madam President, my dear colleagues, Austria must face a heavy responsibility.Madam President, Ladies and Gentlemen, it is obvious that within this Parliament, we are very widely agreed in our rejection of Haider and its policy, but it is just as clear that the opinions diverge as to the question of how to best fight this policy.Have you only asked yourself about the repercussions in Austria of this debate and the declaration made last weekend by the presidency of the council?Did you ask yourself the question of knowing our share of responsibility in the future development of the political situation in Austria if we decide to make a judgment on this file?You only asked yourself what would happen if the view of one of our colleagues was granted and that elections took place in Austria in the coming days.In the unanimous opinion of the observers, Haider would come out even stronger.Who may want such a thing?Do we not have the responsibility of carefully thinking about how to fight such a policy?Europe is a community of law.Among the principles that we must defend, there is democracy, respect for human law and the rule of law.The democratic requirement implies that we can deplore electoral results but that we must respect them and that is why we must respect the decision taken by the Austrians for reasons inherent in their policy.The rule of law requires that the presidency of the council will not be expressed as it did, in a way that contradicts the treaties.Politic intelligence commands not to isolate the ÖVP but to support it, as an undoubtedly democratic party, respectful of the rule of law and having demonstrated its European commitment, so that Austria remains in a just as undoubtedly undoubtedly a member of this European community.This is why we must support our ÖVP colleagues in this difficult situation and isolation is a completely wrong path.(Applause) Madam President, we say where I come from that a Welshman always takes it three times.It is actually three times - as you will notice during this debate - that I mean my desire to respond very briefly to what was an excellent, and sometimes disturbing, debate.First of all, I would like to thank, on behalf of the President Prodi and my colleagues from the Commission, several deputies of this assembly for their support and their understanding vis-à-vis the position taken by the Commission in the declaration that we made yesterday.	fr
"Likewise, I support a movement towards a linear career system, since the current system of career groups no longer meets the needs of our institutions.It certainly blocks the progress and mobility of people with demonstrably high performance potential.Those MEPs who have duly praised the commission staff in the course of this debate, whose vast majority are normally characterized by hard work, high integrity and performance, are absolutely right with their statements.The white book on the reform strategy will contain a detailed presentation of our concepts on this and other topics;Accuracy in detail is of course the top priority here.There will therefore be some messages for this in the coming months, and each individual will be advised and discussed here in this plenary.In the meantime, there is absolute clarity that we have to work closely with the parliament as an institution in central questions of common interest, in particular on the service and care payments as well as the civil servant statute.In connection with this last point, we are considering whether it would be useful to assume a framework regulation that contains general provisions on important questions such as salary, employment conditions, personnel representative rights, etc., but authorizes the individual institutions to introduce implementation provisions on other facts.Initial thoughts from the plenum about this consultative concept would be particularly welcome.In conclusion, I would like to go into paragraph 15 of the draft deflection in which the middle requirements of our reform strategies are addressed.This is a very important point.We are certain that we will have a significant ""reform dividend"" as soon as the modernization measures have been reflected in increased efficiency and better management of the use of funds.However, there is absolute clarity that parts of the commission service are already fully utilized.This has already been addressed by Parliament several times.Second, it is also clear that due to the reform, some new investments for qualification measures and technology are required.Third, there is completely no doubt that the preparations for the expansion must be intensified.Already now they have an impact on the availability of funds.It is also clear that with the assumption of new tasks - which is certainly brought to us by the council and parliament - we will have to name and sort so -called ""negative priorities"" in order to create additional capacities.Central feature of our reform will therefore be more determined in order to combine the determination of priorities with the funds on the basis of the measures -related budgeting.However, I would like to emphasize that the internal discipline is introduced by the Commission when setting the priority, but it can only be effective if the parliament and the council also take into account it and show a similarly determined attitude in relation to the claims of the Commission.For this reason, the Commission welcomes paragraph 15 of the report van Hulten.Mr President, I would like to come to the end and thank the Hohen house for his attention during an inevitable speech.At the same time, I would like to thank the rapporteur, the committee for household control and the other committees who have submitted their statements.We look forward to close cooperation with the plenary in the final formulation of the reform strategy package and, which is much more important, to constantly good cooperation in all the years that are necessary for the solution of such difficult tasks."	de
"It is simply recognizing their inferiority.But that I know, we never felt lower than men, and all the more in politics.So I believe that we all lead this fight to help our compatriots to access decision-making power, to access positions of responsibility in the political environment, but I believe that this will only be done with a real revolution of mentalities.We must be strong enough together to force our political leaders to impose the participation of women in political decision-making powers..(SV) Mr. President, Madam Minister, Madam Commissioner, ""half of the sky is supported by women,"" said an enlightened man one day.But when it comes to important decisions and priority subjects, women are lacking.Women, which constitute more than half of the population, are largely underrepresented in the fields of politics, economics and social action.It is an unacceptable fact in a democracy.Regarding equality between men and women, the gap between law and facts is nowhere more marked than in decision -making bodies.So that we can reach a balance, a concrete action plan with a fixed calendar is necessary.An important part of this plan would consist in a benchmarking system that can ensure the full participation of women in power structures and decision -making processes.I therefore be delighted that the commissioner is favorable to such a system.I propose that the European objectives concerning the participation of women in decision -making processes are based on the average obtained in the three most advanced member states in this area, with an annual report provided by all the Member States.These reports would then be the subject of an evaluation.Women are the first victims of human rights violations - in particular with rapes and sexual abuses, the ill -treatment suffered in the domestic framework and the trade of women - but they are underrepresented in the judicial and legislative institutions responsible for judging these criminal acts.As a result, these are not considered priority, and that very often, their authors are not the subject of prosecution.Women are also the most numerous victims of armed conflicts, but nevertheless remain absent from actions in favor of preserving peace, conflict resolution and reconstruction work.This is why we urge the Member States, in the text of the resolution, to increase the number of women who take part in all these activities in the service of peace.Equality between female and male participation in decision -making processes is not solely of social justice and democracy;It is also a necessity, to be able to fully exploit the experiences lived by women and their knowledge.The fact of not calling on the capacities of women in the decision -making process represents an unacceptable waste.Women must not only ""support half of the sky"", but also have the right to take their share of responsibility in decisions concerning the whole earth.Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the presidency of the council and the commissioner for their excellent interventions.We expect a lot from your action.We start a millennium and a century which we hope will be decisive for women and for their possibility of occupying places of decision."	fr
"If in a general direction it is considered that this is a pertinent and effective way to increase financial control, the ex -sudden system can be used.Naturally, there are different requirements throughout the commission according to the number and nature of the financial transactions that the general directorates must carry out.In the White Paper, that is also taken into account, but in cases where there is desire and the demonstrated need to use that system, it can be done without a doubt.Finally, with respect to the transition, I share the reserves of Mrs. Theato on the so -called ""flexible standards.""That is something that we have already discussed and their honor knows that I make a distinction between the various forms of codes that can have a positive effect and at the time they can become - we could say, I suppose - ""imperative norms.""But in that regard I see any possibility of flexible norms, which is why in the transition period there will be a total compliance with the current financial regulation until the legislation is modified through a duly democratic process in this assembly and in the Board.In the White Paper include absolute guarantees and provisions in this regard.Now, in addition -and it is something very important, because it is a period of transition -there will be training, advice, support, guarantees: the new head of the audit unit will occupy his position on May 1 and with that and with a cluster of other guarantees I think we can be safe, to the extent of the humanly possible, that there will be a totally safe system even during the transition period.I must formulate two other observations, because it is an essential issue for reform.The first is that there are those who have the sensation - for reasons that I understand perfectly - that in that transition there is a danger of irresponsibility or inertia.Irresponsibility, because there is a sensation in some means that there will be not enough control and discipline.I completely reject it and for this I simply rely on the criteria of the commission officials, the responsibility of the general directors and the guarantees that we have introduced into the system.Inertia would be exclusively consequence of anxiety and we are doing everything we can in terms of support and training to reduce the possibility of it.Finally, the system we currently have - as the Committee of Independent Experts said very firmly - is already unsustainable.In fact, the Court of Accounts has considered it a fiction.In any case, there will have to be a change, which would entail a transition period, because there is no possibility of inventing any system that could allow us to move from one system to another from one Friday to the following Monday.To the extent that it is possible with all the information we have and all the capacity for conception we have, I am sure we have installed - or we will install - from our proposals a system that will provide the Union, its taxpayers and this assembly a complete security."	es
"Greater control at national level, by national governments on national banks, but also greater international control through, for example, the International Monetary Fund.I therefore believe that the causes of the problem can be tackled at the best if, from a song, in the countries concerned, good government practices will be kept due to respect and, by the other song, if greater control at national and international level will be guaranteed to avoid these uncontrolled phenomena.Mrs. President, several members of Parliament have said that larger funds should be allocated for large projects.Honorable Kreissl-Dörfler, for example, spoke, in English, of ""Long Term Financing for Long Terg Term Projects"".It is an absolutely obvious request.My response to this request is that first of all the countries should maintain their promise to allocate 0.7 percent of their gross national product in favor of help and development cooperation, so that, compared to today, a much greater volume of funding can be used for long -term projects according to the methods specifically provided for for this purpose, that is, through contributions to development cooperation, and not through the Tabin tax, which would be a form of artificial financing,And probably harmful.Lady president, I wish to conclude my intervention here.As for the resolution, of which I saw a proposal, the Commission awaits that it knows the result of Parliament's vote to define its position.Thank you for offering me the opportunity to participate in tonight's discussion.I communicate that I have received four resolution proposals pursuant to article 40, paragraph 5, of the regulation.Lady president, unfortunately I do not have his mastery of French.However, I would rejoice if the commissioner Bolkestein listened for a moment, which I don't think possible since he is talking to the honorable Randzio-Plath.Could you remind him that I still have something to say?Monsieur Bolkestein, je veux vous say that chose!Unfortunately I don't speak Dutch as well as her.However, I would like to express some consideration for his address.The fact that we are in favor of the Tobin Tax does not represent an initiative of Parliament against the Commission.We want to evaluate the possibilities of introducing this tax as one of the many possible tools and in this we hope it will be on our side.From a political point of view I always have some doubts when it is stated that an initiative is not necessary, we do not want it, we cannot apply it.Adopting a decision about it is not his task, but ours.This demonstrates to a certain extent the new awareness that has awakened at the level of Parliament.I would like to discuss it with her, nothing more, nothing less.However, we can leave any other path immediately;I consider it a serious commissioner who intends to carry out his work with commitment and as such respects it.Please in turn respect us deputies who intend to face our tasks with the same seriousness, including the Tobin Tax!Lady president, it seems that there is a forgetfulness and that, in the list of the resolved resolutions, that she has just mentioned, does not appear the proposal to resolve the common compromise presented by the PSE, the liberals, the Gue group, the green and the honorable Kuntz and Coûteaux."	it
This coordination does not exist at the moment, and the commission has not yet submitted concrete proposals to improve coordination.Here, in Parliament, we are waiting for the Commission to give our parliamentary commission as soon as possible a more detailed report on this matter.It is of decisive importance to ensure that companies, organizations and other local agents participate in the practical execution of the programs.Experience shows that cooperation projects must be better planned, that the monitoring of them must be more precise and that they need to behave greater performance.Many projects have been halfway and have lost efficacy in the network of administration and bureaucracy.The parties must also be required to commit to the projects and that fulfill their obligations.Our group returns to several amendments that were rejected by the parliamentary commission during preparations.I want to submit the report on Urban to consideration, in whose argument the rapporteur has addressed in a plausible way the guidelines of the commission regarding the establishment of a minimum sum of 500 euros per inhabitant.This does not proceed to carry it out as a mechanical objective, but must be adapted to the specific conditions of the destination region.This point of view is so important that it must be included in the conclusions, and not stay in mere argument.Mr. President, dear colleagues, Interreg is one of the structural funds.In it, not only projects will be financed in a region, in a country, but in neighboring regions, in two or more countries.Unfortunately, this is true only for a part of the resources, that is, only for the interior borders of the EU.However, precisely the regions located next to the borders with third countries need an instrument that works for cross -border cooperation.The regulation induces, as if this were also so.However, it is not so.It happens that the commission has not modified the regulation for years, although Parliament has been demanding it for a long time.Looking ahead this means for these regions that will be produced again in degradation in the form of transnochado promotion of marginal areas.Since 1996, Parliament asks for cooperation with third states to constitute a fund to eliminate difficulties.Nothing has happened.Difficulties are still dragging to the detriment of the affected regions.Parliament again demands here an improvement and cross -border cooperation, and we hope that a common fund is constituted and that the regulation will be modified once again in collaboration with the other commissioners.We want a Europe for citizens and not a Europe of bureaucrats.Mr. President, a third of the European Union money is spent on funds for all kinds of development objectives.It seems great to my group if this is able to overcome the differences with regions, cities and population groups more disadvantaged or if health conditions and the vital environment are improved.It is a matter of solidarity and progress.But the distribution of more and more money is no guarantee that it is spent better and better.	es
It would have been better if we had tried to reach a compromise by formulating a common position.I am of the opinion that, in this way, the European Parliament is excluded from the debate precisely when a particularly interesting development is underway in the European Union which sees the much clearer processing of a large socio -economic program.The Portuguese presidency presented a large programmatic document in view of the extraordinary summit of Lisbon.The Commission has adopted the same approach within the framework of its five -year program, also mentioning one of the four priorities.Also the document that the Commission has produced for the Lisbon summit refers to a wide setting that embraces numerous areas.I am convinced that this is the right path: the development within the European Union of a large socio -economic approach, also because it is starting from this economic entity that politics arises.I believe that, in this regard, the European Parliament will be able to play a limited role both in Lisbon and in the context of the meeting in which we are invited to participate in June.But what positions will we have to take in those locations?Will we just have to recognize that we are still nailed to the old existing political oppositions?Mr. President, honorable deputies, I would like to thank the Assembly for the seriousness and acrybia with which he worked in the first place.The auditions of experts and the debates in the Commission provided us with additional information of considerable quality.Furthermore, during the debate this afternoon, important differences were identified as regards possible policies.However, I believe that I can see some elements of consent.We are all agreed on the fact that the current economic situation is positive and that one must try to progress and exploit the opportunity of the moment in order to improve circumstances and achieve a marked improvement in the field of employment.I would like to focus only briefly on these issues and instead deepen the last point that seems to me a priority in today's debate.Yesterday, as some of you observed, the commission for economic problems illustrated the improvement of the situation of the economy in Europe.We can believe that this positive trend, already highlighted in the perspectives in November, can even prove better than the initially expected.The growth of employment continues at a good rhythm.It is true that inflation, despite yesterday's figures, must be controlled - we have reached about 2 percent according to the latest December data -, but it is equally true that the subject inflation highlights that inflationary tensions are due to very precise elements, such as the rise in the price of oil and, of course, the trend of the exchange rate.At the time of the presentation of the report, we have already referred to any risks of growth.We have highlighted the possibility of finding difficulties in American growth and therefore in other areas of the world, as well as the possibility of a certain recovery of inflation.This recovery of inflation can be significant especially if it ends up generating an inflation of costs.For this reason, we reiterate the need for a wage policy compatible with the inflation definitions that we intend to establish.	it
Let me be allowed to thank Mr. Andersson for the rest he gives to his main question and to answer them as follows.First, Finland and Denmark have exceptions to the principle of free movement of goods until 2003. These countries are busy taking preparatory measures in order to be ready for the free access of alcoholic products by 2003. In the case of Sweden, the situation is somewhat different.In 1995, it was decided to set up a five -year derogatory period, a period which is now expiring.I have yet heard any argument on the basis of which the Commission should consider an extension of this period.Second, we have a permanent consultation process with the Swedish government.I can point out to Mr. Andersson that I will go to Stockholm on March 6 to chat with the Minister Ringholm, with members of the Swedish Parliament and, on request, with the Prime Minister or other ministers, with a view to continuing the debate on this file which - I understand it perfectly - is the subject of lively political passions in Sweden.Third, I naturally understand the importance of the health aspect of this dossier very well.I repeat once again that Professor Lindgren of the University of Lund said that regardless of the evolution of events in importing restrictions, alcohol consumption in Sweden will remain unchanged.The question is then of course to know where the amount of alcohol is not introduced by travelers arriving in the country comes from.The answer is that it is made in fraud or that alcohol is produced by the Swedes themselves and, as Mr. Andersson knows, it is a particularly dangerous and harmful process.That said, Mr. Andersson seems to think that the health situation is improving as soon as the import of alcohol is limited.In this case, however, not only Sweden but all countries of the European Union should start from the principle of the prohibition of any alcohol sale.We were able to observe a similar example in the United States.Mr. Andersson is certainly aware of what has been named prohibition.He also knows what resulted in the Maffia activities in the United States, where we ended up putting an end to prohibition.This simply means that you should of course protect health but not by prohibiting alcohol, as it is useless.Mr. President, it is all the same, in reality, Swedish monopoly revenues on alcohol and, if the Swedish government says that it must thus cover the costs in the health sector, this proves that it is a distortion of competition, since other countries must finance their costs in the sector themselves without having a monopoly on alcohol.What I would like to know is if you also know studies according to which moderate consumption of quality alcohol, for example Franconia wine or Bavarian beer, is good for health and would therefore reduce the Swedish budget.I understand that Mr. Posselt began to raise the tax aspects of this file.I also believe that I know that the high taxation of alcoholic products in Sweden dates back to the year 1638 and that, since that time, the State has perceived a significant part of its tax revenues from the sale of alcoholic products.	fr
But my criticism, indeed, to say it openly, my anger is addressed exclusively against those who have caused and still cause similar reactions, the Schüssel and Haider lords and their parties ... ... as well as against their representatives in the European Parliament.Honorable Poettering, I find it interesting that she is in a difficult situation today as much as the one in which I find myself, even if for different reasons.Today she has to defend something she actually does not want to defend - Mr. Schüssel - and must take note that this same Schüssel, as far as I have heard, was also excluded also by the summit of the representatives of the Christianodemocratic party.Mr Poettering also argued that the spell created by Haider could be broken only by integrating it within the political system.Instead, I argue that Haider, like other far -right movements, cannot and do not want to be integrated into this political system, in our political system, and in this Europe.Those who feed on prejudices against foreigners and minorities by fueling these prejudices, those who have mean and anti -liberalism in its political program, those in international relations keep villains and contemptuous behaviors, those who have never clearly and unequivocally and unequivocally distance from nationalsocialism, certainly do not have the intention or willingness to integrate!(Applause) It is the great historical fault of the conservatives that of voluntarily marked with the wolf waiting to be eaten.But so the wolf feeds, instead of keeping it at bay, and forces the ÖVP to self -medication.I understand very well that Europe and the civilized world want to have as little as possible with such a government.However, there is also another Austria, Austria which, with thousands and thousands of citizens, has shown against participation in the government of the FPö, Austria that will continue to demonstrate against that government.I ask this Europe to give that Austria its support and help.(Applause) The stronger it will become this Europe and the more it will monitor the authoritarian tendencies inside, the more effectively we can fight against the roots of the right extremism.Because Europe is and remains the greatest guarantee against xenophobia and demagogy, yes, even against the return to barbarism.Support the Austrian people against this government!(Applause) Mr. President, this is a historical moment because we see that the European Union is finally becoming a community of values ​​and principles.This becomes even clearer right now, when the government of a member country is about to be formed with the support of a party that, you know, does not respect these values.I also wish to emphasize that the concerns expressed by the fourteen member countries belonging to the Council is justified.The fact that the question concerns the composition of a government of a country of the European Union means that it also falls within the competences of the Council and, therefore, cannot be considered a mere internal deal of Austria.As members of the European Parliament we must commit ourselves more to underline the importance of the work done on the strengthening of fundamental rights.	it
This would force all the main industries of the European Union countries to pay billions of pounds or euros, and this cost would affect the price and therefore on the buyers of new cars.Since the European motor vehicles manufacturers began to produce many tens of years earlier than Japanese manufacturers, Koreans, etc., they would be burdened by a greater weight, to the advantage of their competitors in other countries.I congratulate the Honorable Florenz, the honorable Lange and the other deputies who have tried to overcome the fracture within the party and to reach a compromise based on the division of costs, and I ask you to support the amendment presented in my name and of the colleagues of Germany, Italy, Ireland, Spain, Sweden and Great Britain aimed at removing the retroactive aspect of the provision.Retroactive laws are bad laws, unjust laws and often even unasslatable.The majority of the democratic parliaments of the free world rejects them in principle, unless they are of enormous public interest, which cannot be said in this case.That's why I asked for a nominal appeal vote.We want to see who is willing to vote in favor of a retroactive law, of dubious legality, which would constitute a heavy economic burden for all future car buyers and would have a devastating effect on the European car industry.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, I would like to remember once again briefly the economic stake of this directive and renew my support for the amendments presented by my colleague, honorable Bernd Lange.In fact, these amendments present the advantage - and I would like to insist on this point - to reconcile environmental requirements and economic imperatives.The Council, in the common position, said that the car manufacturers had to bear, totally or in a consistent percentage, the costs of retreat and recycling.But as was correctly said by the honorable Lange, this solution is absolutely unjust for European manufacturers.Coming from a country in which there are actually car manufacturers, and I can assure you that it is not possible to impose, retroactively, the total intake of the costs of all the vehicles of their brand currently in circulation, that is, in fact of taking costs imposed by the 80 percent of the European car park.This solution is unacceptable because these manufacturers have not been able to integrate the environmental requirements that we impose on them in their production processes and cost prices.The common position puts European manufacturers in an unfavorable position compared to the manufacturers who recently appeared on the European market.Of course we are not here to defend this or that national interest, this or the industrial lobby, but to build a competitive Europe on the world market and defend jobs in the economic sectors in which we are actually competitive.For this reason, honorable colleagues, I ask you to support the amendments presented by the honorable Bernd Lange, which will be supported by the European Socialism Party group since in fact all the interests involved - economic interests and environmental requirements - while leaving the Member States for the methods of applying these requirements;In fact, the amendments in question provide that the systems in force in the Member States, and there are that they work very well, they can continue to work.	it
I hope that Helsinki's decisions will lead to progress in the Cyprus question, and that a new time of hope for Cyprus will break.I would welcome it if Turkey now played a constructive role in the Cyprus question.I am pleased that both the Council and the Commission welcomes the efforts of the UN to accept rapprochement talks between the two ethnic groups in Cyprus, by which reconciliation and trust formation between them should be promoted.I welcome the support of the Commission for the Cyprus, which consisting of two zones and two eternal groups, for which the United Nations has been working for so long, and on the structure of which both the Greek and the Turkish side in Cyprus should work with all the might.I am happy about the political thaw in the relationships between the Greek and the Turkish government.My hope is that this will have a positive effect on Cyprus talks.I also hope that the aids that Cyprus are available as part of the accession are partly used to promote this reconciliation and strengthening of trust, and that both sides of the separate ethnic groups in Cyprus will accept and use this money in the spirit in which it is given.We all in the European institutions - in Parliament, in the Council and the Commission - should do our best to help Cyprus in the search for a peaceful solution, through which the two ethnic groups that were separated over so many years can be brought together again.President, Dear Colleagues, Verdem Rats President and Value, Mr. Commissioner Verheggen!The ordinance for the accession aids is not exactly a figurehead for the coherent work of the Commission.This merging of auxiliary constructions leaves me the impression of amateurism.This affects both the content of the content and the financial aspect.With this, I believe that the citizens in Cyprus and Malta can hardly present the membership activities on the part of the Union as evidence that it is worth joining.Vaclav Havel correctly said today that the European Union in its political quality is measured by what it brings it.From the perspective of civil society, it is crucial what a regulation brings.With this regulation, you cannot win a broomstick in this regard.It contains external determination paragraphs and is temporary, and this does not allow itself to be shiny.The quality of an aid is measured on the following standards: Is it decentralized, is it transparent, is it close to the citizen and works?Nevertheless, for the shared island of Cyprus, this approach strategy is combined with a major political challenge.In my view, the task of the European Union is to use all instruments and also to contribute to political conflict resolution on the island.At this point I have to say that the amendment to the European Parliament is also very important to me here.The Commission and the Council also keep very hopeful speeches today.I am very, very happy that we go in one direction.	de
"The adoptions of this day are not only contrary to the treaty and grant the Union bodies more powers than those returning to it, but above all, they will produce a contrary effect.These sanctions will not affect Mr. Haider or the FPö, quite the contrary;They will strengthen them.We will get exactly the opposite of what we are looking for.It is not in this way that we must fight the racism and the push of the far right.Danish liberal deputies of the European Parliament insist that the adoption of this day does not in any case constitute support provided by the Parliament to the diplomatic sanctions decided by the fourteen prime ministers against Austria.This is why the Danish liberal deputies of the Assembly supported the very firm disavowal expressed by liberal deputies with regard to any form of xenophobia in Austria and elsewhere.We attach great importance to the possible use of the new provisions of the Amsterdam Treaty allowing to deprive the right to vote within the Council of EU ministers any country which, by its acts, violates the fundamental rights of citizens through discrimination, etc.(Article 7).The participation of the Freedom Party in the Government of Austria is a dangerous development to become the political becoming of the European Union.It is the ""belly of the beast"" which, unfortunately, appears on the political scene greater than ever since the Second World War.The European Parliament and the governments of the Union are required to politically isolate a government in which admirers of Nazism and the singers of xenophobia participate.The European Union carries great responsibilities - and with it, the members of the two main political currents, the social democrats and the Christian democrats - because by focusing in a dogmatic manner to the financial financial political of the UEM, by dismembering the welfare state, by dividing unbridled competition, it has marginalized large layers of society and it offers the extreme right -wingto enlist supporters in their neonazia adventure..Given that the regulations of the European Parliament do not allow us to present our own resolution condemning the Party of Haider, as well as all the parties of any European country what is propagating racist infamies, xenophobic and hostile to immigrant workers, we voted the resolution of compromise, without approving several expected or terms, to show our solidarity with those who, in Austria,Austrian and his demagoguery.Our vote in no way means a deposit of the parties signatory to this compromise resolution, neither to their present policy, nor to their future attitude in the event of aggravation of the threat of the extreme right.Some of these parties, which assert themselves republicans and democratic, take up, by complacency or electoral calculation, the demagoguery of the extreme right, if only by making, openly or hypocritically, the presence of immigrant workers responsible for unemployment and by making their life more difficult.More generally, those of the signatory parties which direct or direct the governments of different countries of the European Union have their share of responsibility in the influence acquired by the extreme right by carrying out a policy which, by dedication to the interests of the big employers, does not want to take measures likely to eradicate the unemployment and the misery which it thus leads to and thus facilitates the xenophobic demagogy of the extreme right."	fr
"We believe it is necessary to coordinate the development objectives and the management mechanisms of actions 2 and 3 financed by leaders with the remaining actions financed in the same areas by other community programs of cooperation and interregional and international partnership, such as Interreg, Sapard, Phare, Tacis and Meda.- (de) Mr. President, honorable rapporteur, honorable colleagues, before examining in more detail the Equal report, I would like to focus on the fundamental aspects of the guidelines for the occupation on which the report is based.The main objectives of a policy for employment at the EU level have been identified in the ability of professional insertion, the entrepreneurial spirit and the ability to adapt.These goals, apparently, should make workers and workers become as useful and usable for the economy as possible.However, an approach that aims to really and effectively eliminate discrimination should have people self -determination of the purpose.At that point, however, it would no longer be to promote usability for the economy but rather equality of rights.The report of the honorable Stenzel, however, develops well, at least in the framework of the planned guidelines.All asylum seekers and refugees should be explicitly included in the programs, which should be taken for granted.The conservatives, on the other hand, voted against in the commission.Do I ask them the following question: is the goal of your policy is to marginalize people?What is behind the idea of ​​banning to work to those who want to do it?Is this not in striped contrast with the orientation ""Professional insertion skills?""Noteworthy is also that it is a mainstreaming program, because the relationship continues to present a serious deficiency.It should be noted that women should offer more opportunities on the job market by building a greater number of kindergartens for childhood.Those who let men be able to safely devote themselves to their professional ascent and take care of kindergartens exclusively, without questioning the learned distribution of reproductive activity, unfortunately did not understand what mainstreaming means!Mr. President, honorable colleagues, the commission for regional policy, transport and tourism has approved this opinion on the Equal report in its final resolution without any vote against and with a single abstention.I expressly detect it at the beginning of my intervention to report the difference in positions with respect to the employment commission, owner of the report.The approval of the opinion by all political groups is based on the conclusions in which the issues of regional policy, transport and tourism are connected to the aspects of the fight against all forms of discrimination and inequality in the context of the labor market.Even the deputies of the Commission for Regional Policy, of course, highlighted a series of critical points in the Commission's proposal: first of all, the insufficient clarification of the thematic guidelines for the activities of the development partnerships;second, the fact that they have not yet been defined by the rigorous selection criteria commission for the evaluation of the proposed projects;third, the amount of administrative charges, probably excessive, for the management of projects by the Commission and technical assistance bodies."	it
"The Commission can undertake to regularly inform the Parliament about the published lactations.Our hope is that it also appears on the Internet, so as to ensure maximum transparency on this concrete point.Another question raised concerns the remaining information that could be important for Parliament about macroeconomic assistance.I inform you that the Commission is willing to periodically inform in the confidential basis - if the nature of the information provided - the presidents of the various parliamentary commissions concerned, in relation to the various initiatives undertaken for macroeconomic assistance operations.I thank you, honorable deputies, and I hope that with the final decision of the Council it is possible to unlock these funds and make a positive contribution that allows us to continue the considerable effort made by several parts in Kosovo for the purpose of a better situation of peace and coexistence.Mr. President, I am pleased that the points of view of Parliament, of the Commission for Budgets in particular, and of the Commission are converging.We assure that on our part we will always be faithful to any commitment aimed at supporting the commission in carrying out its task.However, after listening to the commissioner, I am a little worried about the commitments made by the services in the Commission for the budgets.It had been clearly established - I do not say that it was a positive or negative fact, but it was a contract - between the services of the Commission and the Commission for the budgets that there was convergence on the amendments nos.4 and 7, that is, that there was an agreement on the idea of ​​subordinating the release of the second share of macro -financial aid to respect the commitments made by the donors.Now, listening to Commissioner Solbes, I seem to understand that this commitment should have been taken in moderation.Signor Commissioner, an agreement is an agreement.Do you confirm the agreement accepted by your services in the Budget Commission or not this condition, which would mean a break of the commitment made towards us?No, honorable Bourlanges, I think it is a basic problem, relating to the way in which to formally conclude the compromise we accepted.I have advanced a proposal and I repeat it: the Commission will declare, in the Council decision, the following: ""The exact love and timing of implementation of the Second Tranche Will Be Decideed in two courses Taking Int account Developments in Kosovo 'S External Financing Needs and Contributions from Other Bilateral Donors.""In this way, we believe we fully respect what has been concluded.I simply ask the Commission, before unlocking the second fee, to inform the Commission for Budgets.I absolutely agree.It will be done.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.00.Altener the agenda bears the discussion on the report (A5-0011/2000) presented by the honorable Langen on the common project, approved by the conciliation committee, of decision of the European Parliament and the Council that adopts a multi -year program to promote renewable energy sources in the community - Altener (C5-0333/1999 - 1997/0370 (COD)).Mr. President, despite not being present in the classroom, I would like to thank the honorable Langen for the commitment shown in making this program pass both in Parliament and in the Council."	it
The events of the past few years have certainly been awareness of the dangers to which food safety and human health are exposed to, and has given rise to concern.The immediate reaction of parliament must undoubtedly be understood by all citizens as the most important guarantee for the future, because as a member of parliament, they have thus created framework conditions for the quality of food, according to which the Member States have to be directed.However, even in this crucial area of ​​administration, the parliament of the principle of subsidiarity is aware and asks the Member States to take responsibility accordingly and to do justice to it.With the Agenda 2000, in my opinion, we focus on politics that are of direct concern for the citizen, such as food safety, water quality, environmental protection and rural development.If we implement this agenda committed and purposefully, then the first years of the new millennium will develop into a milestone in the implementation of politics that are close to the citizens and reflect on the needs of the community.In particular, I welcome the proposed new strict approval processes for additives in animal feed.Those who demonstrably violate this must be punished strictly.I speak to Mr. Byrne, the new commission member, whose responsibility is the food security.He has a difficult task, but he reacted quickly and effectively to the requirements of this house as well as the concerns of consumers.I am particularly happy that my home country Ireland is one of the pioneers when implementing the new food legislation based on the principle of traceability.Ireland will develop into a competence center for food production of the future.President, Mr. Commissioner, I would also like to congratulate the rapporteur for his excellent work and in particular my joy about unanimity that prevailed in the parliamentary group on this point.It is therefore intended that the Commission replaces the current approvals by regulation by approvals that are bound to those responsible for the placement of the additive.It is necessary to restore a coherent legal framework.The Commission already proposed the introduction of a legal basis for the replacement of the approvals in Directive 70/524/EEC.But we have to make sure that there are no distortions of competition, as Mr. Kindermann and Ms. Auroi have already underlined.In my opinion, a clear declaration of genetically modified feed additives is required so that the end consumer is enabled and guaranteed to choose food without GMO or with GMO.The consumer must be able to freely decide in full expertise.This proposal has no financial impact on the community budget, Mr. Commissioner.Therefore, in the area of ​​food safety, complete transparency for producers and consumers must prevail.I am convinced that the commission can join the rapporteur who, as I would like to remind you - was unanimously supported in the committee for agriculture and rural development.President!Since BSE times we have repeatedly said in this house that animal nutrition is one of the most important and first elements for the safe production of food, health and protection of consumers.We are therefore pleased that the Commission presents a proposal for additives for feed.	de
"Inquiry No. 6 of (H-0122/00): concerns: Ethnic cleansing on Serbs in Kosovo since the end of the bombing of Yugoslavia by NATO and the EU with the argument to prevent ethnic cleansing on Kosovoalbanians through Serbs, and since the station of the KFOR on June 12, 1999, 200,000 Serbs living in Kosovo have been sold and 768killed.This ethnic cleaning is therefore far more ""thoroughly"" than the one carried out by the Serbs.In the past few days, Serbs have been killed by members by members Kosovoalbanian Mafiagruppen with impunity.What is the decision to the Council in order to put an end to these ethnic cleansing and to ensure the respect of human rights for the entire population of Kosovo, regardless of race and belief?Mr. President, forgive you, but when you hear the representative of the council talked like that, you really wonder how far the hypocrisy, the granting and complicity are still being driven.In the house of what is hung, you really don't talk about the rope, as a saying says with us.Yugoslavia was a peaceful country, a guarantee for stability and peace.After the interventions of NATO and initially Germany, the known events occurred.So the government in Belgrade, but NATO, is not responsible, the imperialists are responsible with their interventions.What about today?Resolution 1244 of the UN Security Council was disregarded in every respect, which proves that this was a trap.350,000 Serbs, gypsies and members of other nationalities except the Kosovoalbaners have been expelled, 900 murdered, 800 were kidnapped.Eight months later, the resolution of the security council is brutally kicked with feet.For example, the UCK was not only disarmed within three months, as intended in the resolution, but contrary to the claims of Mr. Kouchner in the European Parliament, equipped with modern equipment and appointed the ""Kosovo protection corps"".Because the Minister Mr Kouchner mentioned, I would like to point out that the latter with his 25 commands also disregards the sovereignty of Yugoslavia and the resolution of the Security Council.He has introduced a separate currency, his own judiciary ... (the President interrupts the speaker.) We see the facts in the eye, Mr. President.I would like to thank the Minister for his answer, but also remind you that statistically speaking, more violence is carried out today in Kosovo than before NATO's bombing.It is worrying that the bombing tightened the situation, and it should admit that NATO and the European Union's approach, when they took this measure, was wrong.The Minister has fully right - I agree to him - about Belgrade's fault, but one should not forget that the secret services of the United States, Germany, France, Italy and Great Britain have delivered the Uck, a mafia, weapons and money to contribute that there are problems in this area.That is why we are all guilty.I would like to ask you an additional question about your reference to the overall context.Are you not of the opinion that it would be advantageous to lift the blockade against Serbia so that there is greater economic norm in the area and also benefits Kosovo as a province of Serbia?"	de
It is something that certainly benefits everyone.To ensure that the treaty is respected and that we support what has been described as community machinery, we are taking the measures we present yesterday in our statement.And we will continue to do so, Mrs. President, with impartiality.It is our duty.It is also a matter of conviction.My last observation is as follows: We understand the context of this fundamental debate.There are several people here who, like me, have become accustomed for many years to the offensive statements of Herr Haider, to the xenophobia of many of the elements of his policy and the strategy he has developed to alternate aggressive statements with apologies, sometimes in successive days.We understand that and also remember its sometimes short and selective memory of Nazism.And when we remember that, like many deputies from all the trends of this assembly, my instinct and that of my colleagues, it wakes up naturally.But the commission must act on the basis of values ​​and laws and not only on the basis of instinct.And to this obeys the conclusion we arrived yesterday morning.Therefore we support that conclusion while we continue to defend the values ​​and the law.Without fragility, without self -complacency, without ambiguity, but at the service of the entire union and each of the member states of the Union and its peoples.We will continue doing that with energy and coherence and, as Mr. Cox has said in the debate, we will maintain a close surveillance.Given that Mr. Da Costa listens to these observations from the bottom of the Assembly, I wonder if Mr. Kinnock could confirm that the Commission supports the opinion explicitly declared by Mr. Da Costa today and in the recent declaration of the Presidency on behalf of the Heads of State and Government.Does the commission support the Council?.(In) Mrs. President, when the commission said yesterday morning that he takes note of the opinions expressed as a joint declaration of fourteen member states and that he shares the concern that has given rise to that opinion, I think we can give a discounted that since yesterday morning, as soon as he could deal with the subject, the commission has maintained an opinion consistent with that fourteenth of the Member States.Thank you, Mr. Commissioner Kinnock.I think we just lived a great political debate, at the height of the situation and what we could expect.I thank you, Ladies.The debate on current problems, urgency and special importance is closed.The vote will take place at 11.00.Resources at the beginning of precaution in accordance with the agenda, the Commission proceeds to make a statement on the appeal to the precautionary principle..(En) To begin, I want to say that I am pleased to present this communication on resources at the beginning of caution, which has been written in collaboration with Messrs. Byrne and Liikanen.The precautionary principle is not a new concept.	es
In fact, these programs have been important elements of participatory democracy, of citizen logic for Europe.Therefore, the Leader + concept must conserve all the positive aspects of the previous programs.Consequently, an issue arises strongly: after ten years of success of these programs, why continue limiting the Leader + to an experimental role?Does so many other European actions can boast of having made 800 specific original experiences with remarkable success?How much more time will the commission relegate to the leader to experimentation, instead of introducing it to the general concept of rural development mainstreaming?On the other hand, I have doubts about the limited orientations to which the commission wants to reduce the leader +.At the moment when, Mr. Commissioner, after Seattle, we Europeans fight for the multifunctionality of rural development projects, why get locked among some reductive criteria, with extremely insufficient means?An environmentalist speaks: the precautionary principle, stable development, require a much more diversified and much more multiform approach.In this regard, the Commission proposes to further reduce the cooperation actions of local action groups, limiting them only to candidate countries to expansion.It would be much better if there were a reinforced coordination between the Leader + and the community programs of cooperation and partner, such as Interreg, Phare, Sapard or Meda, as proposed, by the way, the Regional Policy Commission.Indeed, it is good to be supportive of Eastern Europe, but it is not enough.We must not abandon the tradition established by the previous programs with the countries of the South, in particular with those of the Mediterranean area.Therefore, once again, we can emphasize that what is missing in the agricultural and rural development is codecision, which would really allow us to have the necessary means to advance programs of this type, which require cooperation and transversality.Mr. President, I want to make very short observations.We are discussing the programs period and the orientation of the four community initiatives without having a single essential and integral evaluation of the previous period available.This is very negative.Generally, programs and objectives are exaggeratedly optimistic, however, the results are not always enough, and yet, often the opacity and complication of the projects leave a very broad margin of poor administration and even fraud.The community initiatives we are talking about can play an important role in certain conditions.But it is necessary not to submit them to objectives and aspirations of a more general, social and economic negative policy, and that they develop their independent role.For example, the adaptation of the equal program to the objectives of employability and flexibility of labor relations transform the initiative into a new version of labor agreements.The extension of the Leader initiative to all areas of the Union contains an even greater danger of marginalizing the least favored regions for the benefit of the most developed.The Interreg initiative must include eligible regions placing a special emphasis on the border, island, mountainous and non -mountainous regions such as the province of Arta, in Greece, which is exempted from Annex I of the commission's communication.	es
In all these issues I will make the greatest effort to follow the recommendations of your Ladies.I also want to bring up the political conclusions that, otherwise, already know all the deputies, but whose main elements would like to remember.Lords, on the path of real convergence, significant progress has been made, especially in the four member states of cohesion, but also, Mr. Pohjamo, I say it frankly, in the regions of objective 2 that have gone through certain delays in the level of their development, especially in relation to infrastructure.This is the first political point.Second political point: the structural funds contributed and will continue to contribute a significant contribution to this approach process.All the macroeconomic models on which we work indicate, for the past decade, that more than a third of the convergence obtained in the unreveloped regions would not have occurred if the structural funds had not existed.However, I have taken a good note, in particular, the ultraperiferic regions, Mrs. Sudre, Mr. Fruteau, and also Mr. Nogueira Román, that his lordships affirm that there is still much to do - and here is my third point - about the plan to improve the content of the recovery of employment, of the fight against social exclusion, of particular gravity and unbearable in many of our regions, of the integration of women andYoung people in the labor market.The fourth political point is the extension of the Union: the great political and humanistic project of the future years for our institutions, and also the greatest challenge for the cohesion policy in Europe, a point on which Mr. Van Dam has insisted.I think especially in the ISPA, whose application I will be responsible in the coming weeks.The lords are already seen: we have just launched our new programming, and we are already making a reflection on the impact of the extension of the union, our structural policy.This sixth periodic report, on which Mr. Berend has issued a globally positive judgment, constitutes for us, at least for me, a good base of reflection.Therefore, I would like to thank you very sincerely for this contribution to the reflection that we have initiated for the next orientations, while for the good application of the orientations of the period 2000-2006.Thank you very much, Mr. Commissioner.The debate is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow at 12 noon.(The session is raised at 8:25 p.m.) Approval of the act of the previous session The act of the previous session has been distributed.Is there any objection?Mr. President, I respond to an invitation made late yesterday by the president of the Assembly to speak on behalf of my group about an issue referred to in the minutes.	es
"If it serves as Consuelo, in Ireland they do not have their channel still.Apparently there are some technical problems of difficult solution, but we are working on it.Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to clarify it.I am not sure that our Dutch colleagues are fully convinced, because our Irish colleagues cannot capture a national chain.I think you have to study what should be done so that all our colleagues can access their own chain I thank you, Mrs. Banotti, extensive to the other quausers, for the efforts you will make in this regard.Mrs. President, I would like to tell Mr. Wurtz that the Brejnev doctrine of limited sovereignty is not a doctrine of the commission, and that, except proof to the contrary, we are not within the framework of articles 6 and 7. Consequently, Austria has every right to form a government and the president of the commission has all the right, and even the duty, to express his best wishes to Austria.Mr. Wurtz should remember that not long ago, some colleagues from his party, French communist mayors, sent bulldozers against immigrant homes in France.Order of the works in accordance with the age of the day, the definitive project of order of the day is proceeded as established by the Conference of Presidents, in accordance with article 110 of the Regulation.a) Sessions from February 14 to 18, 2000 in Strasbourg Wednesday: the president.Since the Council will not be able to attend Wednesday afternoon, several groups -European popular part, European socialists, liberals, green, unitary left, have requested that we deal with the Declaration of the Council on the Chipriota question and the report of Mr. Brok on the pre -pre -adhesion strategy of Chipre and Malta, and that we advance these two issues, together with the report of Mr. Swoboda, in the report of Mr. Swoboda.Therefore, we would have for Wednesday, the two statements of the Council regarding the coherence of the policies of the Union with the Development Policy and the UN session ""Human Rights"", followed by the unique discussion about Cyprus, and secondly of the opinions of Mr. Swoboda, Mr. Corrie, of Mrs. Fractions and Mr. Knör Borràs.Who wants to present this request in the name of these groups?As no one wants to intervene, I submit this application to vote.(Parliament expresses its conformity) Thursday: the president.- In relation to current, urgent and most important problems, I have several amendments.In the case of human rights, I have two inclusion requests: one of the group of liberals for the sub -party entitled ""Cambodia"", and another of the Green Group, for the sub -section called ""Pinochet"".As you know, the ""Human Rights"" section cannot encompass more than five issues.Currently, there are four registered issues, according to the list included in the final project of age.Therefore, we can only contemplate one more."	es
In Europe, after the Amoko Cadiz or Urquiola on the Spanish coasts in 1976 or the Torrey Canyon in the same year or so many other cases, we really started with corresponding legislation from 1994 and 1995 and especially in the past few years.In addition, in the past few years, the security of passenger traffic was generally concentrated.That is the reality.In my opinion, huge effort must now be made in order to tackle the new problems that are also derived from North American legislation, whereby the safety of the sea transport of dangerous goods must be in the foreground.I have addressed a number of questions that we can treat it in more detail, if you want it in more detail and more precisely in a meeting with the committee responsible for this topic or then if I will introduce you to the specific initiatives in the coming months.My declared intention is that we will start the discussion from the end of March, which also coincides with the Council of Ministers, and that of course we already have texts about which we can discuss before the end of the half year of the Portuguese presidency.The cheap flags are a problem, but not the only one.Romania is not a cheap flag, and yet it has a very high index of events in inspections.More than the cheap flags.Malta and Cyprus have applied for their admission to the community.We have to make our demands on this question and this is negotiated.This will force us to reconsider the registers of the European Union and to address the famous problem, which will surely reappear, the demand for a community register.I think this is difficult, but in any case the registers of the countries of the European Union have to be checked.With regard to the controls, a high -level key question, as Mr. Hatzidakis said, we first have to check how the legislation works that we already have.Because we already have legislation.According to the information provided by the Commission's services, this legislation is not adequately applied in many member states due to lack of personnel, funds and inspectors.The problem is not that only 25 % are checked, but how the selection is made, how the ships are determined with the greatest risk: after the age of the ships or after the risk history of the flags.Unfortunately, the 25 % are sometimes covered by flags, of which you know that they will meet all the requirements: the inspections go faster and the work is easier to do.Therefore, it will be less about making changes than taking measures to control what is already done, apart from some complementary claims in relation to revisions, especially depending on the age of the different ships.In addition, there are Solas (international convention to protect human life at sea) and marble (international convention to prevent marine pollution by ships), two Convention of the International Sea Consumption Organization, which must be made mandatory in all countries of the Union and their application must be checked.With regard to the question of the inspectors of the Union, I believe that the principle of subsidiarity justifies that these inspections are carried out by the Member States, which should not mean that the Commission does not have to control whether the states correctly perform their task correctly.	de
"If your financial responsibility is compromised, greater control will be exercised.Finally, coordination of maritime authorities is necessary to achieve a kind of European device analogous to the coasters who monitor the coasts of the United States.In the first place, I would like to thank the colleagues of my group that deal with the environment and who have addressed this problem together with the transport team.This disaster is as environmental as transportation and is not limited to a sector.Once again we are in this Parliament debating on another maritime disaster.I could recite the list of disasters that have affected that industry in the 10 years that I have been in this Parliament, but I only have three minutes.There is no doubt that it is time for not only member states, but also that tiger tooth called International Maritime Organization and the oil companies and the owners of the ships - to those who fit no less responsibilities - assume their responsibilities adopting measures to end those ecological and human tragedies that are repeated year after year.How many Erika more will we have to endure before those who have the power give us a control of the status of the ideal and effective port throughout the European Union and not only in certain areas of it?How much pollution should we bear before the industry gives us ships with segregated tanks and double helmet?How many more sea birds should die before maritime transport companies put an end to the procedure of cleaning their deposits in the sea, which, as our resolution points out, cause more contamination than any disaster of the type of Erika?While I recognize that some advances have been achieved in sectors such as control by the state of the port and norms on minimal crew, we continue to face what our deceased colleague Ken Stewart called ""ships of shame that enter our waters of the European Union and leave them: rusty cubos and with poor crew.""It is necessary for Member States to act quickly and decisively.It is necessary that our governments contribute the financial resources necessary to provide us with effective control and also stop giving the matter of maritime security long.Erika has not gained human lives, but it may have ruined the livelihoods of many people.Just like it is business, just like the braer.There is no doubt that the three left us an ecological disaster.My group expresses its condolence to the population of Brittany that has seen its area looted by that disaster, as it was also expressed on previous occasions to the population of Western Wales and that of the Shetland Islands.Isn't it time for us to stop expressing condolences and start communicating requirements to get rid of those ships of shame for the safety of the seas?Otherwise, later we will discuss, this same year, a new resolution proposal when another ship-cistern with convenience pavilion sinks and pour its crude from the whole sea."	es
Expressing our solidarity, as a European Parliament, first means acting to obtain immediate unlocking of emergency aid to families affected by black tide and, at the same time, demand a qualitative, European and international scale strengthening, of the rules and safety standards of maritime transport to establish much more frequent controls and clearly more dissuasive penalties for the offenders.Our proposals refer in particular to the age of the oil tankers.Among those who were controlled and considered offenders last year, 15 were twenty years or more, some more than thirty and even more.That is no longer tolerable.In addition, convenience pavilions.According to the International Federation of Transport Workers, more than 40 percent of ships shipwrecked in 1998 carried a convenience pavilion, a symbol of the benefit and exploitation of men to the detriment of security.That is no longer tolerable.Finally, the lack of transparency.Everything possible to make the most opaque as possible the concatenation of the responsibilities and identity of the owners and those who really decide.That is no longer tolerable.In all these planes, we must obtain real and significant changes, including the fixation of a limit date for the observance of new norms, including double helmet, under penalty of prohibition of anchoring in the ports of the Member States or crossing its territorial waters.We must also achieve greater rigor both in the issuance of navigability certificates and in the verification of age and the maintenance of ships.Finally, we must ensure that all those responsible for a catastrophe contribute to repairs.In the present case I think, in particular, in the total-flin group.The European Union can, Mr. President, to do the same management before the International Maritime Organization.This will demonstrate its usefulness before a public opinion that this time awaits clear and concrete acts.Mr. President, Mrs. Commissioner, as a representative of the French Atlantic coast, representative of Vendée, I would like to express first of all the feeling of rebellion of the victims of the Erika black tide before the disasters caused not by a natural catastrophe like the hurricane who has just hit us, but for a crime.With the urgency, given adversity, a magnificent impulse of solidarity has been manifested: local solidarity, national solidarity, intergovernmental solidarity.What the sinister populations now expect, who have lost everything, in particular among the professionals of the sea and tourism, those whose activity is committed to several years, is not only that pollINATORS repair the damage they have caused, but also that everything necessary so that their current misfortune serves in the future to others to prevent the repetition of such crimes.We are paying - it is more than obvious - the price of our left.Because our states, with the blessing of the community, have not considered it appropriate to continue having their own merchant fleet and have let a rigorous expertise in the field of naval construction disappear, we no longer have a clear traceability of the ships and see authentic ships-base Surcar our waters with a pavilion of convenience, at the mercy of the short-term interests of the multinational companies.	es
When the contracts come into force and what final form they will have depends on the implementation also depends on the implementation by the contracting parties.In the United States, the WIPO contract has already achieved legal force in the form of the digital Millenium Corporate Act, whereby this legislative measure has managed to maintain the delicate balance in the sense of the WIPO.The EU must also make progress in accordance with the agreements made in the WIPO.It is also questionable that the statements adopted by the previous parliament do not support the balanced WIPO system.The statement in the first reading of the copyright guideline had a inclination and the balance was shifted in a manner that was disadvantageous for Europe.The proposed recommendations do not promote the position of culture in Europe, on the contrary.Rather, the changes brought in by Parliament improve the possibilities of the media groups established on the existing market to put their old market shares of over 80 % by rigid and oversized copyright regulations in a new framework.So I am not talking about the recommendation of Charlotte Cederschiöld, which I think is an excellent document, but of the treatment of the topic copyrights by the last parliament.In particular, I would also like to thank Ms. Cederschiöld to clearly define the concept of so -called intermediate storage in her report.In the WIPO contract, this type of reproduction has not been given a conscious position.If these technical copies are subject to protection, the data transmissions - as is rightly stated in the recommendation - are more expensive and complicated.This is as if a postman would have to pay a license fee if he has a book to read the consumer.The actual advantage of culture is to be able to bring art and knowledge safely and easily from the artist directly to the user, the consumer.The new activity environment is above all a huge opportunity to create and spread culture in a different way than ever before.It is essential to take into account the interests of all parties.The parliament tried to meet this aspect in its recommendation.President!First of all my compliment to the rapporteur for the work she did.According to the Commission, she worked quickly and precisely.That is not unimportant.The Commission would like to express its recognition to the rapporteur.Right from the start, I would like to say that the Commission agrees with the conclusions in the draft of a recommendation and therefore agrees to ratification by the parliament.I would like to highlight the importance of both contracts.With the Wipo consulting law contract and the WIPO contract for performances and recordings, we make progress in the international protection of copyrights and the related rights and thus a significant improvement in the Bern agreement and the Roman contracts.Both contracts contribute to better protection of works and other things, but enable the public to access the content offered in the networks.The two contracts expressly allow the community to become a contracting party and to have a say in the control in this area.The consent of the community to the contracts is of crucial importance because it shows how much it is due to intellectual property rights.	de
The third incoherence is related to human rights.It is said to want to protect them.Developing countries are encouraged to respect them.They even vote multiple resolutions to condemn each violation of these.We also echo the protests, of international campaigns.However, at the same time, the trade of weapons is allowed to develop, without worrying at least to limit the trade of the most atrocious weapons: antipersonnel mines, for example.Nor is much done to really prevent human rights violations.The fourth incoherence of the European Union cooperation policy is as follows: How do you want to help development by looting the natural resources of the countries they help?It is necessary that the European Union leave its fish to local fishermen to nurture local populations, instead of systematically destroying seabed with their intensive fishing.It is necessary to leave the raw materials to local producers so that they transform them.Let's not talk about oil, since unfortunately we know the policy of groups such as ELF or total in Africa.To go further, and that will be perhaps the fifth incoherence, we ask that biodiversity be respected, among other reasons to allow everyone to produce with their own seeds and preserve natural wealth.However, at the same time, and we still saw it during the last negotiations, ACP countries are obliged to sign the Trips agreements, when they run the risk of being expanded to living organisms.This extension would therefore mean the death of biodiversity and return to de facto slavery for the small farmers from the south to the mercy of multinationals.On the other hand, and this is a sixth incoherence, the application of existing treaties is not defended.Thus, on the one hand, a budgetary endowment is voted for the fight against AIDS and, on the other, nothing is done by imposing that mandatory licenses be met within the framework, precisely, of the aforementioned Trips, which would therefore allow developing countries to produce their own medications and curb the hecatombe caused by AIDS.In the same sense, during the WTO negotiations, and when the Schwaiger report observed, from the second section, that broad sectors of the population of developing countries, especially the poorest, barely benefit from the current process of liberalization of exchanges, the European Union continuesnecessary to reinforce it, especially for the poorest countries.The eighth incoherence is political and practical.It is always said: to think globally and act locally.However, local development agents are neglected, preferring to argue with national governments, subsidize North NGOs at the expense of local South NGO programs.Agriculture, environment, are other problems, other inconsistencies that could also have been mentioned, not forgetting research, emigration or health.In summary, it is intended to want to help developing countries and, at the same time, market liberalization is stimulated, recognizing that it is against that objective.	es
What should be done with this money?Human rights deserve special mention.West has fought for human rights in Kosovo.What currently happens in the area?The massive expulsions orchestrated by the Serbs have been ended, but despite this there are virtually every day unacceptable situations in which people are killed or lived where and how they want.Every day aggressions against Serbs, Rome and Bosnians are recorded, while attacks against Albanians continue to occur.Actually, the news has frightened me, if it is true, that an Albanian doctor, who has undoubtedly worked in very difficult conditions in the hospital of the Serbian part of Mitrovica, has been forced to stop attending to his people in that hospital because he received continuous death threats.They are incidents and situations that we cannot tolerate.The news has come to me - I don't know if it is true or not - that the Serbs continue to exploit a mine in Kosovo, in the Serbian part.Rumor runs that Serbian militias remain active.I do not care if it is a Serbian, a Rome, a Bosnium or an Albanian who receives threats or is killed in Kosovo.I don't care who tries to divide and separate Kosovo.What matters to me is that the organs that we finance get what we want to achieve, namely a multiethnic Kosovo, a Kosovo of coexistence.We need more police officers, since the current forces are insufficient.We need independent justice -fed hard -we also need means for the High Commissioner for Human Rights.All this should be done and the sooner it becomes better.If we take for help, the situation will make it worse, with the risk of new conflicts and crisis situations.For this reason, it seems correct that we have acted quickly, that we have recognized the urgent character of the operation and that we free the funds.Now, we want to see facts and we also want to see results in Kosovo.Therefore, I ask the commission to ensure that money is destined for effective purposes, especially to the organization of the Police and the Organization of Justice..Mr. President, thank you, in the first place, the deputies, and especially the rapporteur, for the speed with which they have dealt with this issue.It will undoubtedly allow us to free Kosovo's funds quickly and face the concerns that both Mr. Swoboda and Mrs. Pack have raised us.In tonight, I think I perceive three fundamental types of concern.In the first place, although much progress has been made, and we could refer to the administration of Customs, to the Banking Administration, to the Tax Administration, it is true that we have to move forward.Go ahead to finance what?There we have a first point of a certain disagreement.You raise us in any of your amendments that are established more limitedly the type of entities referred to in the contribution of the financing of the Union.For example, in amendments 3 and 5.	es
This is certainly the best boost we can give to democracy in Europe.If, in this way, we abandon the culture of the fifties to engage in the new century, we can say that we have experienced a very beautiful moment.Mr. President, I first address my congratulations to Michiel Van Hulten for his first report.It was a famous hazing but, as popular wisdom says, the best way to learn to swim is to throw yourself immediately.Dear colleague, after such an event, I think you can qualify for the Olympic Games!In my opinion, two points deserve the particular attention of my group.First, there is the individual responsibility of the commissioners.This point must be set at the intergovernmental conference.We certainly do not want this important question to be left to the entire discretion of the council.Consequently, we have filed an amendment in which we ask if it would not be possible to conclude an agreement between the Commission and the Parliament so that we have a kind of retirement position rather than leaving our fate in the hands of the Council.The second point that my colleague, Mr. Mulder, has already mentioned, is that, according to the European Party of Liberals Democrats and Reformers, the Parliament should also be examined by independent experts.This would contribute enormously to the restoration of the confidence of European citizens in our institution.We can only be both an opponent and a credible partner of the reformed commission that if we recognize our wrongs and if we put on order inside the European Parliament.It is only by reforming all of the European institutions that we will obtain from democratic, dynamic and transparent Europe that our fellow citizens deserve.Mr. President, I would also like to congratulate my colleague Van Hulten at the first work he presents in the Assembly.I am convinced that it will serve him, among other things, so that his second report gains flexibility and for him to seek to reach a greater consensus between the different groups.Now, the Commission reform process claimed by citizens cannot be postponed.This parliament has heard many occasions, including on the part of the Presidents of the Commission, the wish that it is reformed.It now seems that it becomes more serious.After the resignation of a commission and the demonstration of an almost unlimited number of inadequacies by an expert committee, the promise made by Mr. Prodi on September 14 to present before this assembly a complete reform project for the month of February is logical.Parliament anxiously awaits this complete reform program.The report that we are now debating is trying to give a political force to a good part of the recommendations of the Expert Committee charged by this Parliament.Mr. Prodi said that in any case he would act, that he would of course prefer to succeed, but that the fear of not reaching his goal would not prevent him from acting.Therefore, we ask that his program be courageous, because, if this is the case, I can assure him that Parliament will be on the side of the Commission in this reform process.	fr
Mr. President, I would also like to start by thanking Corrie for his excellent report that, in my opinion, he describes and properly summarize the work done in the AU-EU Joint Assembly in 1999. My intervention time is short and I want to take care of two issues.The first of these refers to the fight against poverty that, in my opinion, begins to be an embarrassing story for both the EU and the Member States.Although both in the treaty and in the UN meetings in Rio and in Copenhagen we have committed ourselves to work to end poverty, in reality cuts are made in the budgets for development aid, contrary to what has been said to be done.You have to stop this trend.We have to start by condemning debts.You have to start putting action behind the words.I would like us to have an important role in this work.The other thing is that, on many occasions, we say that ACP countries have to learn democratic foundations.In points 2 and 3 of the resolution, in the framework of the new convention, work methods are developed and better.ACP countries will be urged to express their opinions to many political currents.In my opinion, this is very good, and it is something that I give my full support.However, we must also ask how we understand democracy.How works in the Delegation of the European Parliament before the ACP-EU Joint Assembly?Contrary to how things work here in the European Parliament and in the parliamentary commissions, in which speakers are proposed and designated for the reports, in this delegation before the Joint Assembly there are no rules.The two large groups distribute all the reports with each other.To change this anti -democratic situation, the Verts/Ale has presented the amendment 6. In it we ask that the speakers of the general reports and memories, in addition to the members of the working groups, are designated according to clear and democratic norms.In this context, small groups and their representativeness must be taken into account.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, dear colleagues, I want to congratulate our partner Mr. Corrie for the quality of his report that relevantly reflects the content of the debates of the Joint Assembly whose co -presidency assumed very effectively.The eradication of poverty has been the central theme of our works, and to achieve that ambitious objective, many auditors caught attention to the need to preserve a fundamental tool: I refer to preferential agreements between the European Union and the ACP countries, within the framework of the Lomé Agreements.It was a considerable challenge.The globalization, the liberalization of exchanges, as well as the preeminence of the WTO and the World Cup philosophy that she vehicle threatened the very essence of the North-South dialogue.	es
We must end at all costs to the irresponsibility waterfall, irresponsible charterers, unenforceable shipowners, complacent certification societies.Now, today we are immersed in the greatest confusion.These issues should be discussed - it is more than evident - in the worldwide, but the current international standards are very insufficient and much more laxist and neither our countries nor the community have tried with a determination to make them more rigorous, despite recent catastrophes.It is true that the International Fund against Hydrocarbons Contamination (FIPOL) exists, but dilutes the responsibilities and its level of prescriptions is totally insufficient, and should be checked.The question of the convenience pavilions within the framework of the IMO must be imperatively reviewed.It corresponds to the Member States and the community to adopt the necessary initiatives for that purpose.I have to remember that Erika carried a pavilion of convenience of a candidate state to enter the union.On the other hand, there are community directives, but they do not apply or apply little due to lack of a sufficient number of national controllers.You have to urgently remedy that lack.For many years, a directive on maritime security has been in preparation, but progresses very slowly.From that point of view, there is an inadmissible inertia and unacceptable lack by the commission.The date of presentation of the communication of the Commission dedicated to that essential issue, perpetually postponed and now planned for July must be advanced imperatively.As for the substantive provisions that must be established, they must be particularly clear and strict.I will mention three that our group considers priority.First, the responsibility of the owners of the oil cargoes must be clearly established and the victims of the pollution must be able to establish judicial actions without ambiguity against those responsible.The best prevention for the future is the certainty of charterers that, if they are not extraordinarily vigilant on the safety of ships they choose, severe civil, criminal and financial convictions will receive.Secondly, the condition of a double helmet for oil tankers to which community waters is allowed and should not be left for Greek calenders should be imposed as quickly as possible.Thirdly, a strict limitation of the age of ships to which community waters is allowed to be set up.It could be fifteen at most.If a sufficiently clear, strict and rigorous community regulatory framework is not achieved, the Member States that wish, on the other hand, to establish it to protect its population and their territory, in the same way that the United States have known, on the other hand, to take advantage of the teachings of the catastrophe of Exxon Valdez, demanding the double hull and seeing its waters to all the ships of more than twenty years.Thus, the United States denied Erika access to its waters.If the community had done the same, an immense catastrophe would have been avoided.	es
According to the Commission, the convent responsible for the development of the fundamental rights chart must take into account the task that is given to him by the European Council of Cologne.However, this does not mean that the convention would have to limit itself to a codifying function existing in different sources.As I already had the opportunity to carry out this parliament, the Commission is convinced that the convent may have to be able to adapt and develop these rights taking into account current circumstances, in particular technical and social development.In view of the mandate and the final purpose of the text to be presented by the head of state and government, however, this option must be used with caution and only in case.The rights awarded with this charter apply to at least two groups of people.Part of everyone in the area of ​​the Union benefits from the Union in the area of ​​the Union, only the Union citizens.It is also conceivable that certain economic and social rights are granted only Union citizens and, under certain conditions, nationals are granted by third countries.At the present time, since the process of developing the Charter is still at the very beginning, it is still premature to want to go into more detail on the content of the charter.However, it is clear that the principle of equal opportunities and equal treatment of men and women will certainly be one of the rights guaranteed by the future fundamental rights chart of the Union, since it is already included in the EU contract and the derived law and is undoubtedly one of the joint constitutional traditions of the Member States.As I have already presented before this parliament, the Commission is to include this charter in the contract.However, it is aware that the final decision is the responsibility of the state and heads of government.The not easy task of the convention is therefore to develop an ambitious and politically significant text, which can easily be included in the contracts.In its statement on the convening of a government conference to change the contracts, the Commission points out that the European Council must decide on the admission of certain topics in the agenda of the government conference in the course of 2000, including the fundamental rights chart of the European Union.Mr. Commissioner, it is extremely important that the citizens of Europe, men and women, are called up at the beginning of this new century to re -determine their rights and duties.We hope that the significant decision of the Cologne Council will really be fulfilled with life.The globalization on the one hand and the expansion on the other hand make the fixing of these rights only appear more urgent.Seattle has given the reason to seriously think about many related problems, and hopefully the European Council of Nice will not come together for nothing.However, in order to ensure the participation of the citizens in this new project, we would like to know which plan the European organs, specifically the European Commission, proposes for the social and democratic model of the Europe of the 21st century.I have heard something about her general line and now I would like to ask which space is intended for the children as an independent individuals in this project of the European Commission for a new social model of the 21st century.Mr President, Mrs. MP, I have to tell you very clearly that in my opinion and according to the statements of the President President President President from this morning, the development of the Charter is a politically very important process because he shows that the Union places the fundamental rights of its citizens on all other political concerns for the future of our joint project.	de
At that time, the interpreter of the general emotion in the face of the disastrous consequences of this disaster, the Council expressed its concern about the security of the oil tankers and the protection of the environment which must be associated with it.The council was not insensitive to this type of question and the need to take additional measures in this area.The importance for the Council to take new measures on the community level, and as part of its own work with international organizations, was highlighted at the time.As you know, in the current state, community legislation obliges the port authorities to perform inspections on board all foreign ships, including those who beat complacency, and immobilize them in the event that they do not meet international standards.There is a 1995 directive in this area.With regard to the future, the Council noted that the current reflection process at the level of the Commission will soon lead to communication on the security of oil tankers and to new proposals aimed at strengthening controls, as well as qualifications for inspection organizations.It is also planned to strengthen the structures of oil tankers who frequent community ports.These files are followed by the Council of Ministers of Transport and I can assure you, on behalf of the Council, that we will grant the greatest priority to the proposals that the Commission will present in this area, in all likelihood.This seems essential to us in terms of environmental protection.Of course Parliament will be called upon to also decide on these proposals, since these are materials subject to codecision.I am delighted that the council reflect on this question.The chairman of the council is from a country, Portugal, which is directly threatened by a situation of this kind.If we think too much, by next summer, an oil tanker subject to such conditions could very well sink off the coasts of the Algarve, destroy the Portuguese tourism industry of the summer and, with a little luck, the sea currents could take this pollution to the island of Madeira - because they follow this direction - and, in addition, also destroyingCanaries.Does the president of the council not believe that we must stop thinking and start to take draconian measures in this area, taking into account that today we already have the means necessary to control this type of oil trees on the high seas?In any case, the history of Erika is a story that seems comical.A French boat, beating Maltese pavilion, with an Indian crew, with a navigation certificate issued by Italy, Sicily, and the last inspection of which was, I think, carried out in Bulgaria.The boat was flowing, the captain saw him well and knew that he would not even come to the nearest port.I think it should not be allowed.The damage can be catastrophic for your country, Mr. President, and for mine too, Spain.	fr
This kind of procedure is a current practice since the programs or legislative measures are too often equipped with funds inadequate to the ambitions!Böge report (A5-0023/2000) as a European deputy, and above all of a citizen-consumer, I express my satisfaction for the proposal of the European Commission which marks a further step forward in the direction of an improvement in food safety in the European Union.The proposal is twofold: on the one hand, it is a matter of modifying the 1991 council directive relating to the conditions of health policy by eliminating the provisions concerning the disease of the sheep's trot, or scrapia, and, on the other, to define a new regulation that establishes provisions for prevention and fight against some transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (east) or eSb types that affect the sheep andOther animal species.The positive aspect of the new legislation consists in the fact that a specific legal base is created for the fight against the Scrapia.My satisfaction is even greater as it was one of the main requests contained in the control and evaluation report following the crazy cow crisis.Moreover, it seems to me indispensable, in an intent of consistency, to merge the existing legislation relating to the disease disease, limited to the commercial exchanges of sheep and caprini, in a single mechanism complete with new provisions governing the East that affect all animals in the European Union as a whole, in order to prevent the consumption of food or food products.This regulation is also appropriate because doubts continue to remain on the disease of the sheep's trot.According to some scientific hypotheses, this disease may have evolved to change into ESB in cattle and therefore be at the origin of ESB epizootia.At the time, of the clarifications and the strengthening that are necessary, in particular as regards the identification and fight against the Scratpie, the proposal of regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council containing provisions for the prevention and control of some est represents a considerable improvement.It is a guarantee for European citizens who have repeatedly expressed their concerns against European food policy, concerns that, taken from the European Parliament, have been heard.The discussions relating to the precautionary principle, to traceability, responsibility, transparency led the European Commission to present a white paper on food safety, which offers different food for thought and in particular has proposed the creation of an independent European food authority.All this is part of a European strategy aimed at regaining consumer trust.It is up to us European managers to demonstrate that single market and free movement of goods can be combined with food safety!Report Cederschiöld (A5-0008/2000) Mr. President, I voted in favor of this provision on the reorganization of the legislation concerning copyright because I believe it is one of the most important sectors in which the activity of the European Parliament is expressed.They are of the opinion that the product of the ingenuity is much more important than the constructions, tangible products, which we can precisely see to touch, while as ingenuity and science, which also cannot be touched by hand, arise of great importance that we, as we European community, should support much more actively, not only through the protection of patents but granting facilitations and support for scientists, to those who - by taking advantage of the teachings received -They use to give future generations something much more important than we have had in the past.	it
Therefore, we support the amendments 78 and 79 that prefigure a minimum of safe standards regarding telephone listening and videoconferences.On the one hand, we await with great attention the result of this vote in order to avoid emptying all this agreement - that, I repeat, already establishes minimal standards - and, on the other, we are in favor of waiting for any proposals that arrive from the Commission so that this minimum community right is finally prepared.Mr. President, no doubt that, given the growing phenomena of organized crime at international level, the Member States should cooperate as much as possible, or better, the institutional conditions should be established to implement a concrete and effective process of cooperation in the judicial field: a process that, however, must face all the necessary stages to avoid that there are inappropriate forces to the detriment of the legitimate indications of the legitimate.regarding which Member States are sovereign, and especially to avoid forcing that end up belittling the fundamental rights of citizens.Consequently, it is necessary to act with caution before a text such as the Council, in which, as the rapporteur has also stressed, after years of debate, it is now intended to solve everything in a few months.In addition - I share the valuations of Mr. Di Pietro - the text of the Council seems even too rich in contradictions, incoherent formulations and lagoons.Obviously, justice, more than any other sector, cannot be treated incoherent and contradictory.In our group, the report as a whole seems very debatable, despite the introduction of some corrective amendments, sensitive to the protection of personal freedoms and respect for national sovereignty.In the report, too heterogeneous materials are addressed, there is no gradation and proceed by approximation.In conclusion, we will vote against this report reiterating that the Europe we want must be a Europe of rights and guarantees: rights and guarantees that require gradual and responsible reflections, as well as very serious deepenings.In the first place, the general rules must be established, institutional certainties, and only after the establishment of practical agreements may be proceeded.Mr. President, on behalf of the deputies of the Bonino list, I want to confirm the position we had in the Commission of Freedoms and Rights of Citizens, Justice and Internal Affairs and, consequently, also announced the vote on behalf of our deputies: a vote against this report, or better, a vote against the agreement on which the report is based.However, I want to thank and praise the work of the speaker who has heard very carefully what we held in the Commission, in particular about the issue of the rights to defense both at the national level and in the field of cooperation in criminal matters of European legal assistance.The commission and the rapporteur have accepted nine of the eleven amendments that we have presented and that are based precisely on the rights to defense.	es
I have not yet become aware of any arguments that the Commission should extend this deadline.Second, we keep constant contact with the Swedish government.I can tell Mr. Andersson that on Monday, March 6th I will travel to Stockholm to lead talks with Minister Ringholm, with MPs of the Swedish Parliament and, if necessary, with the Prime Minister or other ministers and to discuss this matter in more detail, which - I am completely aware of - wakes up enormous political desires in Sweden.Thirdly, I naturally understand what importance the health aspect is.I would like to repeat that Professor Lindgren from the University of Lund will remain constant in Sweden, as always, the import restrictions may work out.Then of course the question arises where the amounts of alcohol came from that are not introduced by travelers.It replies that this alcohol is smuggled or manufactured by the Swedes itself.I do not need to point out her, Mr. Andersson, how extremely dangerous and harmful to health this procedure is.Well, Mr. Andersson obviously thinks that the state of health will improve if we limit the import of alcohol.In this case, not only Sweden would have to, but all countries of the European Union would have to assume that they would be forbidden to sell alcohol.For this, the United States delivered an example.Mr. Andersson, the ban called prohibition at the time may be known.And he also knows how it affected the activities of the mafia in the United States, where the prohibition was ultimately lifted.With that I just want to say that you have to protect health, of course, but not with an alcohol ban, because that doesn't help.President!In reality, it is about the income from Swedish alcohol monopoly, and when the Swedish government says that it has to cover health costs, this is proof that it is a distortion of competition, because other countries have to finance their health costs themselves without having an alcohol monopoly.My question relates to whether you also know studies that the moderate consumption of alcohol of high quality, such as Franconian wine or Bavarian beer, is even health -promoting, and therefore even relieving the Swedish state budget.If I understand Mr. Posselt correctly, he wants to go out to the fiscal aspects of this matter.As far as I know, the high taxes go back to alcohol -containing drinks in Sweden to 1638, and since then the state has moved its tax revenue to a considerable part from the sale of alcoholic beverages.As is well known, Sweden currently has the state monopoly, which in turn does not comply with EU law.Well, as far as the healing effects of alcohol is concerned - because that's what I think, Mr. Posselt, too - I can fully agree with him: in my opinion, a good bottle of wine can be extremely health -promoting and, even if you are in society, can definitely raise the mood.Perhaps Mr. Posselt, Mr. Andersson and my person can meet a glass of Aquavit at the bar of Parliament in the next few days.	de
These are the consequences of it!Therefore, we can only ask the Commission to continue to be soothing and to pay the recognition that are committed to continuing independence and sovereignty of the Austrian people and do everything to ensure that this people remain free and continue to behave in solidarity towards the other peoples.President, dear colleagues, the today's debate is all about hypocrisy: The Council dislikes the contract and uses a procedure that is absolutely not covered by Article 6 and 7, which enable a country to conduct a country in the event of serious and repeated injuries.In the present case, there are no serious and repeated injuries in Austria.There are risks - we are all aware of it - but at the moment there are absolutely no injuries, neither serious nor repeated.If the criteria of Article 6 and 7, the criteria of Copenhagen - compliance with the countries of Eastern Europe - were to be applied to our institutions, to the European Union, this European Union could not become a member with great certainty.When it comes to serious and repeated injuries, then we should perhaps mention certain Member States like Italy and France, the most common or most common in the Council of Court.We, dear colleagues from Belgium, should speak of the Dutroux affair, about the many children who have been kidnapped, displaced, raped and murdered by celebrities of this country, and always run in the seam.Dear colleagues, with a third of the MPs, we could force the council and the Commission to deal with it.We could ask ourselves why the Austrians defend themselves against a party rule that corrupted and spoil their country for ten or thirteen years, but which also spoils Italy, Belgium and other member countries of the Union and drives to corruption.We should really ask ourselves, dear colleagues, why 76 % of the Belgians have absolutely no confidence in the judiciary of their country, why 56 % of the French have absolutely no trust in their judiciary, why 53 % of Italians have absolutely no trust in their judiciary ... (The President deprives the speaker the word.) Ms. President, my parliamentary group, the EDD, and especially my party, feel very affected by this debate.We cannot support Mr. Haider's views and politics in any way.We regret his allusions to the Third Reich.But we also regret the fact that Parliament intends to interfere in the politics of a elected government of a country, especially if this country is part of the European Union.My party at home is certainly not racist, but we don't like to see it very much if the European Union makes us regulations or interferes.Will you get involved in the UK parliament when we are chosen?Mrs. President, the Austrian people, released his vote and chose Mr. Haider to his parliament.I think Mr. Haider gave 28 % of the votes;So there will be a coalition government.	de
"We not only regret the processes in Austria, we are agitated and deeply disappointed.We ask the ÖVP to ultimately check other solutions.We always come back to Article 6 of the Treaty.We are still fighting against the trivialization of the extreme right.If the coalition occurs, we appeal to our colleagues of the ÖVP, both in programs as well as with word and deed for the respect of the principles and values ​​that form the foundation of European integration.Austria faces great responsibility.Ms. President, ladies and gentlemen!It is obvious that in this parliament we agree in the rejection of Haider and his politics, but it is also also clear that we have different views in the question of how this policy can be combated most effectively.Did you ask yourself how this debate here and the explanation of the Council Presidency from last weekend in Austria?Have you once asked yourself whether we are also responsible for how the political situation in Austria is developing if we swing in here for the judgment?Did you ask yourself what happened if a colleague's wish were fulfilled and will be in Austria in the next few days?According to the agreement of all observers, Haider would become even stronger.Who can want this?Don't we have the responsibility of considering how we combat this policy?Europe is a community of law.The principles we are responsible include democracy, respect for human rights and the rule of law.It is part of the democracy requirement that you do not have to find election decisions well, but have to respect, and that is why we have to respect if the Austrians are decided in their politics for reasons.It is a question of the rule of law that the chairmanship does not comment as he did, in a way that contradicts the contract.It is a question of political cleverness not to isolate the ÖVP, but to support the ÖVP as a undoubtedly democratic, constitutional and proven European party in the fact that Austria remains a member of this European community as well, and therefore the ÖVP colleagues must have our support in this difficult situation, and isolation is absolutely the wrong way!(Applause) Mrs. President, at home, people say: ""A welsh needs three attempts"", and three times, as you can see in the course of this debate, I have expressed the wish to be able to go into briefly on this excellent and sometimes moving debate.First of all, on behalf of President Prodi and my colleagues in the Commission, I would like to thank the commission for the support and understanding that a whole series of MPs of this house has given the position of the Commission, which we have expressed in our explanation yesterday.Of course, I also have to react to the fact that in the course of the debate - and I use a few terms used - there was talk of ambiguity, complacency and the careful behavior of the Commission."	de
Food safety therefore requires total transparency for producers and consumers.I am convinced that the Commission will be able to follow the path indicated by the speaker, who, let's not forget, has obtained unanimity in the commission for agriculture and rural development.Mr. President, since the time of the ESB has been repeated in this classroom that the feeding of animals is one of the fundamental elements for a safe food production, for the safeguarding of health and consumer protection.For this reason we welcome the proposal presented by the Commission on animal feeding additives.The commission on behalf of which I intervene, namely the commission for the environment, public health and consumer policy, starting from the assumption that the president of the commission for agriculture in his role as a speaker would have developed an excellent report decided in December to renounce his opinion.Nonetheless I would like to express some consideration and take a position on some points.Firstly, on the issue of the legal base.While having a new regulation in this parliament - and it can certainly be given that, given the ambitions of the President of the Commission for Agriculture, problems of competence in legislative competence between the Commission for Agriculture and that for the Environment are increasingly arising - in cases of conflict of this type, in my opinion it is always necessary to keep in mind an aspect: the cohesion of this parliament is decisive and the legal basis is in my opinion.Therefore - I can't help but reiterate it, Commissioner Byrne - condemn the choice of the legal base.Although it is only a legal basis taken from previous directives, it is a mistake to keep it.The Treaty of Amsterdam is extremely clear in this regard: if human health is called into question, the legal basis to be chosen is article 152Therefore the political group to which I belong - as the honorable Kindermann has already said - tomorrow will vote in favor of the change of the legal base and I hope that the other political groups do the same.Commissioner Byrne, for the purposes of transparency and a positive collaboration I invite you to welcome and approve the change of the legal base.Otherwise, if followed by the indications of the legal commission, we would open the doors to manipulation.Leaving the Commission the choice of the legal basis on the basis of the fact that in the text the policy of health protection is not mentioned, it was resorted to article 37. I am allowed to focus briefly still on two other points.As for genetically modified microorganisms in the feed, I believe it is inadmissible that reference is made to vertical legislation and it is said that sooner or later other rules will be needed.For the moment we don't have them!Therefore, in the absence of a different legislation, whenever we approve of the rules we must also deal with genetically modified bodies, cite them expressly and insist so that they are declared on the label.This is what the speaker did and it is a positive indication.	it
"On the other hand, if the new negotiating cycle of the World Commerce Organization began during the Portuguese presidency - what nothing is not sure at all -, we will not like to ensure the consolidation of the presence of community production on international markets and a greater balance between the EU agricultural products of export and the preservation of that multifunctional European agriculture to which I have just mentioned.The Portuguese presidency will also attribute great importance to the deepening of food security policy and I think that the Portuguese foreign minister, and president of the European Union Council, has already referred to this aspect this morning this site.The role of food safety, to the extent that it is linked in particular to public health, is a fundamental element that our presidency must develop and constitutes, however, one of the priorities of our program.We will develop it on four parallel lines, as part of the ""Consumer protection"" Council and the ""Internal Market"" Council.The Portuguese presidency will present a report in this regard to the European Council of Santa Maria da Feira, which will be held in June of the current year, in particular in light of the provisions of the Commission in his White PaperWe believe that the work to be carried out on these basis for the establishment of a European agency is essential to give credibility to the internal market, to consolidate trust in this same market, to dissolve some tensions created between the Member States in this sector and also - why not say it - to define a common attitude of the European Union in relations with third countries in areas that are re -flowed to food safety.This is the goal that we set ourselves to reach during the Portuguese presidency and we hope, in the end, to be able to present the result of our efforts in the classroom.I thank the president in office for his reply.I am sure that he is aware of the very serious threat placed on the European model based on family -run farms, especially for farmers who operate in the sector of cattle and sheep's production sector who should now sell their products at equal or lower prices for production costs.I would like to ask what new initiatives, the Council can undertake to safeguard their interests in the next interviews on trade in the world, in particular, against the type of production practiced in the racks and in the farms of the United States and New Zealand, whose economies of scale make it extremely difficult for European farmers to be competitive with the production methods applied in their companies, and where, as is obvious, the European standards in the field of food safety are not applied.I perfectly understand his concerns and I realize how much greater efforts and greater consistency are necessary also within the European Union.We must also think of the consequences, especially in the field of funding and compensation for farmers.However, as well, the question is in the hands of the European Commission and the latter will have to carry it on.The Council has a limited intervention capacity in this area.Mr. President, I too would like to welcome the President to the Chamber of course."	it
"Mrs. Commissioner: Andalusia is not Lapia.I would like to listen to the commissioner's opinion on the amendment 45. I may have escaped me when he announced the list..(En) I accept the amendment.Thank you very much, Mrs. Wallström.The debate is closed.The vote will take place on Wednesday at 11.30 am.Financial instrument for the Environment (LIFE) In accordance with the agenda, the recommendation for the second reading (A4-0014/2000) is debated, on behalf of the Environment, Public Health and Consumer Policy Commission, relative to the common position approved by the Council with a view to the adoption of the European Parliament Regulations and the Council on the Financial Instrument for the Environment (Life) (Slap.Lienemann)..(Fr) Mr. President, we already had the opportunity to examine that report in the first reading, and in commission I thought there was a broad consensus within this assembly.Life is the only budgetary line of direct intervention in environmental matters included in the community budget, and it is necessary to recognize that it is not up to our ambitions since for several years the amounts that are assigned to it remain frozen: despite the expansion that took place when we renewed the first Life program to move on to the second, the credits were maintained as is.And it turns out that more and more, the regions, the different operators, the companies and the associations present Life projects for both Life-Naturality and for Life-Medium Environment;That these projects are of very good quality, since after having been submitted to the consideration of the competent committees, all agree to comment that they would deserve the support of the European Union, and yet we cannot finance them due to lack of budgetary assignments.We must also remember that the rate of consumption of the credits of that budget is exceptional within the community budget.It is therefore evident that it is a very well adapted tool to the policies we want to develop.I will insist in particular in the field of life-nature.We know that a series of directives related to ""habitats"" and ""migratory birds"" run into application difficulties in the European Union: with life-nature, we should be able to support policies that demonstrate the feasibility, legitimacy and the ability to fulfill the objectives set by those directives.And we are losing that legitimacy due to the lack of credits, allowing the idea that our European directives are not reasonable or applicable.The debates that are held today focus on two major issues: first of all the committee, eternal debate within our assembly, but our Parliament wantedCommunity philosophy of which we are guarantors here, within the European Parliament.But these committee debates arise with respect to most financial programs and financial tools in the European Union.It seems to me - and the contacts we had tend to prove it - that it is easier to reconcile the views on the committee than on the budget."	es
I also propose that the withdrawal of salmon that present clinical signs of the disease should be immediate.To introduce the withdrawal plans, the procedures already existing in Community legislation will be used for the introduction of additional control measures;These plans will be based on the actual health conditions of the salmon in order to reduce the possible environmental impact to the maximum.In this regard, I accept the amendments nos.7 and 8, the latter with a slight change.I am also in favor of amendment no.9, but I believe that it must be formulated better in order to also include environmental issues and strategies of eradication and control of the disease.I do not believe I can accommodate the amendments nos.12 and 13 as it seems to me that they are aimed at zeroing the risk.I believe that this goal is very difficult to achieve without causing the closing of the sector farms.I would like to know Parliament's opinion on these amendments and know if he thinks that this approach represents the best way to act.I can also partially accommodate amendment no.11. Finally, I want to emphasize that we will continue to fight to maintain a high standard of protection of public health in accordance with the obligations provided for by the Treaty.I believe that measures in line with this goal must be proposed to go on.We will continue to commit ourselves to eradicate the disease, to the advantage of both the environment and the salmon industry.I will be extremely grateful to the Parliament if, in accepting the proposal, it will recognize our commitment.Thank you, Commissioner Byrne.The discussion is closed.The vote will take place tomorrow, at 11.00.The protection of novels The agenda bears the discussion on the A5-0035/2000 report, presented by the honorable Gallagher on behalf of the Commission for Fishing Commission on the proposal of the Council Regulations containing fourth modification of the Regulation (EC) n.1624/94 which establishes technical measures for the conservation of fishing resources in the Mediterranean and fourth modification of regulation (EC) no.850/98 for the conservation of fishing resources through technical measures for the protection of novel (com (1999) 552 - C5-0040/2000 - 1999/0222 (CNS)).The proposal under consideration, broadly described in the introduction, is very important.My colleagues from the Commission for Fishing and Parliament know that our work on technical conservation measures is based on concrete technical indications.The institution in charge of providing these indications, based on certain scientific tests, is the Commission for the conservation of tonnids in the Atlantic (ICCOT).This intergovernmental organization on fishing, which also includes the European Union, is responsible for the conservation of tons and similar species in the Atlantic and the adjacent marries, including the Mediterranean.It was established in March 1969 and, although formally required to meet every two years, meets every year.It makes its decisions on the basis of scientific indications and therefore formula recommendations for the conservation of fish resources.The ICCT operates through four permanent committees, consisting of national experts, who deal with research and statistics, finances and administration, compliance with the rules, as well as conservation and management measures.There are also four working groups that deal, respectively, of the tons of the tropical area, of those of the northern temperate area, those of the southern tempered area and other species.	it
While taking into account the new rules introduced by the Treaty of Amsterdam, which provide for its entry into force after at least half of the Member States have adopted the agreement, I would like to invite Member States to do everything possible to rap this convention quickly.Unfortunately, the experience made on the occasion of rates of the conventions of the European Union in the field of judicial cooperation in criminal matters is disappointing.This agreement will not create a new or different system of judicial assistance;Its purpose is to be based on consolidated and tested mechanisms, which has already been operating for a long time, such as those provided for by the judicial assistance agreement of the Council of Europe, from 1959, and by the Bennelux Treaty.The project developed by the Council contains provisions on various issues that have been discussed by many Parliament deputies.An important conquest of the Convention is that, where possible, the Member States to which all the formalities and procedures indicated by the requesting Member State is made.This is particularly important for the possibility of using the tests obtained in court.In addition, requests can be submitted directly between the competent authorities without having to pass through the central authorities.In general terms, there are two types of provisions: those that impose the obligation to offer assistance - such as the provisions concerning the phone and videoconferences, supervised deliveries and the interception of telecommunications - and those in which no obligation is imposed, but a simple legal framework is established for the Member States that want to collaborate in the prescribed manner - for example, the provisions concerning the common investigative teams,infiltration operations and sending and offering procedural documents.The Commission welcomes with particular favor the inclusion of provisions that deal with new or modern investigative techniques, given their effectiveness in the fight against organized crime, which thanks to its own location can take advantage of the opening of the borders.It is all too easy to be dragged by the obvious need to improve the effectiveness of criminal investigations.However, we must not forget an essential aspect of any action on criminal procedures: defense rights.I really appreciate that the report of the honorable of Peter, to whom I pay homage to the excellent work done in such a short time, includes the rights of defense between the fundamental points.Currently it is currently only due to the Member States to guarantee respect for these rights under the control of the European Court of Human Rights of Strasbourg.It remains to be seen if this will change with the new card of fundamental rights of the European Union, whose preparation has just begun.We must recognize that article 18 concerns a clearly controversial decision.The article was carefully formulated, during prolonged debates within the Council, to guarantee the effectiveness of intelligence activities and the inclusion of criminal investigations.As regards the criminal investigations, of which I am responsible, I take note of the invitation addressed to the Commission and the Council, by various deputies of the European Parliament, to consider the matter and address it on a common legal basis, given the importance that the interception of telecommunications can have as proof before the Court.The Commission is fully aware of the fact that the project in front of us is neither perfect nor ideal, but it must be realistic.	it
"Additional recommendations as to this way of proceeding are also in the second report of the Committee of Wise Men.Likewise, the commission, through the voice of MM.Barnier and Vitorino, as well as certain Member States are resolutely favorable.I beg you, dear colleagues, to vote for this report adopted by a large majority by the Budget Control Commission.We can once again show that this Parliament is active to prevent mismanagement and, in particular, fraud and pronounce a conviction where it is necessary.Mr. President, I am happy to be able to express myself on this report and I congratulate Ms. Theato.I believe that this is a report where cooperation between the commissions has worked very well and the result, which reaches us today, is a sober and serene relationship on an extremely delicate material.Sobriety and serenity which are particularly necessary for the development of article 280.4.Because if we had to award a price for the most difficult article to understand, the least clear, the most confused whatever the name you want to give it, the competition would be, in doubt, very harsh when the treaty is a sampling of complex items, but it goes without saying that this article is a serious candidate at this price.This is also a particularly delicate question because it is, as Ms. Theato said, the protection of the financial interests of the community which is the game. We are all aware and this parliament is the first to have cared for the need to protect the financial interests of the community.But let's be careful and, as the French say: ""Let's not throw the baby with bath water"".In other words, it is necessary to respect, within the framework of the protection of the financial interests of the community, not only and Ms. Theato underlined, the powers of the national states, but also other points which concern citizens, which concern essential guarantees.The conclusions of the Theato report save them perfectly.Starting, as the president of the legal committee and the internal market and, of course, from the deputy, I hope that, tomorrow, this report will benefit from the support of the Parliament, to a large majority, and that it will be well implemented by the Commission.Mr. President, as Ms. Theato said, it is a critical relationship.It was proposed by the Budget Control Commission and it is an initiative report.One of the reasons why we ardently wanted to highlight this aspect was that the European Union, whether we like it or not, drags behind it a reputation for fraud and mismanagement, an exaggerated reputation, but it exists.We have to do something to remedy this situation.Some of the measures we have implemented in the past have not been respected by certain Member States - let's not forget that the Member States are responsible for the execution of some 80 % of the EU budget."	fr
I don't quite understand what the commissioner said.At this point, the vase leash in Stregrennan, added to the special protection zone at the commission's request, was completely destroyed.It is clear that the activities that took place at this location are in blatant offense with European directives.You say that there will be no subsequent funding.I would like to know if you hear, at this stage, to stop funding completely until a real investigation takes place.If not, why?If so, when will you do it exactly?Is it correct and indicated that the department which has the company is also the authority which issues the license as well as that which, at the base, perceives the funds from the EU and the reverse them to a company it has 100 %?Is it fair and well indicated?What is your opinion about it?It is necessary to put an end to any community funding of the project because it is in the blatant offense of the EU directives.Even the area designated by the commissioners as a special protection zone has been destroyed.Compensation afterwards will not repair the damage caused.The first legal challenge followed the start of the development of the port of the port, at the beginning of fall 1999, without having been implemented compensatory improvements in terms of housing.This resulted that the Irish authorities agreed to restore the elimination of the Spartina Anglica, but this time by mechanical means.The use of mechanical resources has brought an additional legal challenge - this is what I referred to in my first answer - based on the argument that mechanical abduction would damage the vase leashes and would cause proliferation in the estuary of the Spartina Anglica, harmful on the environmental level.Currently, this legal challenge has not identified any conclusive result.The adoption of the necessary compensatory measures is the responsibility of the national authorities and does not require any prior approval of the Commission.The role of the commission is to ensure full compliance with the standards required by the bird directive and it is clear that damaging compensatory measures as such would be a problem.In this case, the Commission proposes to request additional clarifications with the Irish authorities with regard to the most recent situation in terms of compensatory measures and the potential problems of the mechanical elimination of the Anglica Spartina.For the time being it is, we are not ready to offer the interruption of financing for structural funds.Mr. President, the specific case raised by Ms. McKenna is unfortunately not an isolated case.There are other examples of damage caused to the conservation of special scientific zones following EU funding.Will the Commission plan to transmit instructions to all member states stipulating that if, in the future, it discovers that European environmental directives have been infringed or that adequate environmental assessments have not been carried out, not only will interrupt any future funding but it will also withdraw the funds already allocated;In other words, it will claim the reimbursement of the sums paid to the Member States?Only such a measure will discourage this practice in the future.	fr
A fair approach to the problem of speculation consists, in my opinion, in eliminating the true causes of financial disorders, not in an attempt to suppress only the symptoms by introducing obstacles to the functioning of the markets.Mrs. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, I would like to reconstruct the procedure and the ideological tactic that led to this oral question in short, also because I know how many social democrats to Parliament, and not only experts on economic and financial policy, share our criticism.We know the problem.It is the instability on markets caused by speculations.However, it should be remembered to those who presented the oral question that - as the commissioner explained incisively - not any form of instability is a consequence of speculation.The Tobin Tax could not have avoided the crises at the SEE level in 1992 and 1993 nor the monetary crisis in the 1997 Southeast Asian. The authors of the oral question do not hypothesize any solution, but ask for a new tribute, more bureaucracy and a measure contrary to market mechanisms.They propose an intergroup evaluation in the classroom excluding the competent parliamentary commission, in contrast with different decisions of Parliament.This question, I say it in no uncertain terms, is motivated in my opinion by ideological reasons and does not aim to find solutions.I believe it is the wrong road.Why do we reject the Tobin Tax and consider it with so much suspicion?First, as the commissioner has already affirmed, because it represents a strong burden for the capital markets.Even a minimum taxation would entail heavy repercussions on the capital markets, since such a tax on speculation would reduce the profitability of investments to considerable extent.Furthermore, such a measure would strongly compromise the development of financial markets, contrasting the principle of free movement of capital which represents one in the central nuclei of the internal market.Second, capital invested for speculation purposes is difficult to identify.Third, tax measures can be easily circumvented, if they are not introduced with the same system in all countries, because too many escapade remain open.Fourth, this measure is difficult to apply from a technical point of view and involves a high degree of bureaucracy and administrative charges with the impossibility of effective control.The measure we should adopt is a part of the resolution today.It is a matter of strengthening banking supervision, of clarifying the responsibility for transactions, of creating an international regulatory framework, of evaluating national laws in order to verify if they comply with the rules of the Basel Committee and to understand how the latter can be more widespread.Regarding this resolution, I have a strong doubt about a fundamental point that we cannot accept in this form.I refer to paragraph 9. From the intervention of the Commissioner we deduce that the examination of the Commission will end with a refusal of the Tobin Tax.If this assessment, the current debate and the arguments proposed are of the tenor that has emerged and that I share, also the fact that the commission is dealt with for another six months with the consequent insecurity that will affect the financial and capital markets represents a lack of responsibility.	it
Regarding China, we should not give up approaching the question simply because discussions in the matter could be blocked.However, it is imperative that the EU speaks and acts in Chur, and threats of commercial sanctions should strengthen our resolution instead of weakening it.However, if we want to give full expression to the decisions that may be taken in Geneva, then the office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights must receive the necessary resources.The United Nations financial resources are distributed chichement and, because of this, many essential programs depend on voluntary contributions in order to survive.Resources are also necessary to promote practical cooperation and human rights, strategic planning, definition of priorities and the strengthening of communications between the Donor Community and the United Nations Member States.To this end, the high commissioner recently launched an annual call of US $ 53 million to allow her office to carry out these tasks.The European Union and its Member States should take the initiative and contribute to a large extent to the granting of these funds.By doing this, not only would we embarrass the United States, which should assume their responsibilities in relation to the financing of the United Nations, but we would also demonstrate that our commitment to the defense of human rights is more than simply rhetorical.Mr. President, in this debate there is mainly question of the preparation of the United Nations Annual Assembly devoted to human rights which must be held soon and the efforts of the Commission and the Council on this occasion.I must first say that I am very happy with the contribution made until now by Mr. Patten and by Mr. Minister, and I also find good that China and Cuba are also the object of the debate.Cuba remains the last dictatorship in South America and we should not forget it, despite all the sympathy that some here and there can experience for Cuba.It is a dictatorship and therefore not a democracy.During the two minutes attributed to me, I ask for your attention in order to look into two countries to which I feel particularly linked.The first is Indonesia.We are obviously very happy that Indonesia now has a new government and that Mr. Wahid and Mrs Soukarnopoutri occupy the presidency and the vice-president respectively.We also welcome what the situation in Timor evolves slowly in the right direction.However, I point out to you that in the Moluccas, an archipelago located just north of Timor, violence has not yet been mastered.Thousands of deaths have been counted in the past two years.Tens of thousands of people have fled.The situation is not well in hand.I know that, tomorrow or the day after tomorrow, a whole program will be devoted to Dutch television there and that we beg there that observers are sent to the region so that they can realize what is exactly there, so that the facts are in any case registered, for after in particular, when human rights commissions will be able to go there.My pressing request is this, and it is also a point which has been mentioned several times in resolutions: Can not consider sending observers to Moluccas?	fr
We make a positive global value judgment on NATO's intervention and share the opinion about what NATO's action was.Regarding the political prisoners of Serbia, it is evident, honor, when I refer to the circumstance that in that country Mr. Milosevic does not behave today according to the norms of a decent society at the international level, I refer exactly not only to what Mr. Milosevic does with his fellow citizens, but also to situations that maintains, in particular, in matters of political prisonersdemocratic, against opposition access rights to social media, against facilities that must be granted to non -governmental organizations to act, in particular in the level of defense of human rights.However, all this is only one of the many aspects of the extremely pernicious performance of Mr. Milosevic in the field of Yugoslava society and, of course, the European Union cannot be worried about this situation, which is why, while Yugoslavia does not have a behavior at the international level that satisfies the values ​​that, in our opinion, we must defend, will maintain all the sanctions.Question No. 7 Formulated by (H-0035/00): Subject: Drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights expressing the satisfaction of civil society by the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights, but also the hope that said letter will respond to the challenges of Europe in the 21st century, the Council that responds to the following is asked: What do you think of the content of the Charter?What citizens do they refer (to those of the European Union or those of all European countries; will understand citizens of expansion and immigrants, etc.)?Will the community collection of the European Union collect, or will it have a broader programmatic character?What are the mechanisms you will use to clearly establish the equality of sexes?What does the Council of the Incorporation of the Charter to the Treaty of the European Union think?I thank the president in exercise to present the problems, and the certainties that he has expressed to me on the progress of the works.You understand, Mr. President in exercise that my question does not mean meaning, because the Council is a political body of the European Union, and European citizens, men and women, want to know what their vision of the democratic and social model of the European 18th century is.I would like, in a complementary way, ask if the Portuguese presidency has planned that the rights of children, as autonomous entities, are included in the problem that will be developed and in the rights that will be incorporated into the letter.As I said, we do not control, honor, the process of formulation of the Charter of Fundamental Rights.That issue is the responsibility of the members of that group, who will not send it to the Council until there is consensus on the tenor of said letter.	es
"In this regard, I would like to thank the commission for regional policy, transport and tourism for accepting one of my amendments aimed at adding the fes to the list of these funds.The ultra -aperiferous regions, in particular the four French domes, must be able to coordinate Interreg III and the Fes to also have the possibility to finance cooperation projects with their neighbors ACP in their respective geographical areas.Furthermore, I ask the Commission to reconsider the few possibilities offered to the ultra -aperitical and insular regions based on the guidelines presented in communication.These regions must have the opportunity to benefit from Interreg III, such as the other regions of the Union, especially since the regis program has been abandoned to them.To conclude, I would like to express my regret for the small financial allocation reserved for element C, intended for interregional cooperation, whose community added value is however undeniable.Mr. President, I intervene on the ""Equal"" relationship and on the theme of equal opportunities between men and women, even if I have to admit that sometimes it is improb and tedious to speak of a tried and retracted topic like this, especially for those who are my age.However, it is necessary to reiterate once again that equality does not exist.Maybe a breach in this sector can lead to changes in other fields.For me equality does not mean that the two spouses work all the time and leave their children to a babysitter, that is, to an immigrant, who has not been able to find another job.It is not a big step forward compared to the times of the sun: no, equality means that everyone participates in family and working life.Unfortunately, trends do not go in this sense, but in the opposite direction.It seems to me, therefore, that point 7 contains a decidedly central element: ""The Equal initiative will be used as a laboratory to develop and promote new methods of implementing employment policies"".We hope it can work.Mr. President, I just want to say, for the purposes of the results in the documents, that if I do not be in the classroom at the time of the replica by the Commission - not that I have formulated specific questions, but I hope that the Commission has listened to my intervention - it will be because at the same time as the discussion in the classroom a meeting of the Commission for women and equal opportunities on the theme of women in the decision -making process is taking place.Mr. President, honorable colleagues, those who deal with the rural space know that leading programs, be leader and leader II - and I hope that the same will also be worth leader+ - include among the flattering results obtained by the European Union with their programs.This success is also due to the strong participation aroused by the basic conception of the leading programs in the population involved in the activities.I rejoice that it has been followed by this same setting also for leader+.However, there is a problem that we must face together.Since leader acts as a laboratory, with a Bottom-up setting, in recent years in the field of leader I and II, an extraordinary number of ideas has matured which, of course, in the long run are no longer so new or particularly effective."	it
"Linking both goals is not easy.It does not arise by itself. There may be certain contradictions between the two goals, and nothing indicates that the Commission has named these opposites and showed opportunities for its overcoming.As for the other side of the agenda, Mr Commission President, namely the cohesion and regional development, we must certainly show significant achievements here.However, there are also regions that remained, especially island regions, which should be given more attention.In terms of fishing, there is nothing in her program that the devastating overfishing, which led to the disappearance of whole species, would have drawn any lessons for the future.In these things, it may be necessary to vigilance and more Esprit de Finesse.Ms. President, First of all, I would like to repeat the reminders expressed by many of my colleagues with regard to this five -year program.Despite ambitious long -term goals, we must not lose sight of the present.The chairman of my parliamentary group, Mr. Poettering, referred to this in his opening contribution with great emphasis.The Union must not take on a whole series of new tasks without having a successful European economy as a basic requirement.This requirement clearly forms the internal market.And what about the current level of development of the internal market?I would like to remind Mr. Prodi and his colleagues who are still present, the results of the investigation of 3,000 European companies carried out by the Commission itself.Almost 40 % of them state that measures to comply with national requirements for their products and services cause additional costs.So the commission itself in its investigation.These are the classic symptoms for continued disability by national governments - bureaucracy that prevents market entry.In terms of completion of the internal market, the commission's program has a disturbing complacency.We stubbornly work on dismantling other obstacles in all areas, strengthen the pressure on the Member States, which fail to carry out the corresponding measures to complete the internal market, and take decisive new areas such as financial services.We can only successfully expand the Union with an internal market as a sustainable basis.An extended Europe must build on the existing strengths of the Union.The expansion of the internal market to an extended Union should be an enforcement of enormous level.Finally, in the name of all my conservative colleagues - and we are the second largest national delegation in this parliament - assure that we will support the Commission and Mr. Prodi in the implementation of this historical task.Ms. President, Mr Commission President, Ms. Commissioner, the Men Commissioners, Estimated Colleagues!I can start with a quote: ""The commission will continue the preparatory work on a European Charter of Fundamental Rights and submit proposals for the implementation of an ambitious program. In particular, the Commission will propose that a real European asylum and immigration policy will be designed, and it speaks out for the fact that legal assistance and justitial cooperation is being strengthened and an effective approach to combat every form of crime is developed.is the entire program for the next five years on the subject of internal security, freedom, rights of citizens and cooperation between the judiciary."	de
Its funds have been invested in one of the most disadvantaged neighborhoods in the United Kingdom, Moss Side.The Millennium Youth Park project is contributing to young people participating again in the rehabilitation of their own community, and in addition to helping small businesses and supporting social policy, we are beginning to see how a very depressed urban community is sanitized.The activities carried out in the framework in the Urban initiative have been announced among public opinion in general through an active advertising campaign in local supermarkets and in famous British pubs.This is the type of good practices that should be reproduced throughout the EU with regard to communication and advertising.The specific guidelines that regulate this initiative have been widely defined to accommodate local and regional diversity.We agree that they should be indicative by nature, allowing maximum flexibility to ensure that we focus on concrete programs.In commission we are not in favor of reducing their number to 50. We are supporters of a general reduction, but we believe that the arbitrary figure of 50 is not the key factor.Instead, we should bet on good quality projects that serve as a catalyst to achieve change and renewal, to attract internal investment in the form of loans and risk capital and to achieve a multiplier effect.Member States should be able to propose a reasonable number of measures that do not exceed the economic limits of their assignments.We need to make good use of local indicators and statistics on deprivation and hygiene when designating local urban programs so that we can focus effectively on the most affected areas.The local deprivation index of the United Kingdom is a very good example of statistics and a widely used criteria that contributes to establish not only EU's help programs, but also regional and national.We should recognize this index as an instrument and resource to add to the EU criteria.I ask you to take over the local indicators to get it.The most disadvantaged urban neighborhoods face abundant problems: high unemployment rates, precarious employment often poorly paid, poverty and social exclusion.Frequently, the lack of hygiene and housing and an environment of drug dependence aggravates these problems.Consequently, there are unstable communities in which they end up infiltrating crime, drug trafficking and bands.Many urban areas know this case too well.These complex problems worsen the quality of life of urban residents, although in these areas there is the necessary potential to create growth and prosperity.This is the reason why I request in my report that the measures included in the Urban program are not limited to giving a single solution to a single problem: these areas do not have individual problems.We would have to encourage communities in urban areas to present integrated action plans to try to solve their specific urban problems using EU resources as an added value to local measures.I would like these measures to also include the improvement of hygiene and the fight against discrimination, as the Amsterdam treaty dictates.	es
While we are sitting here, hundreds of thousands of people run a huge danger due to the floods in Mozambique.It doesn't just happen.Floods have been extended for weeks, and yet it is only now that we seem to assess the needs.The level of practical assistance of the community and the Member States was pathetic.For a long time, many of us launched a warning saying that the European Union spent too much time on its project, potentially prejudicial and essentially political, to establish military decision -making structures.On the contrary, she should have concentrated her efforts on improving her civilian instruments, in particular those intended for humanitarian interventions.I recognize Mr. Patten's efforts in this direction, but what a pity that the governments of the Member States did not spend as much time to define their capacity to provide help in the event of disaster and humanitarian assistance that they devote to the dangerous operation of creating military structures which, in the end, will be double job with those of NATO and the shaking.Of course, there is a link between military resources and humanitarian assistance, and there are serious military deficiencies in the armed forces of many European countries.They don't date from yesterday, but NATO is already taking care of it.I have not yet heard any convincing explanation in terms of justifying security policy explaining the reasons why the European Union needs to define autonomous decision -making capacities for the use of the military forces not part of the NATO structures, unless it is to create bodies that will compete with NATO.After all, EU member states are either full -fledged NATO members or they sit at the table of the Euroatlantic partnership council.NATO is largely European.Finally, Mr. Solana, I just would like to ask you what it is for to have, within the Council Secretariat, the political planning and early alert cell as announced, if we are still surprised by another humanitarian disaster.Mr. President, High Representative, the Commissioner, on the war in Chechnya, we have all noted the particularly retained and almost accommodating reaction of the international community in general, and the European Union in particular.However, what happened, and what is still going on in Chechnya, is akin to a genocide.How else should we qualify the complete annihilation of a regional capital of 400,000 inhabitants, the incessant and disproportionate bombing of localities, villages, neighborhoods, where were perhaps mixed with a few Chechen fighters the entire civilian population?How should we qualify the sinister filtration camps, assimilated to concentration camps, in which the population undergoes the worst humiliations and where valid men from 15 to 65 rarely come out alive?How to qualify rapes, looting, voluntary fires, deportations, called cleaning, reminiscent of the worst episodes of the European Middle Ages?And what about the lead screed that falls on Russian and international journalists, and on the banishment of humanitarian organizations as well as any international commission of inquiry into the places of massacres?	fr
"The coordination of social policy and dialogue are good things, but we must avoid putting everyone in the same basket;The plurality of solutions must be maintained.Mr. President, Madam Commissioner, compared to the strategy that is exposed here, concerning the modernization of Social Security, I would still like to raise a few points, certain positives and others in the form of a question.I find positive the movement which extends slowly but surely to the file.It seems good to me.It also seems useful to me.I find the main lines of communication just as positive concerning the strategic approach.We also hope that the four objectives mentioned there may be achieved reasonably.We would also like to underline the interest of the way in which this file was discussed, on the one hand by the ""Luxembourg"" process, the guidelines, but we also think that the interest lies in the fact that, as Ms. Van Lancker has already specified, directives are advanced with regard to atypical work, the self -employed without staff, etc.However, we plan two problems for which solutions will have to be found.The first is that it is a question of the decline in social security, where we hope precisely that it is a level convergence.Here I would like to give some examples drawn from the investigation which was recently carried out by the Dutch professional movement on social security reforms within the European Union.It emerges from this study that adaptations take place everywhere, but that many of these adaptations, even the majority, prove to be downward adaptations, the rest constituting improvements.The vast majority of these adaptations are oriented on pensions, there are eleven limitations and two improvements.For unemployment benefits, we note six limitations and five improvements.The reasons for these adaptations are for example the improvement of working conditions, the reduction of social security expenditure, but also competition from policy and UEM criteria.This policy competition is found mainly in the Nordic countries.The greatest stability and even social security improvements are concentrated in the countries of the South.One in the other, we also observe a limited role of the social partners throughout this process.This does not seem very positive and means that the convergence strategy must be oriented on the best approaches.If I can express myself like this, we don't always appreciate cappuccino.Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the commission and the rapporteur in my turn.The Commission because it has taken a new step in the direction of the convergence of Social Security and the rapporteur for the quality of the report he provided.European Union policy includes, in addition to an economic and employment policy, also a social policy.To date, it has however remained limited both in intentions and in means.But under the influence of the free movement of employees, the internal market and the euro, the labor markets are also integrated."	fr
Thanks to the principle of partnership and parity as well as to parliamentary assistance through the joint assembly, it is a world model.It is good that in this jubilee year, which also allows us to celebrate the twenty-fifth anniversary of the cooperation initiated by the Lomé Convention, we are about to attend the conclusion of a new partnership agreement which also values ​​the role of the joint assembly transformed into a real parliamentary assembly, both for the EU and for ACP.During this retrospective, I would therefore like to limit myself to the year 1999. Indeed, our colleague Corrie has already alluded to it in an admirable manner.Most of the things that affect us today are the result of fundamental transformations observed since the late 1980s on most of the globe.This transformation process has also led to upheavals in extreme violence in developing countries.These continue to feel the side effects today.ACP cooperation is a dynamic process.From Lomé I to Lomé VI, we have observed obvious advances in the level of the successive content of the agreement.Simultaneously, the number of partner states has increased significantly and is raised today to 71. We will especially note the enlargement to Namibia and South Africa, which has greatly affected all those who took part.It is now Cuba who has just struck the door.If this country is accepted within the ACP-EU community, this will constitute progress rich in consequences which will not be without initiating a process of change in Cuba itself.ACP cooperation is therefore very much interest, not only due to the new accents appearing in the agreement.The fight against poverty and support for sustainable economic, social and cultural development constitute important objectives in order to build in the ACP countries of democratic societies and respectful of human rights.This includes in particular a strengthening of democratic institutions.On this subject, the history of the joint assembly attests impressively a positive development.While people formerly representing ACP countries at the negotiating table were mainly members of the government, civil servants or ambassadors, nearly three -quarters of our interlocutors are now elected members of a parliamentary assembly.If this representation by parliamentarians had to be 100 %soon, as the new agreement wishes, we should celebrate the event.Alas, the ongoing democratization processes go much more unnoticed than the various crises that arise in these countries.He is therefore given much less attention.Cooperation or regional integration is a specialty of ACP multilateral cooperation.One of the wishes taken up in the long list of expectations of the European Parliament will finally be carried out.Soon, the joint assembly will also be able to hold regional meetings.We have already heard of it.Strengthened regional cooperation can help prevent the outbreak of conflicts of an ethnic, economic, social or religious nature and therefore have a preventive effect.It is for the same reason that the European Parliament has always been expressed in favor of a participation of civil society in the decision -making process and in the management of cooperation and it has always stressed the importance of decentralized cooperation.The strengthening of contacts between the joint meeting and the social partners, as provided for in the new agreement, again constitutes a step in the right direction.However, there is a small inconvenience, namely that the European Development Fund is still not integrated into the European budget.	fr
"Madam MP, I recognize that all the efforts that have been made in Kosovo in this area are insufficient.It does not make any doubts for anyone, I think.I do not want to connect this question to the comments I made on the period ""before"" and ""after"" NATO intervention, we will probably come back to this point at another time of this time.However, I would like to tell you that the European Union is aware that the financial resources transported to Kosovo correspond to what it was possible to do, to the extent of the possibilities.It must be understood that our responsibility in this region is a responsibility shared with the international community.It is a responsibility in the face of which the European Union has a determined role, but we cannot pretend to quickly rebuild the structures which were not already of the best before military action in Kosovo, as you rightly recalled.Moreover, it does not seem to me, Madam, that military actions in Kosovo have contributed to such an important destruction of health structures, which have a direct effect on the current situation.The current situation is essentially linked to the dramatic situation in terms of displaced populations, it is linked to a set of elements of an economic nature and to the level of satisfaction of essential health needs arising from the general decay of the organizational structure of the Kosovo administration.This is the basic question underlying the whole current situation.There will be no solution to the problem of children's health, nor to other development problems in the region, as long as we have not solved the problem of political nature, which must be done within the framework of a resolution of the United Nations.I want to broaden the debate a little by evoking the situation in Mitrovica.The international community has reconstructed the hospital there with the aid of Europe, but the building is located in the northern district of the city, which makes it problematic for the Albanian Kosovars.This means that Albanian Kosovars remain deprived of medical care.This situation is repeated in other places in the country, provoking tensions between the Albanian Kosovars and the Serbs, the distrust between the populations being general, some not wanting to be treated by others and vice versa.I understand that you are saying, and you are right to say, that the European Union must work within the framework of a larger international cooperation association.But on which lever are you going to weigh to change the situation?What are you going to do so that the Albanian Kosovars can also be treated in a hospital, especially in that of Mitrovica?Mr. MP, Mitrovica's question is known.This is a very particular situation, where interethnic tension reaches a degree of severity fortunately absent in other areas of the Kosovo territory.I fully understand your concern.I would like to tell you, however, that Mr. Bernard Kouchner acted following a line which aims to preserve what underlies the United Nations resolution in the matter, in an attempt to create the conditions of multi -thnic structures that can serve the different communities, including at the level of the different dimensions of the administration."	fr
President, Mr. Council President, Commissioner Patten!I would like to thank you for your statements, especially Commissioner Patten, whose analysis I fully share.That's why I will not repeat anything of what he said.I just want to make three comments that may be seen similarly by Commissioner Patten, but for various reasons I cannot be formulated as openly as by a MP.First of all, I believe that we can look forward to the agreements between Israel and the Palestinian Authority.But we now have enough agreement: Oslo, Wye Plantation, Sharm-El-Heik.This is sufficient for agreements, they just have to be fulfilled.Here, however, I share my colleague Salafranca's skepticism when he says that there was bad news from Israel this week, namely that this last agreement cannot be met on time.The second point concerns the resumption of negotiations between Syria and Israel.I think this is a very encouraging message.But we also learned this week that Mr. Barak does not go to Washington and the negotiations cannot be continued.I would like to find out very clearly: If the Golan heights are returned to Syria, the problem is solved in this region.On the question of the referendum that different colleagues have addressed: We have to consider whether you always have to carry out a referendum to fulfill obligations from international law and from international law!In Germany, one would probably be very happy if we would say that we are carrying out a referendum for the payments to the European Union, and we make it dependent on whether the German people are also willing to pay.That would be a similar situation.Third and last point: the role of the European Union.I really want to pretend what the excellent role of the special ambassadors Moratinos played in the region, and also what we have done in financing there, Mr. Commissioner Patten.You know that you will always find support in this parliament, also for your suggestion.We will be there if it is to be financed.But we also have to play a political role, and Mr. Moratinos cannot play that in this region alone.The Presidency of Council has to work, the Mister GASP has to go to the region, and, as the Russians did, we have to invite the protagonists of the peace process themselves.Then we played the role that corresponds to our participation and our contribution.President, Commissioner Patten, revered colleagues, the peace talks, who recently started in the United States between Israel and Syria, are a turning point in the history of the Middle East, which we have been waiting for for 50 years now and which will certainly be difficult to master.No meetings will take place in Shepherdstown today, but we can hope, as Commissioner Patten said earlier that this postponement of negotiations due to the latest Syrian demands is only a smaller incident on the way to a peace agreement that will change the entire Middle East.This is exactly the content of our resolution: the hope of a fair and balanced agreement, founded on the preservation of sovereignty and right to a life in safety within safe and recognized limits.	de
Competition must lead to the balance between supply and demand, creating an optimal distribution of resources and economic factors.But optimal efficiency does not necessarily establish itself.To avoid abuses, framework conditions are needed, for example the competition rules.With this, only abuses are essentially avoided, but the competition alone is not able to achieve socially legitimate objectives.Yes to the competition;reduction of aid where you need and where it is possible!And precisely because the aid occupies a large part of the 1998 competition report, even if there is the report of his colleague Jonckheer I still intend to intervene on the matter: it is certainly possible and must also be legitimate to grant help to small and medium -sized enterprises active in research and development, in training in the context of regional policy, in environmental policy.For these objectives aid must be admitted, provided that they do not cause unacceptable competition distortions.And right here, even more than in the law and mergers law, it is particularly important to adopt reasonable decisions.Aid should therefore not be demonized, they must be considered differentiated, and must also be evaluated on the basis of their contribution to achieving the cited objectives.The latter observation was not both directed to the commission and to the honorable colleagues of the PPE group.Mr. President, Mr. Commissioner, honorable colleagues, the report that I am going to present you represents an opinion on the annual report of the commission concerning state aid in force in the European Union, for which the community is competent by virtue of articles 87, 88 and 89 of the treaties.The Commission's report is essentially descriptive and illustrates the evolution of state aid in the manufacturing sector and in other sectors, based on different types, as well as the methods of financing and the objectives pursued.For the quantitative aspects of the report, I allow myself to refer to the motivation and I would limit myself to indicating that, on average, the annual amount for the period in question amounts to 95 billion euros with a decrease in the order of 13 percent compared to the period 1993-1995.This decrease is essentially from the reduction of aid in the Federal Republic of Germany.In a nutshell, the declared level of state aid is on average more or less stable in the period contemplated by reaching about 1.2 percent of the community GDP, roughly equivalent, and is a pure coincidence, to the annual budget of the community.Having said that, the differences between states are high and can be measured in different ways, in particular in percentage on value added or for employee.Moreover, I believe it is interesting to add state aid to community interventions which in a certain way can be assimilated to state aid.It will then clearly notice that there are the four beneficiaries, among the other, of the cohesion fund.I now reach the proactive part of the report.Indeed, everything, we find that according to the Commission, the data, as they are presented in the annual report of the Commission itself, are too aggregated to allow a deep evaluation of the state aid policy, a legitimate but delicate situation from the point of view of national interests and undoubtedly important as regards compliance with the competition, also pursuant to the provisions contained in the treaty.	it
We always come back to the same fundamental problem of Europe: our economic life is not dynamic enough and it does not sufficiently encourage the individual initiative.The economy must be strong, so that we can take care of our loved ones and the environment.It is not politics, but the simple logic of life.Regarding the use of credits now, it is positive that they are centralized because the sprinkling will end up volatilizing them.Now we have to concentrate our efforts to solve the problems of large and medium-sized cities since they do not have enough critical masses.We will also be able to give additional momentum to the surrounding rural areas.We often forget that the problems of the cities and those of the countryside will actually go hand in hand.Everything is based on the encouragement of individual innovation and business spirit because the mobilization of masses, which begins among individuals, leads to an internal renewal of the area.Giving credits without a healthy and independent economy would be like pouring water into a well: there will be drinking for a while but the next day the well will be empty again.Mr. President, with the implementation of Interreg III, the European cooperation policy enters a new phase.Internal borders are no longer alone at the center of our concerns, those external are there too.In the context of the globalization and cultural openness that characterizes the current situation, the European Union needs instruments which allow it to strengthen its links and its communication channels with the neighboring regions, in particular the east and the south of Europe.The boundaries of the Union will no longer have an obstacle to balanced development, but - on the contrary - an opportunity, a bridge to make cooperation more fruitful.Thanks to the amendments approved in committee, the Parliament tried to complete the work of the Commission, by introducing new elements into the list of areas recipient of aid, in particular in favor of the external and maritime borders of the south of Europe.In its orientation project, the Commission recognizes that these borders require more attention than in the past.And this because of the process of widening to the east and the process of integration reinforced with the countries of the Mediterranean basin.As President Prodi recalled when he explained the 2000-2005 strategic objectives, the revival of the Barcelona process represents a priority for the Union, and the Interreg III initiative will be able to make its contribution to the pursuit of this strategic objective.While congratulating us with the very good work accomplished by the rapporteur, we only hope that the Commission will take into account proposals put forward by the Parliament, thus respecting the commitments made within the framework of the code of conduct for the implementation of structural policies, and that it confirms through changes which are imposed on the conversion of this community initiative so that the latter is no longer a simple internal instrument butRelaxation and valuation of relations with neighboring countries.Mr. President, since this year, the structural funds have benefited from an amount of around 200 billion euros until 2006. Only 5.75 % of this sum are reserved for Community initiatives Interreg, Leader, Urban and Equal.	fr
