"I know some things about reading when it comes to Filipinos. When many Filipinos read, especially the elite, read in English, although they commonly speak in an indigenous language every day. Philippines is very aural-ural when it comes to the indigenous language. There are, however, some comics and other literature in Tagalo for the masses.
